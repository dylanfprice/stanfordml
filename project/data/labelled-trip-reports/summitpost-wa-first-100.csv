multi-day,How Not To Take Your Girlfriend Camping,"Black Peak Birthday WeekendWhen my girlfriend, Annie, asked me how I wanted to spend my birthday weekend, I said I wanted to climb Black Peak with her. It is one I have eyed for several years but just never got to. It looked like the perfect one for us as it is listed as a Class 3 scramble up the south ridge with camping by a lake and I had been to the area a year before when I did the Heather Pass loop hike. I really wanted to make sure she enjoyed this one as it would be her first overnight camping trip. She has done a few hikes with me this year and used to hike the mountains in Colorado when she lived there but this would be a step up from ones she had previously done and I really wanted to make it enjoyable for her. She is pretty tough and doesn’t complain on hikes but this would be my chance to show her how great this stuff is and convince her to join me on greater endeavors as well. We drove up Friday night, stayed in Mt. Vernon, WA and were off the next morning to Rainy Pass. We stopped for lunch at the Buffalo Inn Restaurant in Marblemount which was excellent. Sunny day, things were looking good. I had a new Osprey backpack and was looking forward to the trip. We left the car at the parking lot and were hiking up the switchbacks about 1 or 2 pm. I knew that Radek and his wife Shirley were going to climb the technical Northeast Ridge route with Haydar and Radek’s brother that day and we were tentatively planning on camping at Wing Lake that night together. I also knew that Tazz was planning on being there as well so this would be a nice first overnight hiking/camping trip for Annie (did I mention this was her first time not car-camping?). We would have friends, the weather was looking great, etc. I had most of the gear in my pack so Annie would have a nice light backpack too. My new pack was working great and I did not really notice how heavy the pack was. We made it to Heather Pass without incident and took a break for some crackers and salami. This was all good and well but we started noticing how many bugs there were which I thought was strange for how late in the season it was. Anyway, after our break, we caught the climbers’ path off the main trail towards Lewis Lake which would then head up to Wing Lake. What I did not know was that the path lost several hundred feet of elevation over a large boulder field. Maybe I did not read the route descriptions as thorough as I should have or maybe it is just a bit understated in the guide books but now I was sure Annie was wondering what I had committed her to. The boulders did take a toll on Annie and of course my losing the trail did not help when we were on looser rock in this section. She tweaked her knee and was hobbling before we got down to Lewis Lake. Because of this, I decided against the more direct boulder-hopping route around the left side of the lake and opted to try to find the “trail” that was supposed to exist around the right side of the lake. It was supposed to be a bit longer but I figured a trail would be better on her knee. We got around to the right side of the lake and then the trail disappeared on the shore (or at least I lost it). We climbed up and around a small hill and started bushwhacking as the trail was nowhere to be seen. We cliffed out on the left above the lake and had to climb more. We ended up sidestepping down a steep hill/cliff with loose dirt. I about bit it when a log gave way under my feet and that is when the fun really started. Annie gave a shout, “LOOK, LOOK, B-B-B-Bears!” Below us about 50 feet was a mother black bear and two cubs. She was herding them into the brush and up a tree slowly keeping an eye on us as she had spotted us first. I looked at Annie and she was near tears and scared. I reassured her that the bears were moving away from us and had no intention of coming at us. All the mom wanted to do was to make sure her kids were safe. We had the superior ground here and she would not be looking to attack us. It took a few minutes to calm her down but we then bushwhacked more into a clear spot at the bottom of a dry streambed/meadow. We were past Lewis Lake now and the ground would soon rise in front of us up to Wing Lake. I pointed out to her where we were going to and it was not that far away. There would be people there, we’d be safe, it’s above the trees and no reason for bears to go there. No sooner had I said that when she yelled “MORE!” Above us, maybe 50 yards away on a hillside above the meadow we were in was another mother and a cub and they had not seen us yet. I yelled “HELLO!” so they would not be surprised by us and they both stopped and looked. We stared at each other for maybe 15 seconds and Annie was now clearly not happy with my choice of hikes. I got between Annie and the bears and the mother got her cub on her backside. I told Annie we would slowly arc left away from them but we’ll stay on the edge of the meadow so they can see us. We started doing that and the bears did the same thing. They clearly were not interested in us all that much as they started munching on the blueberries that surrounded them on the hillside. Everybody did the big circle thing until we were at opposite ends of the meadow and we disappeared into the brush following the rocks in the dry streambed up. Annie was actually hilarious at this time although clearly not meaning to be. I told her the thing that would discourage any more bears from meeting us was the sound of a human voice. Annie is from Germany and although she has been a US citizen for 15 years and was an English major in college, she still has a slight accent. She boomed out a loud song that went something like “Hello bears, we are coming through! I am too skinny to eat, keep to your berries! Go away, I taste like crap! The guy in front of me has better marbling in his meat anyway!” It was quite funny with the accent. Also, by now, her knee was really hurting her. She wouldn’t let me take any weight from her pack and just trudged up after me. Also, the black fly and mosquito bites were adding up on her arms, legs and neck. I found out she is somewhat allergic to the bites and her arms, neck and legs now had hard bumps a few inches in diameter welling up. Finally, the trees gave way to open heather and we actually found the trail right before reaching Wing Lake just in time as Annie started to wonder when this day would be over. My wonderful introduction into overnight hiking and camping now had her limping, and covered in welts all after walking into groups of bears. Not exactly what I had aimed for. When we got to Wing Lake, I spotted Radek’s dog, Blondie. Blondie and I are old friends going back to when we slept in the back of Radek’s truck a few years ago before climbing Mt. Washington in the Olympics. (No man-dog jokes here, you know what I mean.) I actually belayed up Radek and Blondie one time on that climb. Well, I called Blondie’s name and the tail started thumping in the dirt. She was on a leash by the lake next to a water bowl and some packs. I presumed this meant they decided to climb already today and scanned the peak ahead. There was a group of 4 coming down in the scree and I heard Radek yell “Bloooo-ndie!” They soon got to us and said they started early that morning and did it as a day trip. Seemed Radek was not impressed with the quality of the route though. While they got some food and drink, I went up to drop our packs at a campsite. I had snuck some of Annie’s favorite snacks into the pack and wanted to surprise her. I returned with her favorite jar of Nutella and a spoon and although I had just taken her into an area where she got injured and walked through 5 bears, I actually did get a hug. Also, when I got back to the group, Tazz and 2 of her friends showed up. They did the south ridge that day and gave me some beta on the best way to go up the scree field beneath the peak. Radek’s group soon had to go back to the car and Annie and I went up to make camp. (We camped on the small hill left of Wing Lake in this photo.) We got the tent set up quickly (I love that new Black Diamond Lighthouse tent I have) and Radek, Shirley, Haydar and Tom walked through camp on their way out saying goodbye. Soon after, it was just Annie and I and the darkness around us. I brought some heavier foods to make sure she had a good meal. I was going to make my “chicken surprise” which is canned chicken, dehydrated veggies over Spanish rice, a little concoction I made after eating something similar on a mountaineering course I had taken years earlier. What I didn’t count on was the stove conking out on me…. I could get the thing lit but the flame slowly would die. I could get it to meagerly stay on if I shook the fuel canister certain ways. I took it apart and cleared some gunk from it and managed to get it going enough to where the water would almost bubble. Then it died again. And again. So, we ate cold chicken from a can while the mostly warm water tried to cook the rice. Eventually, it did work out to where we ate tepid rice from the pot. Annie was being a very good sport about it but I think I was still riding the Nutella karma at this point. The night was beautiful though, if a bit chilly. The summer was winding down and the air was crisp. We watched satellites cross the sky and then turned in. Thank God the new sleeping pad and sleeping bag we got for her worked well that night. I am not sure how much sleep she actually got, I remember my first night in the woods hearing wolves and lions and other monsters every few seconds and was sure she dealt with a bit of that that night as well. I also know the pain and numbness in her arms from the black fly bites was keeping her awake. We got up in the morning and I had another surprise in store for her. I had brought a civilian version of an MRE for her. These are the tv dinner-like meals that heat themselves on a heating element when you pour water on it. I can vouch for the quality of this one as the blueberry pancakes and bacon actually were kind of tasty. The morning was bright and beautiful and I got my fanny pack ready to go. We had decided that Annie would not climb today due to her knee but she wanted to hike up a ways with me. A few feet into the hike, it was evident that would not work. She was limping quite badly and I had to hurt her feelings a bit by telling her she was “slowing me down.” It was the only way that she would not follow me. In reality, she was not slowing me down that much because truth be -- I ain’t that fast. But she could barely put pressure on the leg and I did not want her to get hurt further. Call it tough love, it really sucked because she gave me a look like I had just slapped a puppy or something. I could see the realization come over her face though that it was the right thing to do and she turned back to hobble to the tent. Man, that sucked. I turned and went up the scree field, taking into account Tazz’s advice to cut back right under a rockband to gain better footing. It was true and I got to the saddle above the scree field and at the base of the south ridge in about 30 minutes. (Looking down from the top of the scree) (Looking up the route from the saddle) Again, I followed Tazz’s advice and stuck to the ridge instead of getting lured into the gully just left of it. It looks like easier ground in the gully but the rock is more solid, the views are better and it is easier going on the ridge. When in doubt, stick to the ridge until the gully and it meet up near the top. (Point where the routes meet) I could see down to the tent and kept waving to Annie although I couldn’t see her anymore and I doubt she could see me. Still having guilt about telling her to turn back, I guess. The route is pretty straight-forward and is cairned near the top. You end up traversing out right onto the ledges on the east face and come to a section of about 15 feet of loose ledgy stuff and near vertical rock. At this point, I was REALLY glad Annie was not there. She would not have liked it and would not have liked me doing it. There is a ledge below you on this section so if you fell, it would probably not mean death but it is definitely 4th class, perhaps 5.0?? Anyway, I did the couple or so moves to scramble up it and was finally on top of Black Peak, the first summiteer of the day. I took some shots and then downclimbed the tricky part, then it was just a nice hike down. The scree section was mostly a nice scree ski and I got back to camp by 10:30 am. I found Annie in the tent avoiding bugs. We filtered some water in the lake and sat snuggling there for a while before packing up. It was the one spot where there was a slight breeze that kept the bugs at bay. We then headed back and what took us about 2 hours to hike in from Heather Pass the day before was about 4 hours going out due to her knee. We just went slow and easy but it was hot that day. I kept taking things out of her pack on break stops and putting them in mine when she wasn’t looking. I bet she only had a 10 pound pack on the way out and didn’t realize it. I just felt like I had tanked on this trip and was just trying to get her back to the car and on to what I knew would be a good rest of the weekend. That boulder field between Lewis Lake and Heather Pass went on forever. When it did end though, it was extra nice because once back on flat ground, her knee did not hurt. She actually was much faster than me on the trail back to the car. It passed without incident, no bears, no injuries, just the constant hum of bugs in our ears. The sight of the car with intact windows was very nice to see a few hours later. I had some Hostess Ding Dongs stashed in there and they tasted extra sweet. From there we went to Winthrop where we had some damn fine pizza. After that we drove to Leavenworth, where I had a very nice hotel room waiting for us at the Bavarian Lodge. The great thing about it was that already she was starting to talk about how beautiful it was by the lake and how she actually enjoyed the food instead of the bugs, bears, bad knee, etc. But wait, it doesn’t end that nicely. Between Cashmere and Winthrop, some knucklehead crossed 4 lanes of traffic in front of us. I had to slam on my breaks to avoid him. I flashed my brights and tried to pass on the left but another car was coming up from behind. The guy now slammed on his brakes in front of me to try to get me to rear-end him. I slammed on mine and he pulled on onto the shoulder. So, I passed him and then he got on my ass with his brights on. This continued on for about 10 miles until we got to Leavenworth. I did not want him knowing where we were going so I drove through to the west end of town and turned to do a loop through the tourist section. He turned with me. I did a loop through and he followed me again. By now, I was wondering if this guy had a gun or something. He was in a pickup wearing a wife-beater shirt and backwards hat looking like something from Jerry Springer. I decided to play it safe and had Annie call 911 on the cell phone. By the time I was on my third loop down the main strip, the cops said they would come and I waited until the last minute to make a left into another hotel lot. The guy went slowly past hanging out of the truck yelling expletives. The cops pulled him over out of town and he gave some story about being from a reservation in Idaho going to see his kid on the coast. They told me I could file against him to take him to court but I sort of assumed the whole thing was over when he went past and got his little tirade out of the way. I would have had to go back to court there so I dropped the whole thing. Besides, we had a great hotel room to get to. Needless to say it is a great place to stay and I highly recommend it. They have a free breakfast buffet every morning with homemade biscuits and gravy, omelets, fresh-squeezed juice, etc. And the rooms are beautiful. We spent the next day in Leavenworth playing tourist. I did not know if Annie would think it was cheesy or nice, seeing that she is from central Germany. But, she said it was very authentic and now wants to move there (although that may have more to do with the 300+ days of sun per year compared to what we have in Portland). She actually brought her dirndl from Germany and wore it around that day. Only problem was that people there thought she was on break from working there instead of being the real deal. No problem though, when she ordered schnitzel or said any German words, even the locals could tell what was authentic.

I've come to the realization that when my wife is with me, plans just have to change. I took her backpacking in one of my favorite places this year, with a mind to summit a peak that I had not done yet. But, due to her limitations we ended up having a leisurely walk through the canyon instead. But, time with her in the mountains is more valuable. Besides, it's all beautiful, not just the summits. And the incident with the truck, I just cannot believe how unpleasant people can be. To imagine that he followed you all that way just to curse you out. He must truly have had nothing to do.

Still what are the odds to have bad bugs in late August, run into 5 bears, have the stove conk out all on her first trip out. At least it is a big laugh in retrospect (although her mom is now mad at me for taking her to the bears). :-) climberska - Sep 14, 2006 8:07 pm - Hasn't voted Black Peak Trip Excellent report. Just a couple of comments: I'd consider it a good day if I saw bears while hiking - not something bad. They are common in the North Cascades area, the Olympics, Mt. Rainier, etc. I do carry bear spray in a mesh pocket that I can reach while walking with my pack. Never had to use it on a bear. If I'm seeing bears that adds to the adventure. On bugs: use 100% DEET. It works. They don't bite - they don't even light - cause you're covered in toxic poison. It doesn't take much - a very small amount can be smeared a long way since it's oily. Thanks for the Lighthouse link. The tent weight is good (3.3 lb) but it doesn't look too aerodyanmic. Stove died? Make a very small wood fire. It will dirty your pot, but it works. I use the MSR XGK stove and it works every time. I'd probably get a whisperlite for use in the lower 48 if I were buying right now. You SHOULD have filed charges against the guy in the truck. Actually I can't say what should REALLY have happened to him, but you can imagine. I've had nearly identical encounters like the one you described. The good lord has blessed us with a generous helping of a-holes. Huh? It says we were created in his image? How's that work? rpc - Sep 14, 2006 8:11 pm - Voted 10/10 Re: Black Peak Trip Stove died? Make a very small wood fire. not allowed at this altitude and unless it's life or death, why? Brian Jenkins - Sep 14, 2006 9:38 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Black Peak Trip Yep, I thought the bears were cool too. And they really were not interested in us, just the blueberries. I had DEET too, she decided on a parka at camp to combat the bugs instead as she has seen how that stuff can melt plastic. I was in a nasty storm on Granite Peak recently and the wide side of the tent was against the winds and it held up great. I would recommend it. They also have a version with the door on the narrow end called the First Lite or something like that too. I know they don't look too aerodynamic but I was surprised how well it did in a nasty wind and hail storm. I found the stove on a more recent trip that I want now. MSR Pocket Rocket. Used it recently on a trip to NH and ME and it was great. Plus, no line to get clogged which I think was my problem on Black Peak. Yeah, I would have liked to press charges but it would mean I would have to prove he did something illegal, tailgating me with brights on, which is what he denied to the cops. So, it would be word against word with no evidence. Ah well, another road rage winner. Thanks for the nice words! Lextalion - Jan 18, 2007 4:25 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Black Peak Trip Brian, The pocket Rocket is an excellent stove. However I have the Primus Omifuel which I like better due to the fact that the stove sits on the ground rather than on top of the canister. Yeah it weighs and cost more. But then again having the options of any type of fuel is so awesome for me. I also like the fact that i can boil 1 liter of water in about 3 minutes @ 9000'. Great trip report. Just took my wife on her first backpack trip in yosemite's lyell canyon area. And also took her up to the base of Mt lyell with 4 miles of trail gaining a little over 3000' of elevation. She's a tough cookie and did it very well, and again I learned to take it slower than I would with one of the guys on a ""PUSH"".

single-day,"Sloan Peak: The ""Matterhorn Of The Cascades""","Corkscrew Route - October 2, 2010 The North Face Of Sloan. Photo By John Gilbert Other Views: South Face West Face East Face At 7835 feet high, Sloan Peak is the 22nd most prominent point in Washington State. Catching a glimpse of Sloan from any angle gives a formidable impression. Fred Beckey has noted in his Cascade Alpine Guide that Sloan Peak has been called the “Matterhorn of the Cascades”. The fact that this massive precipitous mountain was not successfully ascended until 1921 speaks for itself. That’s not to say that climbers didn’t try. Beau And I On The Summit, October 2, 2010 I met Beau for the first time by pure coincidence this last February at the Perry Creek trailhead. We were already familiar with each other from our activity on Summit Post. I could immediately relate to Beau with his passion for peakbagging and affection for the Mountain Loop Highway. In July we met for our first trip together to do Winchester and Larrabee in the North Cascades. Then in September we met again one evening after work to climb White Chuck. Having established a mutual trust and respect for each other, it was time for a real test. One last big climb before the coming snows. One Of Three River Crossings I went to bed at 8:30 pm and lay there thinking about the corkscrew route. A major river crossing which sometimes requires wading up to your thighs, an overgrown trail leading up to exposed slabs, a glacier crossing, steep narrow ledges with cliffs above and below, scrambling up loose dirt and rocks to a maze of route finding issues. I had to sleep because the alarm was set for 2:30 AM but my heart was racing. I felt like I had just drunk a whole pot of coffee and was being chased by wild dogs. There were so many uncertainties. This would be my first time crossing a glacier as a two-person team rather than three. What would the river crossing be like in the dark? This would be Beau’s first time on a glacier. Sleep was slow to come and fitful all night. The Waterfall Crossing During the drive the next morning I had to concentrate to cut sections of cord and melt the ends with a lighter. It took me awhile to remember the knots but eventually I completed the job and Beau had a new set of chest and foot prussiks. The first of three crossings of the North Fork Sauk River was not fun. There was a fallen log to walk across but it was narrow. Looking down into the deep water on either side with the light of my headlamp I imagined the consequences of a fall. We made it across without incident but the next two crossings were equally unfavorable. At one point we had to switch from one log to another to another to get across a huge logjam. Near the bank I had to tightrope walk down a terribly narrow fallen alder, which was suspended over a deep pool. When we were safely on shore Beau named that part of the route “down sloping alder” which had me crack up and release all the nervous tension. I knew he was referring to the down sloping rock of our last climb together on White Chuck. “Down Sloping Alder” then became the slogan of the day. Ascending The Slabs Beyond the river the climber’s path was brushy, and difficult to follow in the dark. Pink ribbons placed on tree branches by other climbers were helpful. We crossed under one major waterfall. After gaining 3000 vertical feet we came into a small valley and had our first view of the summit. A rush of excitement hit us and refueled our motivation to push on. It would be another 3000 of vertical before we got there. The path terminated near a small meadow, at the base of exposed granite slabs. It was amazing to think that at one time the glacier had extended down this far. We scrambled up the slabs below the northeast ridge aiming for the low spot just west of Point 5852. Our First View Of The Glacier Starting Out Across The Glacier On the ridge crest we could see a large portion of the glacier we would be crossing. The crevasses were wide open and clustered in bunches where the ice was passing over convex slopes. Where the slope was concave, the crevasses were closed up and there was no visible threat. These concave areas I considered safe for travel and this was where we would try to weave our way through. Glacier travel in October has some pros and cons. The good thing is that the summers melt has made it so that you can see where all the dangers are. The bad thing is that most of the snow bridges are long gone and the ones that remain and usually narrow and untrustworthy. Beau and I briefly discussed proper glacier travel etiquette and I stressed the point that if you fall into a crevasse or otherwise you should yell “FALLING” so that the other climbers can immediately go into self-arrest. We then roped up, fixing prussik knots, donning helmets, glacier goggles, and our ice axes. Route Finding Issues Beau Crossing The Steep Snow Bridge Our goal was to reach the highest point of the glacier on its southwest corner. Starting out was easy enough. I led up a series of ramps between the clusters of crevasses. Then the going got a little tricky. We were right in the middle of the upper part of the glacier but we had come to an impasse. Here we were boxed in by crevasses on three sides. I tried poking around looking for an alternative way. It seemed like if we could just get up above the big one that was right above us, we could continue our direction of travel. I saw a series of angled snow bridges that looked doable but dangerous. I tried to weigh the hopes of our having enough time to make it to the summit against the safety of retreating and looking for a better way through the maze. I was afraid that a retreat would cost us too much time and we might lose our chance. I decided to try the bridges. The first one was short but the upper lip of the crevasse was higher and very steep. I made it across and told Beau not to step on the thinner middle part of the bridge. The next bridge was very narrow. It was about 9 feet long and only a foot wide in the middle. Looking down, I could see a fall here would be at least 35 feet. Since we were in a narrow section located between two different crevasses, if I went in here, I would pendulum swing a long way before Beau could stop my fall. I didn’t like it. I told Beau to turn back. We would have to find another way. In The Maze Of Crevasses Exposure On The Ledges For the next 45 minutes we zigzagged back and forth trying to find a way through the maze. Some route descriptions suggested traversing the upper edge of the glacier but I was going on the advice of a friend who had climbed Sloan recently and suggested cutting across about “two thirds of the way up”. I used my GPS to make digital tracks so we could follow our same route on the descent. Finally, at the southwest corner of the glacier, we stepped back onto solid rock. We quickly untied and left our rope, harnesses and axes in a heap. Exposure In The Dirt Gully Above The Dirt Gully Beyond the glacier the route turns onto the south face and follows a series of high ledges perched precipitously over 400 foot cliffs. This section of the corkscrew route is semi-famous among the local hiking culture. The boot path here is impressive in it’s placement and exposure but it seemed easy to us after our difficulty on the glacier. Fairly soon we had a good perspective looking up at the remainder of the peak, it's sheer south face. Pushing on we turned another corner and found that we were now on the west face, overlooking the Puget Sound, which was covered with a sea of clouds. Beyond the clouds the entire Olympic Range was visible. Beau began spouting out expressions of disbelief and amazement at what we were seeing. I had to admit, we weren’t even on the summit yet, but already these were the best views from any peak I had ever seen. Nearing The Summit The Summit Ridge The path ended at the base of a steep gully filled with loose stones and dirt. The rock in the fissure was of a different composition and was eroding much faster than the surrounding rocks. We scrambled up the gully hugging the left wall, which offered more handholds. At the top of the gully we turned left bearing north for our final approach of the summit. We were getting close. I could feel it. Now the route became harder to decipher. Where there was dirt, multiple faint paths were less convincing. Where there was rock, we did a lot of scrambling but none of it overly challenging. One move required holding onto a wall of rock while sidestepping a ledge about 10 inches wide, with a long drop behind. Eventually we ended up on giant talus and an exposed ridge top. Then I saw the summit. It was only 30 feet away now. SLOAN PEAK! I could not believe it. How many times had I viewed this monster from every angle on the surrounding smaller peaks? How many times had I thought to myself that it was probably outside my range of abilities? And there it was right in front of me. The highest point. I could reach out and touch it. I did. I followed the ridge crest which was a complete drop on the east side, 450 feet straight down to the glacier. Exercising some care I pulled myself up the last rock and stood on top. Beau was right behind me. The view from the summit of Sloan Peak Full Size We celebrated our summit with food and re-hydration salts. We could see all the way from Mount Baker up north to Glacier Peak in the east to Mount Adams down south. I told Beau that this had been one of the best climbs of my life, a true favorite right in league with Kilimajaro and Pico de Orizaba. To our dismay, we discovered that even though we had each started with more than 3 liters of water, we were down to about a half a cup. It was surprisingly hot for October, but there was a trickle down below the glacier and thankfully Beau had carried a filter. We could make it that far. Beau Enters The Gully The Narrow Ledge Above Cliffs Having started a 6:05 AM it was now 2:00 PM and the sun would be setting in roughly 5 hours. We were reluctant to leave such a splendid summit but it was the responsible thing to do. We scrambled down and followed the ledges back round to the far side of the mountain and the glacier. I was longing for the assurance that awaited us on the far side. If we could cross this mass of broken ice one more time, then surely no substantial malady could threaten us. I switched my GPS back on and we followed our digital tracks back through the labyrinth. The crossing was shorter and less eventful than the first time. We were about 100 feet from the edge of the glacier when I heard a sickening noise that turned my stomach. It had been a horrible whoomfing noise from underneath the snow somewhere nearby, the sound of stuff falling away. I froze and turned around asking Beau if he had heard it. He could see from the look on my face that I was concerned. He hadn't heard it, so maybe I had imagined it? We continued on, getting closer to the edge. Then I heard it again, twice. This time Beau heard it too. It's a god-awful sound to hear when you're crossing a glacier. Thankfully we made it to the rocks without any ground giving away. Descending The Glacier Descending The Glacier We refilled our water at the trickle and moved on down the slabs knowing that daylight would soon be leaving us. We made it past the meadow and into the timber before the dark closed in. I realized that the fall of night marked our moving time to be about 13 hours. It was fully dark when we reached the river crossings. I noticed that the water level had risen and some of the logs were now partially suspended and floating unstably. To make things more spicy the “down-sloping alder” over the deep pool now sagged considerably when any weight was placed upon it. There was no other way across. We had crossed those logs in the dark that morning and now it was time to cross them in the dark a second time. Maybe it was a good thing that we couldn’t fully see the rushing water below us. Neither of us took a spill. In fact after crossing so much rugged terrain, we hadn’t had a single fall all day. Back at the truck, it felt good to sit down after 14 hours on our feet. It felt good to take the boots off. Descending The Slabs Fall Colors I’d like to say thanks to Beau for doing some hair-raising driving that night in his exhausted state and thanks also for carrying that water filter. I'd also like to thank Josh Lewis for loaning us his lightweight glacier rope.

Actually I've spent many nights camping on glaciers. Usually you hear the cracking and creaking noises of the ice moving and splitting. On the other had, the sound of seracs falling down is loud and violent. This sound was softer and almost sounded like the noise they tell you to watch out for with weak layers and slab avalanches. Obviously at this time of year it was neither of those things. It just sounded like bug hunks of snow detaching and falling away into some cavity below. lcarreau - Oct 6, 2010 4:32 pm - Voted 10/10 Re: Great teamwork, guys..

single-day,Shuksan In A Day,"Introduction The Northeast Face, 2010 The East Face, 2011 Shuksan is an amazingly complex peak. The summit block towers over 9 separately named glaciers (6 if you don't count upper, lower, east, west divisions) and is commonly referred to as ""the pyramid"". Shuksan is the fifth highest non-volcanic mountain in Washington State. I have heard claims that it is also the most photographed mountain in the world, even more than the Matterhorn or Cerro Torre. At first I didn't believe it, but then after seeing it in countless hotel rooms in Europe and North America, painted on the side of a building in east Africa, and posted above an ice-cream parlor in southwest Bolivia, I started to believe. The North Face, 2007 My Shadow And Alpenglow On The Mountain, 2010 For years I have felt certain that my mountaineering obsession would one day draw me to this mountain, but for some reason I didn't feel the acute urgency that I sometimes contract with other mountains. Then this July, I climbed Olympus and Bonanza within a 6 day stretch, both of which involve massive elevation gain, glacier crossings, and rock climbing. After those climbs, I felt a new confidence in my own abilities. Shuksan came to the forefront of my mind. Although most parties take 2 to 3 days on the Sulfide Glacier route, I wanted to make a one-day ascent. This would require a very strong team. For a few weeks I discussed the idea with my friends Matt and Colleen. We were all agreed and keen to give it our best shot. We waited for an ideal weather window. Shuksan In Fall, 2006 Shuksan In Winter, 2007 Friday July 22, 2011Sunny skies predicted in the forecast. After work, we drove to the trailhead at 2400 feet, and set our alarms for 1:00 am. I put my sleeping bag on the ground next to the car and slept for a couple of hours. Saturday July 23, 2011 When I got up, I scarffed down a quick breakfast. By 1:35 am, we were moving along the trail with our headlamps, crossing streams in the dark. Eventually we rose above the snow line and the trail disappeared. It was harder to follow the route through the snow in dense forest. Organic debris from the trees made boot tracks harder to follow in the dark. (I later found out that a search and rescue operation was launched the same day to find a lost climber on this section of the trail). With paper maps and two GPS devices we were able to find our way to the top of Shannon Ridge. We stumbled upon a campsite where a disgruntled man, half hanging out of his tent, told us ""you want to go that way"" before turning over and going back to sleep. Mount Baker Before Dawn Mount Baker After Dawn On the ridge crest the trees thinned out and soon we were on open snow. Shannon Ridge was looming large in front of us, but there wasn't enough light to make out any details. We followed old boot tracks up to a pass and crossed through cliff bands to the east side of the ridge, passing more tents as we went. When we reached 5500 feet I noticed the sky to the east was growing brighter. It would just be another hour or so until sunrise. We could see a pink halo tracing the horizon as solar rays illuminated the atmosphere. To the west I could see Mount Baker. I used my ice axe as a tripod in the snow to take some long exposures. Then the first rays of light hit the volcano and it turned pink. I was the first one to notice it and I made a bunch of obnoxious excited noises. Matt and Colleen climbed up to my vantage point to see what all the fuss was about. Nearing The Glacier Scenic Camp Spot We continued to climb on snow, as near to the ridge crest as the cliffs and rock formations allowed. We were now on the edge of the massive Sulfide Glacier. To cross the glacier safely and head straight for the summit pyramid would necessitate roping up. But that was not our plan. I have several friends who had assured me that if you contour the far left edge of the glacier, there is no danger of a crevasse fall. These friends of mine have literally thousands of ascents worth of experience and one of them has climbed Shuksan 5 times, so I trusted their advice. Our route was not as direct as the standard Sulfide crossing, but it would be faster without taking the time to rope up. The Summit Pyramid And Crevasses Climbing Steep Snow Just before the sun hit the snow, we passed an amazing camp site. Two tents stood erected in the center of four rock pinnacles which jutted out of the ridge at different angles, resembling the petals of an opening flower. As a backdrop, the predawn horizon was still shining pink. I swore to myself that if I ever climbed Shuksan a second time, I would bring my tent and pitch it right there. We climbed up through a thin layer of clouds and then the sunlight touched down around us turning the snow yellow and the shaded areas blue. We could see the pyramid now, standing tall above the glacier. It looked impossibly steep, but I reminded myself that this was an optical illusion, caused by looking directly at a steep slope. We could see that most of the standard scramble route up the central gully on the south face was still filled in with snow. Unusually cold and wet weather in Washington this year has made many of our climbing routes at least one month behind schedule for normal melted-out conditions. The Objective The Pyramid We reached the base of the pyramid and were careful to traverse over to the right side so we could get around the bergschrund that was partly open. Having passed so many tents, we couldn't help but wonder where everyone else was. For as far as we could see, there was no one on the glacier coming up behind us. What happened to good old-fashioned alpine starts? We climbed up the base of the central gully following the steps that were already kicked in. The slope now exceeded 60 degrees. The whole south face of the pyramid was still in shadow and the snow was as hard as ice. It was frozen so hard that we couldn't even jam our ice axes through the crust layer. There was no choice but to seek out the holes where others had previously placed their axes. But in some places, no such holes were available. In those spots we swung our axes like ice-tools, jamming the picks in as deep as we could for security. Climbing The Base Of The Pyramid On The Rock Rib The slope grew steeper again and the steps ended at a rock rib. We scrambled up the rib and our crampons screeched and skidded on the rocks. On the other side of the rib the steps continued on icy snow. We were now about half way up the pyramid. I could feel that the air was thinner here. I usually notice altitude somewhere between 8000 and 9000 feet as a shortness of breath and a slight dizziness that comes with exertion. The slope was growing steeper, approaching 70 degrees. We had to climb through one bottle-neck where the snow was only a foot wide, with rock ribs on either side. The snow was thin and we had to exercise extreme caution. Above The Rock Rib Above I could see the remainder of the central gully up to the left. There were no steps going that way. Instead they turned to the right and ended on the southeast ridge of the pyramid. We were still in shade and the snow was like concrete. To climb the gully we would have to rely only on the front points of our crampons. Without proper ice-tools it was not a safe option. But the southeast ridge? That route was said to be anywhere from YDS 5.4 to 5.6 and extremely exposed. It was recommended to bring your rock shoes if attempting that route and nobody in our group had anticipated we would need them. Exposure In The Bottleneck We climbed up off of the snow and scrambled a short way before coming to a near vertical wall, 35 feet high. Matt scouted ahead along a small ledge which looked like it might go around the wall on the east face of the pyramid. The drop behind him was 1000 feet down to the Crystal Glacier. He came back and told us it was no good. I could tell from the tone in his voice that I didn't want to investigate it myself. I put my pack down so that I could climb up the base of the wall and see if there was any way to protect it. I was hoping to find a horn or a crack or just anything. The rock was all down-sloping without any major features. You would have to be pretty creative to set an anchor on this wall. 10 feet up the wall I could see what lay ahead and I didn't like it. A slip there would be fatal. I down-climbed back to the group. Colleen and Matt had to tell me where to put my feet as I couldn't see anything below an overhang. At The Base Of The Wall We talked about what we should do. Colleen's GPS was reading 9000 feet, just 130 shy of the summit. It seemed we had 3 options. The first option was for one of us climb this wall unprotected and see if there was anything above it that would serve as a belay station. I asked if either of them felt bold enough to do that since they both have a lot more rock climbing experience than me. After all, this was only my third time on rock. Neither of them liked the looks of it. Matt was worried about what he might find above the wall. What if he got up there and there was no place to set up a belay or rappel? It was a valid point. Option number two was that we rappel back down to the gully and try to follow the steep exposed snow up to the summit or over to the southwest ridge which didn't look any better. But that wouldn't be safe until the snow had been in the sun long enough to soften up, a matter of several hours. Our last choice would be to turn around. I certainly didn't want to do that. There wasn't a cloud in the sky and it was still early morning. ""The hell with it"", I thought, we can sit here and wait if that's what we have to do. Climbing The Wall But then we heard voices below us. There was another party coming up. We waited to see what they would do. I felt a little embarrassed to be sitting around at 9000 feet, unsure of our next step. The two young men appeared and climbed right past us, unprotected all the way up the wall. We asked them if they could see any anchor points near the top and they said yes. Excellent! We wouldn't have to wait for the snow after all. Matt climbed up unprotected following the same line as the other guys. Next, Colleen climbed up with a belay, and I went last. We all left our packs and crampons at the base of the wall. I scrambled a little higher and was surprised to see that the summit was not an exact point as it appears from afar but an elongated ridge with a couple of high points. We went to the highest one which was still shrouded in snow. I could now see many parties down on the Sulfide Glacier approaching the pyramid. I smiled to myself. It's about time those lazy bums got moving. Climbing Up To The Summit I looked at Mount Baker and remembered how small Shuksan had seemed from that summit, even though Baker is only 1300 feet higher. Right below us on the north face was the incredible Hanging Glacier, riddled with enormous crevasses. I stared at Mount Larrabee to the north and recalled fond memories of that climb with my friend Beau. And there was Tomyhoi! Where I met Greg Slayden for the first time when he invited me to join the expedition to South America. To the south were the giant volcanoes, Glacier Peak and Mount Rainier, also memorable climbs. We spent some time trying to guess which ones were Hozomeen and Jack Mountain. Then I spotted Mox Peaks. That sent a chill up my spine. Many climbers say the Mox grouping is the most dangerous on the Washington Top 100 . Point 8501, also known as ""Hardest Mox"" saw its first ascent just three years ago. Colleen Makes The First Rappel The Third Rappel It was time to go down. We wanted to get off the ridge before it was choked with multiple parties. We rappelled down the wall and collected our gear. Two more rappels on snow brought us part way down the gully. Several other parties passed us on the way up. We down-climbed the lower half of the pyramid, facing in. The snow had softened up a little but was not good enough for plunge-stepping. At the base of the pyramid we retraced our steps around the bergschrund and over to the far edge of the glacier. It was early afternoon and the blinding light from the snow was making us hot. The reflection burned the underside of my nose and inside my mouth. Matt ran out of water and then Colleen did as well. Mine was last to go. I filled my hat with snow several times and let the water drip down over my head and body, soaking my clothes. I've learned that this can lower body temperature and slow sweat production when drinking water is scarce. Down-Climbing There were a number of nice glissade slopes on the way back to Shannon Ridge. I made full use of that. I remembered to retrieve my trail runner shoes at the pass but unfortunately I blew right past my water filter which I had stashed next to the last stream in the woods. Matt and Colleen had to wait for me as I climbed back up to find it. Back in the parking lot, we ate food for an hour and then laid back down on the ground for a second night on the dirt. After 15 miles and nearly 16 hours of climbing, we were so tired. We didn't feel like driving anywhere. From the very beginning, I suspected this would be the case. But who cares! We climbed Shuksan in a day. And honestly, I'm more content sleeping outside in the forest than I am in my own bed.

multi-day,"Liberty Ridge, a memorable climb","Late Season Fools on Liberty RidgeI feel we lucked out at every turn on this mountain. We stood beneath melting serracs, crossed soft snow bridges, escaped avalanches, evaded rock falls, found alternate routes over the bergshrund, endured foul weather and foiled hoards of mice. We didn’t survive because we were wise or great mountaineers; we were just plain lucky. I have every respect for the formidable Mount Rainier. Why she let these late season fools walk away without a scratch is a mystery to me even to this day. A Dreadful lower ridge From left, Steve, Dick, Marc Bivy behind Thumb Rock It felt like it was hours that we were struggling up extremely loose and steep dry ground. I had expected Liberty Ridge to be frozen solid or at least to have hard snow on it. So where was all the snow and ice? For a while every step started a rock avalanche. I was trying to stay a couple hundred feet in front but not in direct fall-line from my climbing partners, Steve and Dick. Whose idea was this anyway? I was asking myself. Well, doing Mt. Ranier was mine, doing Liberty Ridge was Steve’s, and Dick? He always came along, never said much, was predictably late, consistently disorganized, and always ended up shining on the climb. I saw a rock about 2 x 3 feet in size. “That must be big enough to stand on and rest,” I thought to myself. I made my way to it and stood on it. “ Ah, that feels good.” It took only seconds before the rock started to move. I slid down a few feet with it and quickly fell to the side and stopped. The rock, however, didn’t. I yelled down, “Rock!” I couldn’t see Dick, but Steve looked up for a second and looked down again. I yelled, “BIG Rock, guys!” Steve disappeared too. The rock avalanche was sizable and headed directly toward them. I looked in their direction and prayed. When the slide—more like a trundle—stopped, I yelled down, “Are you guys okay?” “Yeah!” someone yelled back. I thought to myself, “I could have killed my two best friends.” The Approach Two weeks later was the 4th of July long weekend. The three of us rushed to rent a car at the Seattle Airport and get under way. When we stopped at the ranger station to pick up a permit, we were warned that a storm was coming in three days. He also told us that they had rescued two climbers from Liberty ridge two days earlier. Apparently one of them had been hit on the face by a rock. Dick said, “You know what that means, guys. We have to hurry!” By 3:00 p.m. we were hiking up the trail. It didn’t take long before we could see the entire north face of Mt. Ranier and Liberty Ridge itself. A friend of mine who had done the route a month earlier had commented, “The first time you recognize Liberty Ridge you will want to turn around and go home. Don’t be discouraged. It’s not as steep as it appears.” The approach to Carbon Glacier went pretty smoothly. We camped close to its edge and watched the sunset do its afternoon dance on the north face of Rainier. I’m not sure if I got any sleep that night; I couldn’t wait to get started early in the morning. If it had been up to me, we would have started pre-dawn before snowbridges got too soft to cross. Getting Dick and Steve out of their bags, however, was a challenge. The Glacier It took some coaxing and cajoling to get my buddies going. Dick muttered, “This feels more like work than vacation.” Carbon Glacier was fully sunlit when we came to the first seracs. They were leaning and melting like a faucet that was left on. This was when we made our next foolish mistake by filling our water bottles. I guess the mountain gods were on our side to keep the seracs from rolling on top of us and to keep the snow bridges from collapsing under our feet. We made fast progress toward the base of Liberty Ridge with our eyes scanning for any snow gullies. None were to be found. The most solid rock section was a broken up steep step about forty feet in height. I pointed, “That’s our route, but we can’t use a rope.” I was afraid a rock would break off and hit the rope, taking me down with it into the gaping mouth of a crevasse below. Willis Wall looming above The Ridge Rock Step Thumb RockThe rock step turned out to be easier than I had expected. I was the first to arrive on the ridge proper. Dick was next, but when he showed up on top, he was tied into one of our two ropes. He said he wanted to belay Steve. “Okay, Steve. Climb!” Dick shouted down. I started working my way further up the ridge. Within minutes I heard a loud crash! I yelled down, “Are you guys okay?” Steve had pulled a large loose rock off the rocky section, but he was okay. We moved carefully and methodically. I was praying for some snow and ice. I was tired of finding my way through steep and loose scree. A few hundred feet below Thumb Rock, our bivy site and objective for the day, I came across the first hard snow. I took out the rope, flaked it out on a rock, and quickly put on my crampons. By now Dick was there. I handed the rope to him and asked him to feed it out. In what seemed less than an hour, we were all on the base of Thumb Rock. Liberty Wall Thumb Rock is a 300 foot formation made of broken volcanic rock. Just opposite of Thumb Rock there is another loose formation, and in between the two there is barely enough room for two small tents. Dick and Steve shared a very small tent; I had a tarp that could double up as a tent. During dinner we heard a loud crack. An avalanche plumetted down Liberty Wall only a few hundred feet away. Around ten o’clock at night it rained for a short time. I worried obsessively that a rock would break off Thumb Rock and land on us. My fears came to be realized in the middle of the night when I heard another loud crack. It was a rock about a foot long that broke off the other formation and rolled to within feet of our bivy site. Sheer luck. I am predictably bad at getting sleep the first two nights in mountains. The rock fall didn’t make it any easier to get any shut eye. In any event, morning dawned and Dick, Steve and I had to get going. We had 4,000 feet of steep snow and ice to climb. The Shooting Gallery It had rained on us for a short time the night before. Rain at 10,000 feet? I thought to myself. This cannot be a very good sign. In the morning one of the first things I noticed was hearing the sound of running water. By 8:00 a.m. it sounded like thousands of creeks running down Willis Wall to our left. Within a few hundred feet we came to what I called “The Shooting Gallery.” We had to go through a rocky formation that looked like a gun sight. Countless smaller rocks had come down the gun sight and scarred the steep slopes below. We scanned with our eyes for any possible alternate way to go up. None seemed any better. Just above Shooting Gallery Dick started to lead, heading straight up. Small avalanches of sand and pebbles poured unrelentingly down the middle of of the gun sight. Dick hadn’t reached the worst part yet when we saw some bigger pieces coming through the notch. One piece was noticeably larger than the rest. It missed Dick and came directly toward me. I didn’t want to jump out of the way until it got closer. I was tied with a 4-foot leash to my ice axe that was buried in the snow. I had to be sure which way to jump. By now the rock had picked up considerable speed and was tumbling down toward my legs. At the last second I jumped to my right. The rock hit my ice axe’s adze and bounced, missing me by two feet. “Let’s hurry up and go through this, guys!” I yelled. Upper Ridge Once we passed the Black Pyramid, we could not hear the running water anymore. The temperature dropped quickly and we put on extra layers of clothes. From this point on we did not see any more rock falls. The ridge seemed pretty consistent at 40-45 degrees with steeper sections peppered in mostly hard snow. Not much different from any other volcano: the higher you climb the less obvious the summit’s location. Still, we figured that as long as we were going up, we should be getting closer to the top. I worried about the infamous bergshrund that I knew we had to overcome. But where was it? We finally reached a vertical section about 15 feet. No, this was not the shrund. There were no crevasses on either side, and it didn’t look like the photos I had seen. The three of us were tired. Progress slowed down considerably. And then I saw it: bergshrund ahead. Upper Willis Wall Approaching Storm Getting Lucky Dick leading the first step Ptarmigan RidgeA gaping crack that seemed endless was a few hundred feet ahead. My eyes were panning to the right and left for the narrowest part of the bergshrund. Way to the left there seemed to be a section that I couldn’t make out. Hoping that it might be a bridge, I headed that way. The closer I got, the more promising the prospect. When we finally got close enough, I saw that a huge avalanche had covered part of the main bergshrund. I breathed a sigh of relief and told Dick who was just behind me, “That’s it, Dick!” We climbed on to the avalanche debris. Summit Bivouac Melting snow near the summit of Liberty CapThe sun was dropping down toward the horizon like a rock. We had just finished a long, very steep section of avalanche debris and the slope kicked back to about 40 degrees again. We were too busy to pay much attention to a sea of clouds that had begun to cover the entire landscape below our feet. Steve was tired and suggested that we dig a hole and stay there for the night. I objected to that strongly: if the storm actually hits, we needed to be closer to the top so we could head down the opposite side of the mountain. Liberty Ridge was too steep and dangerous to contemplate using it as an escape route. Dick agreed and got in front to lead another vertical step. Steve followed using his headlamp. Then it was my turn to climb. I asked Dick and Steve to turn off their headlamps so that I could climb with what little light was coming from the horizon. Then I was on top! Soon we were all on top of Liberty Ridge! The ground became nearly perfectly flat. We melted snow for drinking and made hot water bottles for our sleeping bags. There was little energy left for conversation after our long, hard day. There on top of the ridge we rested our beaten bodies for the night. Summit of Liberty Cap, Mount Rainier, Descent down Emmons Glacier Summit of Liberty Cap. The dirt patch visible behind us is the summit of Mount Rainier. Summit of Rainier in full condition When we crawled into our bags the night before we didn’t know exactly how far we were from the top. I was the first one out of my bag in the morning. Looking up I realized we were only a couple of hundred feet from the summit cone of Liberty Cap. Hurriedly I put on my crampons and grabbed my pack heading for the summit. Steve and Dick stuck their heads out of their tent and gave me dirty looks for being so chipper. “See you on top, boys!” I shouted obnoxiously. When I got to the top I realized that the entire mountain—except for the two summits—was socked in. It didn’t take long for Dick and Steve to show up on top. After taking a few summit shots, we proceeded to drop down about 400 feet to the saddle between the Liberty Cap and Columbia Crest. Another 800 feet of easy hiking put us all on top of Mount Rainier. Getting Lucky again By the time we reached the main summit of Mt. Rainier, the storm was upon us in its full fury. We scrambled to take a few summit photos, then turned to the task of descent. Our original plan was to find Saint Elmo’s Pass which would lead us back to the north side of the mountain. But with the storm and cloud cover, we decided that finding the pass would be nearly impossible. Fortunately I had located a trail of footprints heading down toward the east side of the mountain. It would take us down to Emmons Glacier. We headed down. By the time we reached the treeline, darkness was upon us. We were forced to spend another night on the mountain. Although it rained most of the night, we were so tired that nothing kept us from sleeping—not even being attacked by hundreds of persistent mice trying to burrow into our sleeping bags with us. In the morning we headed down the trail in an on-and-off rain. We ran into two climbers going up the mountain who were planning to approach Liberty Ridge via St. Elmo’s Pass. I told them about rain on our Thumb Rock bivouac sight, and the rock falls that had nearly finished me. Prudently they decided to cancel their climb and go back down with us. They also offered to take one of us to the north side parking lot to get our car. Steve volunteered to go. Lucky again, since we had no other way to get to our car parked 60 miles away. Call me lucky; call me superstitious. I think Mount Rainier let us “Three Late Season Fools” off the hook too easily. Or, may be she was touched by the love we had for her.

multi-day,It doesn't Get Much Better than this: 4 Days on Mount Logan,"Introduction ""I see my path, but I don't know where it leads. Not knowing where I'm going is what inspires me to travel it."" -Rosalia de Castro ""Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover."" -Mark Twain It is mountains like this that makes mountaineering such an exciting part of my life. When I heard that I had an opportunity to climb Mount Logan, I instantly knew that this was something special. My family and friends were telling me that they had never known anyone who wanted to go on as many adventures as me. My feet were still blister from all the climbing I had done during July, but when offered a great opportunity, there is no way that I can decline. After all this is my passion. The weather had not gotten any better after Jack Mountain which is usual for the state of Washington. Even after halting the climbing date for Mount Logan, there was a point which we had to take a chance, hope for the best and go for it. This turned out to be a great decision. Yem came over to my house late in the day in order to get to the trailhead by night and get a early start for the hike though the Thunder Creek Valley. I had never packed so much food for a single trip before, but knew it would be necessary. Day 1: Hiking through the Thunder Creek Valley Ruby Mountain with Clouds In the morning it was a cloudy day with some views of the mountains we could see through the trees. We started hiking from the Colonial Creek Trailhead at 6:45 a.m. along the Thunder Creek Trail. We were in for a 15 mile day with heavy backpacks, but at least much of the terrain was relatively flat. Along the way we crossed over Thunder Creek using the bridge provided (the creek is like a river) and saw many wild flowers along the way. Unfortunately we did not see many mountains because there would either be trees in the way or there would be too much cloud cover. The one bad thing about the thunder creek hike is that many of the miles feel the same with traveling through the same woods mile after mile. But at least I'm in the mountains with good company, fresh air, and am on a great adventure. Foresty Spot Lights Purple Flower White Flowers Walking through the Forest One of the Many Creeks Along the way there were many creeks which I had to be careful for because I was wearing approach shoes that get wet easy, and I could not afford to make my blisters any worse than they were for this trip. We did take a few breaks along the way, although setting down the pack was pleasant on my shoulders, I was not a fan of all the mosquitoes when trying to get a bite to eat or drink. But it's to be expected during the month of July in the mountains. Tricouni Peak with Clouds It's neat to think that during the month of July I been in the mountains so often that it felt completely normal for me, almost as if it was a life style. Most people when making it to the top of a mountain are in a hurry to go back home and go about there daily lives, for me it's more the opposite. I find the life style of the city for me to be too dull and unattractive. Although I will admit after a while I do at times miss my family and friends, so I try not to be constantly in the mountains the entire summer, although perhaps most of the time. Log Crossing Thunder Valley Waterfall on Tricouni Peak Nice Log Crossing Half Way to Parks Creek Pass After reaching the part of the trail called ""Junction"", we are at the half way point to Parks Creek Pass. From here we travel a little ways further only to reach a part of the trail which we have to loose a 1,000 feet of elevation. The thought that comes to mind is ""wow, won't this be fun on the way back out"". After going down to the valley floor we soon come to our camp site which is called Skagit Queen. From here we enjoy a nice dinner of hot chocolate, tea, salami, cheese, and top romen. That night I slept very good after about 15 or so miles of travel. Skagit Queen Camp Day 2: Traveling into Snowy Lands Deer Near our Camp In the morning I woke up to a deer traveling around our tent as well as a squirrel running away as I got up. By the end of the previous day it had actually looked as though it would clear up, but over night it had gotten cloudy again. We got a late start at about 10:15 a.m. in the morning, the trail was in good condition although there was a few trees in the trail that we had to go over. While switch backing along the trail we came across an old mining house as well as a old pine line that went through many of the switch backs. As we got further in the valley we came across our first encounter of snow, this was a ideal place to leave the shoes behind and swap to climbing boots. There were many places where avalanche debris was covering the trail, although some dry patches of trail. Mushrooms on the Tree Avalanche Debris After this the valley vegetation increased dramatically making the environment look semi jungle like. From here we came across the thunder creek crossing, I was not in favor for getting my feet wet. We went a little ways back and found a nice log crossing, we had to do the old fashion sit and edge our way across. At one point my shorts got caught on it which slightly ripped them, but it was better than not using the log. The easy way across Mount Logan's Towering False Summit Park Creek Pass Now we were close to the Thunder Basin Stock Camp, we took a nice break and had to make a decision whether to go all the way to Parks Creek Pass or take a short cut and go straight up the mountain. We finally decided to take the more direct route and follow along the right side of the towering false summit (Point 8,000). Going into the Brush At first it was a little brushy entering into the woods, but as soon as we got onto the lower slope of Mount Logan, things became much nicer... or at least for the first few hundred feet. As we climbed up we used veggie belays and such to help keep us stable on the slope. Sometimes the ice axe would get caught, but even worse was when one of my backpack straps would get caught which I would have to maintain balance until I got it untangled. As we climbed higher we came across mini cliff bands and steep sections that made traveling tedious, it got to the point where I started to wonder if we would reach a point where we could not climb any higher. Crawling through a Tree After doing a bit of navigation we managed to get through without anything too dangerous. We went up a little ways further to the left and now where out of the woods and nearing the Fremount basin. Finally into a Clearing Rolling Mist On the Upper Snowfield Entering the Basin Evening on Logan Marsh Marigold Dark Sky Rising Clouds Primus Peak The clouds all around were getting darker which did not seem like a sign of the weather getting better any time soon. From here we hiked up the basin to a flat area around 8,000 feet high. As I broke trail it began to rain a little, further up the winds were picking up and it became colder. Keep in mind I was still in a t-shirt and shorts, but now I was on a slope that was a little steep to be taking off my pack, plus we were almost to our destination of the day. As the wind was blowing it suddenly changed to snow which my arms and legs were getting quite cold by this point. Once I got to the top of the hill I had to put on everything that I had to regain warmth. I had a hard time putting on my gear because my hands were becoming numb and I had to be careful about clothes blowing away. A moment later we found a flat spot which was great for setting up camp. Snowing on the Tent After stomping around for a while on the snow to make a flat spot for the tent, Yem started up cooking for dinner. Looking all around I couldn't help but feel as though I was in a winter wonderland. The sky was getting dark, and the fog continuously would pour in from the valley below. Only for a split second could we faintly made out Mount Logan through the clouds, it then went back to the same old cloudy views. After dinner we finally went into the tent to make attempts to sleep that did not come easy. As we talked I could see the flashing of lightning above, I was a bit worried but they seemed distant. After a while we finally fell asleep. Day 3: Going for the SummitWaking up early in the morning the weather had not improved one bit, we decided that it would be best to wait out the storm before making a summit bid, even if that meant crossing the glacier late in the day. I rolled around a bit having a hard time going back to sleep only to realize that my air mattress was popped which is why I could feel a lump in my back. But it was still better than being at home. A few hours later I woke up seeing that it looked bright outside the tent, for a moment I was excited. When looking outside it was once again just bright fog with a few minor clearings from time to time. Eventually we got out of the tent when I spotted a clearing in the sky which raised hopes for some views. For about 30 or so seconds Mount Logan came into view which I frantically took some photos of the view. Light Dusting of Snow on Logan Temporary View of Mount Logan's Summit And then back to the same old cloudy view. After watching the clouds for an hour, Yem and I noticed there was a pattern with how the clouds would blow in. First you would see a few holes, then a view of a few peaks, and then back to being socked in. Then it would repeat itself again. The Boston Glacier through the Fog Looking at my food supplies I realize that we have to summit today, plus I had another adventure lined up as soon as I got off this mountain. The mountain itself had not come back into view, so in a sense I was taking two risks if we went for it. 1: Not being able to see exactly where we need to go. 2: We risked not getting the incredible view of Logan from the summit. At the end of one of the clearings we finally decided that it was worth a shot, so we packed up our climbing gear, put on our harnesses, and made way for the summit. It was 3 p.m. when we finally left camp. I was in lead which now all I could see was the lower face of Mount Logan with clouds all around and my partner. I knew from a earlier clearing that there were two gullies, which I went for the first one on the right assuming that it was the cross over spot for the ridge. After traveling up a snow slope we reached the bottom of it, it looked like class 4+ all the way up with a lot of exposure. Yem and I were not pleased with how it looked, we even saw a foot print in the dirt which seemed like evidence that it might be the route. ""Hang on a second, perhaps there is another way"" Yem finally announced. I decided to pull out my camera and look at former photographs that I took earlier in the day. Remarkably it helped us figure out where we were, and where we needed to go. After down climbing off of the steep section, Yem suggested that I stay high on the snow ridge. This turned out to be a very good idea. As we travel along the ridge, it felt as through we were constantly going to the right. Almost as if it was endless. It was at this moment that I thought of a quote ""I see my path, but I don't know where it leads. Not knowing where I'm going is what inspires me to travel it"". It was exciting traveling the ridge, faintly through the fog I could see it glowing. Pretty soon I came across what appeared to be a cornice, when deciding to travel on it to my relief it was the hogsback. We were officially on the route again. The Hogsback a Few hours after getting to the base of it (after the fog cleared) From here we climbed over the Hogsback and on to a section where we had to cross over the ridge. We took off our crampons and left our ice axes to save weight. We knew that any snow on the east face would be too treacherous to be traveling on which is what made leaving gear a acceptable choice. Once we crossed over onto the east side of Mount Logan the terrain suddenly became quite rugged, I'll admit that for a few minutes I became a bit nervous. After finding some good scramble spots I became comfortable again, this was perhaps the best class 3-4 terrain I have ever been on. Despite the exposure, the rock was remarkably solid. After making a few careful moves and looking back down, I smiled in excitement. The climb was on. The Section just before Crossing over onto the East Face The First Climbing Section Once past this section it became flat with a bit of exposure. We carefully traversed this spot and came to a snow field. Yem announced that it would be best to stay as much to the left as possible to avoid the snow. From here it looked like we were virtually at the summit. But like many mountains when fog covered, it was a teaser summit. Misty Summits Going around the Snowfield One of the Many Gullies Below Pink Flowers Yem and I had to do a bit of a down climb move to continue along the ridge, but fortunately there was not a whole lot of exposure here. From here there was one last traverse with a scramble ending with more fun moves. We were officially on the summit. I was in awe that we had made it. Down Climb Section Views from the Summit Looking Back at the Summit It was getting late in the day, so we decided to spend only enough time on the summit to have a quick snack and mini celebration. Going down was much easier than I had expected. On our way down we could see clouds rising in fast motion, and soon enough we got a major clearing. Brocken Spectre The False Summit Clearing Up The Ridge through the Clouds Mount Goode through the Clouds The Views to the South This was the moment we had been waiting for all along, the views of mountains kept pouring in through the clouds. It was more beautiful than if it had been clear skies all day. When crossing over the ridge I could see that the Hogsback was glowing brightly with a ultra contrast lighting to it. ""It doesn't get much better than this"" I whispered to myself as I descend onto the slope below. In the Dark Shadows of Mount Logan The Views Below the Mountain Looking Down the Hogs Back Yem heading down the Hogsback Cross over Spot When we Backed Down Tracks going to the Route From here it was a easy descent back to our camp which this time we got to travel on mostly flat terrain due to us being able to see where we were going. At camp Yem boils the water for my top romen, when it finally cooled down I got to enjoy the sunset with glowing peaks with tasty warm food. This in my mind was an example of a moment of perfection in the mountains. We took photos until our hands became too cold from the cool air, and we then went to sleep feeling great from an amazing day. The Views to the Southwest Alpenglow on Mount Logan Clearing Mountains Eldorado with Rising Clouds Sunset over the Clouds Yem watching the Sunset Bright Shining Clouds Sun Setting over Primus Primus Peak with Clouds Fire Across the Sky Primus Peak after Sunset Beautiful Eldorado Peak Alpenglow on Bonanza Peak Evening View from Camp Day 4: The long journey HomeIn the morning I woke up around 5 a.m. Normally when this tired I would go back to sleep, but I very much wanted to see the sunrise. So I put on my boots and scrambled up a few hundred feet to get views of Jack Mountain as well as a few others. Then I went back down to camp to see the rest of the views during the sunrise. Sunrise on Eldorado, Klawatti, and Primus Peak Sunrise on Buckner Mountain Above the Clouds in the Morning Sunrise Colors on Jack Mountain Sunrise on Eldorado Peak Sunrise on Ripsaw Ridge Boston Peak Alpenglow Sahale Mountain Forbidden Peak Primus Peak Morning View of Mount Logan Sunrise on Klawatti Peak Brooker Mountain Boston and Sahale Mountain From here we knew that we had a long day ahead of us with over 20 more miles of traveling left. After breakfast we packed up camp, refilled water at a near by creek and were ready to go. I'll admit the descent was a bit hard on my ankles and knees because of the crampons on the hard snow on steep slopes. Below us were still come lingering clouds in the valley below, ironically now I was wishing for some cloud cover to help made going back a bit cooler. After all there are not a lot of views from the woods even when there is no cloud in the sky. Heading Down the Fremount Basin Going towards Park Creek Pass Eldorado Peak during Late Morning Once we were near the pass, Yem decided to take a short cut down one of the side gullies. This turned out to save us time, although it had an interesting section near the bottom. It was a little bit difficult with crampons on, we had to travel over a tree with a mini water fall that had to be avoided. Looking Down the Mini Waterfall Yem Down Climbing using the Tree Misty Forest Down Below   Snake in the Woods  Hiking Back Up HillFrom here it was a walk down to the basin where Thunder Creek began to form. We took off our crampons here and took a rest. Looking at my food supplies I found that I had a limited amount of food, but enough to make it back home. At first finding the trail was a bit difficult because of all the avalanche debris, but as we got further down the valley we found it. A few miles further down the trail we came to my approach shoes which I was pleased because this meant that I did not have to wear my blistering boots. But at the same time I was disappointed that they were soaking wet from the rain the previous days. To make the trip quicker we ran down some of the down hill sections. Many miles later of traveling through the woods we finally reach the part that we all dreaded. The 1,000 feet of elevation gain. This was certainly one of the hardest parts of the trip, plus the fact that it was hot out did not make things easier. After pressing on for hundreds of feet up the hill, I was becoming quite tired by this point, as well as my shoulders hurting (I know, I sound like a complainer. But I want the audience to know that just because it was the way back doesn't mean it was easy). Cornices across the Valley Jungle Like View Tricouni Peak After another mile or so we reached Junction, from here we decided to cook our last meal of the trip. Unfortunately not only were there lots of mosquitoes, but there were lots of black flies. I kept getting bite marks all over my legs (even a week later they were still itchy). This made it hard to sit in one place during lunch. As soon I was done, I was wanting out of Junction to get away from the bugs. For the next 9 miles we ran down the mountain, I'll admit it was a bit monotonous, but I was still having fun. After more hours of walking through the woods we finally reach the trailhead. ""Finally I can rest"" I announced as I take a bite into a cookie that I had a stash saved up for me for the ride home. As I start to fall asleep I realize ""My adventure is not yet over, tomorrow I have a climb for Vesper Peak, and the next day Mount Rainier"". I smile at the thought that I am having an amazing summer with never ending adventures.

But I plan on going on more trips soon. I would love to go to Yukon, but the passport deal is what is preventing me. As it is I have difficulties paying for my trips (and gear) which I spend just about every ounce of my cash on. But in the future I certainly plan on doing major climbs.

single-day,An 18 Hour Day On Eldorado Peak,"March 6, 2010 First Light on J-burg Inspired by Steph Abegg's recent trip report, EastKing and I started discussing the possibility of heading up to Eldorado ourselves to give the mountain our best shot. Eldorado has been on my to do list for a few years now but I've felt a little trepidation about that famous knife edge finish to the summit. Seeing Steph's photograph of the unusually wide east ridge settled things in my mind. I wanted to climb this peak while the upper reaches were covered in fresh snow. We decided If we got another break in the weather. Eldorado would be our goal. We hoped to do this trip the last weekend in February but with increasing avalanche danger we went to North Chiwaukum and Middle Chiwaukum instead. Fortunately, the following weekend provided the weather we had hoped for and also very low avalanche danger. Leaving my house at 1130pm Friday night, we drove to the trailhead. I knew that most people did Eldorado as a two day climb to break up the 6700+ feet of vertical gain. But I felt confident that with an early enough start, we could do it in a day. There would be six of us making two rope teams of 3 for crossing the Eldorado Glacier and the Inspiration Glacier. Eldorado Creek Drainage Dave, Greg (SP member EastKing), and I met Josh, Mark, and Michael at the trailhead in the middle of the night and were moving through the dense forest by 3 AM. Later I would wish we had started earlier. The first obstacle was crossing the Cascade River. We found the log jam which is the common crossing point but to our dismay we found that it was covered with a thin layer of icy frost. Nobody fell in the river but to keep from slipping we had to use extra care. It has been noted in the past that finding the start of the actual trail is not easy. This is true. I think we were actually bushwhacking for some time before anything like a trail opened up in front of us. The trail, which contours the west side of Eldorado Creek, was steep and difficult to follow in the dark using only our headlamps. This was the third or fourth climb I had done without changing my headlamp batteries so they weren't quite up to par. Upper Eldorado Creek Basin At some point we broke out of the trees and immediately we found ourselves climbing steep crusty snow. The real nightmare about this part of the route was giant talus sprawled about on this steep slope intermixed with half-melted snow. There were wide moats around nearly all the boulder sized talus rocks. This combination of jagged rocks, thin snow formations, and deep crevices was a perfect recipe for a twisted ankle or broken leg. Thankfully it didn't come to that. Higher up we reached slopes that were fully snow covered and predawn light started spilling into the valleys. The most impressive view from this approach was the imposing giant which is Johannesburg Mountain, known locally as J-burg. A summer view of this peak is impressive enough with its many cliffs and hanging glaciers. Seeing it's north face in the winter covered in snow flutings was no less impressive. The sun came up and dramatically changed the colors on J-burg. Getting Tired The East Ridge Reaching the top of the Eldorado Creek drainage we faced an enormous headwall. At this point it would be necessary to climb over the ridge to the west and drop down into the Roush Creek drainage. There were plenty of recent slides visible that had come off of this ridge but none of them looked very big and most had probably happened in the late afternoon, after hours of sunshine. We made it to the ridge top and at this point Dave (SP member) decided to throw in the towel and head back to the car. He had my full sympathy because he had worked a twelve hour day, then without rest he had driven all through the night from his house in Wenatchee to pick us up in Edmonds, 3.5 hours (135 miles), and then from there drove another 3 hours (110 miles) to the trailhead. So on top of all that, the 4000 feet of gain to the ridge top had just taken too much out of him. At this point, rather than having a tired climber descend over some dangerous spots alone, EastKing volunteered to go down with him. It was a difficult choice but a very honorable one. He later told me that Dave took a fall in bad place and could have been injured and in trouble if he had been alone. On The East Ridge The ""Knife Edge"" The remaining four of us dropped down off the ridge and found a nice flat spot to rope up. Although we weren't on the Eldorado Glacier yet, we would be soon enough. Mark (SP member) led for awhile and when he got tired, Josh at the other end of the rope took over. After an hour or so we reached the flat plateau which marked the edge of the Inspiration Glacier which is the third largest in the North Cascades. Now the summit and east ridge were literally in our faces. Looking up at the sun I had my doubts about whether or not we would have time to summit. Nobody had remembered to bring a watch and from the looks of it, it was getting late. We decided to go at least as far as the base of the ridge and see how long that took to get there. Once we were there, without pausing we continued to climb higher and higher. Josh was doing a good job leading but as things iced up in a few spots I recommended that we all take our snowshoes off and this made it much easier. We also untied from the rope since the ridge top was not part of the glacier. The Summit The Summit It took a long time but we made it to the bottom of the ""knife edge"" and found it to be just as wide as Steph's picture had shown. In minutes were all rejoicing on the summit. At number 25, Eldorado is one of Washington highest mountains. We knew that climbing it in a single day and also with early spring snow was something to be proud of. Mark freely admitted that it was the hardest thing he had ever done. I felt very happy to have assisted two 17 year olds to the summit of one of the Cascades most famous peaks. Everyone on the rope had proven their strength and stamina. Now it was time to get down, as fast as safely possible. As much as I regretted it, I sort of became a drill sergeant to keep everyone moving. I put time limits on breaks and constantly reminded everyone to keep up the pace. We made it off the glaciers without incident and thankfully Michael (SP member) offered to carry the rope down which I had carried up. When we crossed over the ridge back into the Eldorado Creek drainage we found that a few hours of shade had formed a new hard crust on the snow. So much for those long glissades we had hoped for. As a consolation prize, neighboring Sahale Mountain was lit up with alpenglow. Dark was fast approaching now. I wanted to get past the nasty steep snowy talus before nightfall. We did not make it in time. The Summit The snow conditions deteriorated to the worst I have ever seen. There was a hard crust on top from the cool night air but below that were several feet of unconsolidated snow which had been softened throughout the day. For awhile it was too steep to wear our snowshoes. Many times I would take a step and then sink in all the way to my waist. When were finally able to put on our snowshoes, we still found ourselves sinking in to our knees. Yuck! Strap failures on the snowshoes caused us to stop for frequent breaks. I tried to remain calm while I thought about the evening I wanted to spend with my girlfriend Sarah slipping away. Among the talus slopes we came to a steep drop -off. Remembering the way we had come up this section I decided it wouldn't be any better to try to find the exact spot. I chose a class three gully with plenty of rocks to hold onto. There was no snow in this gully but it was steep and the rocks were wet and down sloping. I went down first and then held my breath while the other guys came down one at a time. I knew that there was real potential for injury at this point, especially since we were doing it in the dark. I felt real relief when we were all down unscathed and I knew the worst was over when Mark found the trail. Sahale Mountain Alpenglow The rest of the way we did our best to stay on track. When we came to the Cascade River we didn't even bother looking for the log crossing. Wet and exhausted, we just walked through the water, letting it fill our boots. By 9 PM, Dave and Greg at the cars were a welcome sight.

As it should be known I turned back with Dave. Dave was extremely tired due to not sleeping for 24 hours. So at 6250 just before going down the ridge to start the main part of the climb he wisely called it there. I was a little tired and probably would have been the slower person here but could have continued. But my gut here was not feeling so good about Dave going down alone here. He has a ton more experience than I did but conditions below did not look good in the lowest talus field. I was also concerned about the avalanche danger on the mountain slope. To me this was a safety first decision to head back down with mtn.climber. It was a very wise decision for be to stay back. Josh , Mark , and Mike was with Gimpilator, a man I would trust my life with and they all roped up on the climb. I knew that they were in good hands and were one of the few groups that have actually roped one for the glacier travel required to ascend Eldorado. I was also able to give some in the group extra water for there long ascent to the summit. At the lower talus field Dave took tripped and fell to the edge of an 8 foot cliff that probably would not have killed him but would have broke some bones if he fell. Luckily he stopped himself before that fall but if it had been one more foot he would have been injured and without me could have been in a bad situation alone 2000 up on a mountain. At least with me there, there were plenty of options! I wouldn't live with myself if he got injured and I wasn't there to help him! Safety first is my motto and I will live by that no matter what. Summits are always a distant third, even if was Eldorado in peak conditions. gimpilator - Mar 10, 2010 12:08 pm - Hasn't voted Re: What happened with EastKing and Dave Thanks Greg for sharing these details with us.

single-day,Reality Check on Pica Peak,"The beginning of the climb On Pica Peak Fine fall dayA few weeks ago, Fred went up to the Washington Pass area, near the Liberty Bell group, to climb Wallaby Peak and Copper Point, while I was caring for a friend who had had surgery. He spied a nice looking peak that sits between Copper Point and Early Winter Spire. It looked like it might be a good climb with a short approach. According to the Beckey guide, it is Pica Peak (labeled only as 7565 on the USGS quad sheet). Subsequent research also came up with an alternate name of Poster Peak. Its east ridge route is locally known as Blue Buttress and depending on which trip report you read, this is either a fabulous climb or sort of a dog, anywhere from 5.3 to 5.7 and anywhere from 9 to 12 pitches. Great weather was forecast this past weekend and since we are back teaching college, it’s hard to get away for anything long, so we thought to give this climb a shot. Saturday morning just past 7 a.m. we were parked at the hairpin turn east of Washington Pass and headed up the trail. One has to leave the trail early and take a long ascending traverse over talus, boulders, steep trees and heather. It is a bit of a grunt, but 1½ hours later, we were at the base of the climb. For the Cascades, this is a short approach. The climbing goes well although it isn't that great. The number of trees and loose rock further lessen the appeal. We realize that the widely diverging opinions and descriptions of this climb are founded in the many options existing on which way to go. One short section we walked, but overall the climbing was in the low to mid Class 5 range and we alternated leads. The fall About 1 or 2 pitches below the fall - but the scenario pretty much looked like this!About 4 pitches from the summit, Fred led up a slab. He had placed three pieces of protection: a small wired stopper, a sling around a tree and an old Friend in a crack. He was about 70 feet out and complaining that the rock was poor and friable. He had thought to place another piece but no good opportunities existed, so he opted to continue up a bit further and grabbed a large slab of rock. He had hardly touched it when there was a loud crack and the rock seemingly exploded off, knocking Fred backward. Granite weighs about 165 lbs per cubic foot. By Fred’s estimation this slab was 3 feet by 2 feet by 8 inches thick – so about 700 lbs. The next thing I see is Fred, the big rock, and numerous smaller rocks falling toward me. Fred tumbles one way, but the rock continues towards me and I think, “If that hits me I am toast!” I have a death grip on the rope and feel Fred’s weight suddenly wrench on me, but I am also watching the rock, preparing to duck. My dad’s words echo in my head: “Wait until it is close before ducking. You never know which way rocks will go.” The large slab does indeed bounce off to the side and hurtles between me and Fred down the mountain. Smaller, but equally lethal rocks continue on. I am able to dodge most of them. One lands harmlessly on my pack, one grazes my helmet but crams it down on my head pretty hard. My helmet is left with a pretty good gouge in it. Fred remembers the crack when the rock let go, then it momentarily resting against him before violently pushing him back. The next thing he knows, he’s hanging upside down with lots of air below him. All this in the space of perhaps 3 to 5 seconds, at most. Fred has fallen about 30 feet – he had been about 15 feet above the Friend – and to the side in a shallow gully. He is hanging upside down, arms stretched above his head and he is not moving. Oh Shit… “Fred are you all right?” I scream. To my vast relief he immediately responds, “Yea, I’m fine”. He tries to right himself, but his right foot is caught under the rope. I carefully lower him to a small stance where he is able to get his foot out and he stands up. I am relieved to see no blood on his head, he obviously has an intact spinal cord and all his other parts seem to be working. He carefully checks himself. Suddenly he breaks out in a grin, leans forward, and from beneath a pile of rocks pulls his favorite blue cap. It however, has two large tears in it. Fred’s pants are also shredded in several places. BFF Once we get past the initial shock, Fred continues up, but not before taking several pictures of his now BFF: Best Friend Forever. I am impressed that the Friend held so well, as the fall was to the side rather than down the fall line of the rope. It was damaged and will need to be retired. The rope didn’t come out unscathed either – two cuts into the sheath. The rope is about 6 years old and held such a hard fall, it is also being retired. After we got home, careful inspection of my helmet plus its age has made me decide to replace it as well. Since we were far closer to the summit than the bottom, it was best to finish the climb. From the summit we were in two hours back to the car. Fred was starting to stiffen up. My back hurt a bit and my belay hand was sore and bit banged up. However, neither of us has any complaints – we were damned lucky with respect to the falling rock. AftermathI have caught Fred and other people several times on lead. The usual fall while on lead provides at least some sort of warning or indication that it is about to happen and it doesn’t normally include almost a quarter of a ton of granite. The sudden violence of this fall was absolutely astounding. Many have become blasé if not downright arrogant about climbing fourth and lower fifth class unroped. Simul-climbing is an increasingly popular technique. If Fred and I had been doing either, at least one if not both of us would probably be dead - especially if we had been simul-climbing. I am convinced that we both would have fallen, doubling (or more) the strain on the system, perhaps to failure. By being in a conventional belay, I could hang on to Fred and duck. Even if I had been hit, I had stopped Fred before the first rocks arrived, so if I had let go, I think he might have been able to catch himself on trees – and he certainly would have been stopped by the belay anchor, which was a rope sling around a big burly tree. If there was any criticism, it was that Fred was not wearing a helmet, a point he readily concedes. Fred ended up with only some severe bruising and scrapes. Luckily, the slab did not hit him during the fall after initially pushing him off the rock. It was large enough to have done some very serious damage if it had. Please, folks, err on the side of safety. If the consequence of a fall, regardless how caused, is serious injury or death, belay it, no matter how easy is seems. And if you belay, do it right. As a friend in Austria once said to me, “Better to be a coward for a second than dead a life time”.

multi-day,A Bonanza Extravaganza!,"PROLOGUESummiting Bonanza Peak has been in my thoughts for quite some time. It is not only the highest non-volcanic mountain in Washington, it is also considered to require a range of mountaineering skills to summit. Just thinking about the peak has kept me up some nights, and caused me to shiver with both anticipation and concern at some other times. Bonanza Peak Since I first seriously began considering attempting the Washington County Highpoints during the past two years, Bonanza Peak has been in the forefront of my mountaineering goals yet in the background of my mountaineering reality. I knew a successful summit attempt would require not only confidence in my own abilities but also require having a good team, good route conditions, and good weather. ""Gimpilator"" Adam, myself, and our mountaineering friend Dave had a successful summit trip at Mount Olympus during the first week of July. We worked very well as a team during that trip, with each teammate having a lot of mountaineering skills but each person also having a specific strong skill to add to the team. My strong skill was planning and navigation, Gimpilator's strong skill was glacier travel, and Dave's strong skill was rock climbing. The team worked so well together that we were hoping to have similar success on Bonanza Peak the following week... DAY ONE: The Trip To High CampAfter spending the previous night in Chelan, Washington, we drove to the ferry dock at the southern end of Lake Chelan during the early morning of July 10. We caught the ""Lady of the Lake II"" passenger ferry, which we would be aboard for three hours while en route to a stop at Lucerne. Lucerne was once an old port and homestead location along Lake Chelan, and offered the easiest, most direct access to the old mining town of Holden Village. For many years, with the old mining operations long since ceased, Holden Village has since become a Lutheran camp and facility, but the public is welcome to use their daily bus transportation between the village and Lucerne. While at Holden we checked into the ""Hike Haus"" (climbers register) and cached what looked to be unnecessary gear there. We encountered two peakbagging acquaintances, Franklin and Carla, while at the village. We spoke with them for quite a while, before we finally began hiking at 2:00 PM. A deer led us out of the village, before stopping to forage. Our Team At Holden Village Deer Foraging Near Holden The hike to Holden Lake was fairly uneventful. The trail was in excellent condition, the weather was great, and we had time on our side. Within the final 0.25-0.50 miles to the lake we started encountering snow, which we would be traveling on for the rest of our ascent to Holden Pass. Traveling around the lake to its northern end was mostly a combination of swampy crossings, slide alder bushwhacks, and questionable snow bridges. Fortunately, once we were at the northern end of Holden Lake our route became an obvious ascent up snowy slopes along the right side of slide alder forests and snowmelt streams. Log Jam Along Trail Holden Lake Bonanza Peak, As Seen From Holden Lake Snowy Route From Holden Lake As we approached the final snowy slopes to Holden Pass we could see an abundance of waterfalls below the Mary Green Glacier. However, there were fewer waterfalls than we had seen in photos, largely due to the amount of snowpack still remaining on the glacier and mountain slopes. After we found a nice flat area (~6400' elevation) for our tent only a short distance above Holden Pass, we began assessing possible routes for passing through or around the waterfall section. Our Bonanza Campsite Waterfall Ledges Below Mary Green Glacier During our ascent we had found one possible snowy ramp near one nearby waterfall, but once at our campsite we found a snowy slope leading up to the ridge above and seemingly bypassing the waterfall section. Dave scouted out the snowy slope while Adam gathered water and I shoveled out parts of our campsite. Dave returned with good news; the snowy slope apparently led all the way to the glacier, unobstructed except for one very brief walk up a minor rocky ramp and through a couple of evergreen trees. Plus, it appeared the waterfalls could be avoided completely. That was better news than we originally anticipated, as some people consider the waterfall section to be the crux of Bonanza Peak ascents. DAY TWO, PART I: The Glacier ClimbWe woke shortly before 4:00 AM on July 11. After eating some breakfast and double-checking our gear, we began hiking at 5:15 AM. The beginning of the ascent went very well. Dave's assessment for the beginning of the route was totally correct, and this certainly eliminated the need for spending a lot of time routefinding. Once atop a snowy ledge at ~6700' elevation, we ascended uphill until below a large rock cliff, which we then side-traversed along until reaching a basin located above most of the lower waterfalls. From the basin we began to angle uphill for a while, heading towards the northeastern end of the Mary Green Glacier. Approaching The Glacier... Sunrise! Shortly before reaching what we thought might be the edge of the glacier we encountered one steep rocky section with some easy ramps switchbacking up to the very steep snow slope above it. Or, at least we thought those were easy ramps; Dave slipped near the bottom of the rocks and hit his nose and mouth on a boulder, giving him a partial fat lip. He recovered fairly quickly, and we continued. Once atop the rocky slope, we briefly ascended the steep snowy slope above it until reaching a gentle slope on which we could rope-up for the glacier travel ahead. Shadow Of Our Team On The Glacier Travel along the Mary Green Glacier was surprisingly easy. The amount of deep snowpack filled and covered any crevasses that may have existed along the northern traverse. Although, with that said, we saw plenty of crevasses and seracs towards the southern end of the glacier. We traversed by and through some remnants of some avalanches and cornice-breaks, but those dangers had long since ceased before our visit. Crossing Mary Green Glacier Ice Blocks On Glacier We carefully ascended the steep snow thumb that winds west and then north to a large bergschrund. Considering the amount of snowpack still present on the mountain, I was shocked to find the bergschrund (~8600' elevation) nearly completely opened. We each crossed the bergschrund, one person at a time, needed to take a small step of faith to cross. Ascending Snow Thumb... Bergschrund On Upper Snow Thumb The glacier climb was complete. Now came the hard part. We just did not anticipate how hard the final 900' of vertical gain would be. DAY TWO, PART II: The Rock ClimbThe standard route typically requires Class 3 scrambling, with some brief sections of Class 4 terrain, starting at a large gully above the bergschrund. Unfortunately, due to the near-record snowpack this year the entire gully was covered in snow. There were numerous cracks and moats seen within the snow, as well, making any attempt to use the standard approach a likely futile and possibly deadly choice. We knew some people who had summited Bonanza Peak the previous week with even more snow pack, by ascending up steep slopes, many of which were snow-covered, to the summit. Unfortunately for our team, the conditions had since changed. Looking up the peak, the gentler, more-standard slopes contained a combination of steep snow gullies, icy underlayers, and minor snowmelt streams. This left us with one viable choice: Have a roped rock climb up one of the main rappel routes. We quickly realized that the remainder of the trip would make-or-break depending upon Dave. That was a lot to ask of one person, but considering his vast rock climbing expertise the conditions put our team in that situation. Ultimately, it would be Dave's decision how we would continue and if we would continue. Having already gone sofar, Dave was determined to reach the summit... but only if the entire team could safely do so. Dave Leads The Climb... Second Pitch Dave Waits While Gimpilator Climbs... Climbing The Rappel Route... Ascending Steep Snow Between Rock Climb Sections... Rock Climbing Near ~9200 Elevation Each pitch took a long time, both because of having a three-man team and because of searching for the best spots for belays and anchors. Slowly but surely, after several steep snow ascents and nine pitches, we final reached the final summit ridge. This ascent was extremely time-consuming yet as safe as we could be under the circumstances. Once at the summit ridge, Adam followed the brief rocky knife-edge ridge up to a final steep, exposed snow slope to the summit, followed by Dave and then me. We did not use a rope for that final summit ridge, although the amount of occasional exposure made us consider it. Although the final slope was snow-covered, the summit itself was rocky. We found the register box, which only contained a single paper within it. Atop The ""25' Vertical Class 4 Rock"" At Summit Ridge Scrambling The Summit Ridge... Northeast View From Summit Summit Pose After taking a few photos, handshakes, and a short video, we turned around to head back down. Just then, I unexpectedly began to cry. I think that was the moment I finally grasped the achievement. I suddenly realized that my quest to summit the Washington County Highpoints would likely eventually become a reality. Bonanza Peak was the highpoint I was most concerned about on that list. I still needed to summit Big Horn and Mount Baker, but neither of those two mountains are considered as physically or technically demanding as Bonanza Peak. I turned back around and shook Gimpilator's hand, thanking him for being my friend, and then headed down. Example Of Cascade Giants Seen From Bonanza Peak DAY TWO, PART III: The Long DescentWe still had plenty of daylight and good weather, but the total ascent from camp took much longer (8h30m) than any of us originally anticipated. We figured the descent would be equally as long, if not moreso. Fortunately, it was only 2:00 PM and we were hoping for a consistent yet safe series of rappels down the mountain. Considering we were basically rappeling the same route we rock climbed, we figured the descent would take nearly the same amount of time as the ascent had. Actually, it would take us nearly an hour longer. Gimpilator Rappels! Dave Rappels! Waiting For The ""OK"" To Begin Next Rappel... Redwic Rappels! We still had daylight when we reached the bergschrund (which had opened-up further during that day) and snow thumb, and after roping-up we descended to the Mary Green Glacier. The sunset occurred as we reached the glacier below the snow thumb, although there was still plenty of lingering daylight. We retraced our route until returning back to near the northeastern end of the glacier, at which point the sky darkened. I grew concerned but had put GPS waypoints and our track log into my GPS. Gimpilator started to get very tired and occasionally questioned our route, but Dave and I remembered much of the route and had our GPS devices as backups if needed. The descent seemed slow-going but was as safe as we could be. Once below the glacier and on the snowy slopes above the waterfalls, we began our long side-traverse. Suddenly, we saw a light flashing from a location along our intended descent route. We headed towards the light and found two people in a tent, camped only ~300' elevation above our camp. After a brief conversation, we continued to camp. Each one of us made it back to camp safely, both relieved and excited about what we had just achieved that day. We not only summited a technically difficult peak, but we did it using a different approach and much longer than expected. During that night, the weather took a turn for the worse, raining and hailing seemingly non-stop. The bad weather stopped by 7:30 AM, and we were ready to head back to Holden by 8:45 AM. We quickly realized that a lot of snow had melted-out that previous day. This was especially apparent between Holden Pass and Holden Lake, where most of the climbers path was visible/melted-out (which was completely snow-covered during the ascent 36 hours earlier). When we arrived back in Holden Village by noon, we celebrated with a nice meal followed by some espresso (Gimpilator, Dave) and ice cream shakes (Dave, me). We departed on the bus, being waved ""good bye"" by the Holden crowd, and headed to the ""Lady of the Lake II"" ferry. We arrived back in Chelan several hours later, and then began the long drive home from there. A Well-Deserved Rest On The Ferry EPILOGUESummiting Bonanza Peak was a major mountaineering goal for the three of us. For me, personally, it was my 37th Washington County Highpoint and the crowning achievement of that list thus far. We each needed to trust our partners, trust our skills, and trusts our instincts. We were successful in summiting the mountain, working well as a team, and getting back safely. Here are some trip statistics: -> Nine roped rock climbs/belays for the final 900' of vertical gain. -> 12 rappels for the descent of the same slopes. -> 8h30m to reach the summit from our camp at Holden Pass. Six of those hours were on the final 900' vertical feet. -> 15 minutes at the summit. -> 9h30m to reach our camp at Holden Pass from the summit. Seven of those hours were spent rappelling down to near the bergschrund. -> 18h15m total time on summit day, roundtrip.

Clearly out of all the climbs you have done, I think this is the most impressive yet. You used all the skills you needed here and the reward was an amazing summit that blows away the volcanoes. Most impressive is that you climbed the peak when the main route was out of service. I think that this climb has made you three more than strong enough to go for all on the Bulger List and maybe far greater worldwide. I hope to see you three go in that direction and knock off some great summits like Johannesburg and Terror which many just dream about. Viewing: 1-13 of 13 to post! Don't have an account?"
single-day,Defying My Illness-A November Wake Up To The Mountains,"POO POO POINT: Whoo Whoo for Poo Poo!!! (11/01/09) What I find especially engaging, charming and inspirational about Poo Poo Point is that if you are a beginning hiker, or you are just interested in getting back in shape again for any reason, or you are overweight and have 100 pounds to lose (like me) ...then Poo Poo Point is great and that is because you can meet the amazing Paragliders who walk to the top, one, two, (and some of them...I know because I asked) ...three times a day just so they can jump off and be like eagles off of the beautiful view and summit. By the way, though most hikers do not seem to flinch at the name (I guess after 200 mountains hiked, the names of mountains do not phase a person), I for one wanted to know the origin of the name of Poo Poo Point. The best I found was from the link at the end of the article that says that hikers thought it sounded like ""Poo Poo"". However, I must contest this in a friendly way. I mean, wouldn't it sound like ""Choo Choo?"" Maybe the train was congested? Or perhaps someone's dog was going to the bathroom at that time when the train sound went off? Anyway, it is certainly a topic for continued discussion. EastKing (my husband) has written many trip reports, and although I might have issues with his punctuation or grammar (I was the English major) , he is better at talking about hikes in depth from a technical standpoint. I like to write about my impressions of the hike more than anything. It is pretty major for me to even post these pics because of the fact that I usually cannot be pictured without make up. That all changed with the below pics. For me, an impression on the hike takes in the whole feel of the experience. That includes the hikers I meet along the way. It also includes the weather. It also includes the surrounding nature and foliage...like: What color were the leaves that day? Well, I can tell you that the leaves were quite bright and fall was definitely in full view through the beautiful yellow leaves. I am holding one of my favorite ones in the picture. :agree: Also, I think of things like: What do I remember most about this day in terms of the people? What I remember most were: One guy telling me ""Good job, keep it up, You can do it."" His voice (aside from EastKing's) has stayed with me since then, up the three other summits and hike that I have done. I have an amazingly supportive husband, but the kindness of strangers (especially after getting those questionable, disapproving looks from strangers after my sweat drips down) is not to be underrated. I also remember how very painful and hard this hike was...my first real hike in over a year. It was extremely difficult, but I kept pressing on. I know it is hard for some people to realize that it could be that difficult for someone to do Poo Poo, but it really was difficult and excrutiating for me. For me, what I can tell you about Poo Poo Point is that it was an amazing time for me. For me, it was very uncharacteristic to pick my husband up from his hotel and tell him I am ready for a walk, much less a hike. Well, this day, I knew I was ready. I knew I was ready to do something to reverse the depressing tide of chronic pain (from Interstitial Cystitis...read below comments) and growing obesity (Now, they are finding a massive hormonal and thyroid imbalance that may have caused some of it but not all of it.) So I told Greg we ought to do a hike and he was happy, but not sure if I was serious. I think he knew I was serious once I hit the trail. I was serious because this was the first time I did not turn around and badger him or tell him I could not do it. I was determined to keep doing it and I kept going, and going, and going. Although, I stopped a lot and I was sweating so hard that my entire head got wet from sweat and I was wearing the wrong clothes. What is great is having EastKing to stand behind me every step of the way. And to know that though he has summited Rainier, he is able to relate to his wife and understand the pain and challenges I have. I just kept thinking, ""This is the only way I am going to ever conquer my chronic pain...by proving to myself that I can do something like this."" I also grew accustomed on this trail to the ""What, you never saw a fat, sweaty, out of breath woman on a trail before"" look. So, I just smiled to myself knowing that I was indeed an oddity. I mean, the irony is as much as people are so quick to judge me for being overweight (I get the same thing at the gym) they do not realize that I am actually moving and off my butt to begin with. I found Poo Poo Point (I still find the name funny and so do others who I tell about it) to be challenging and difficult. That is coming from someone who has 100 pounds to lose. What I like about it are the many variating viewpoints, the amazing views all along the way, the switchbacks and the challenge it present as an ""easy"" trail. What is best about Poo Poo is the view. I have to say that it was pretty good. I felt at least that I had done all that backbreaking, sweaty hard work for something. NUMBER ONE DOWN! Thanks to everyone for their encouragement and support. I am fighting for my life here, to find a way to cope and manage with my pain and you have helped me be able to do that. You are all inspirational. [u][b]OTHER PERSONAL REMARKS: [/b][/u] I had this amazing energy that day. I am not sure what it was...Maybe pent up energy for months and months and months and months of being holed up in my apartment from being unemployed. Perhaps wondering if I still made a difference to anyone or anything. All I know is, that day, I wanted to make a difference for myself. I may never have the passion for hiking that EastKing does, but I do know that through hiking, I can have some life changing things happen. From the bottom of the trail, I met some paragliders who were trying to recruit me which I found endearing and laughable at the same time, considering the fact that I am afraid that my sheer weight alone would plummet me down to the ground. But these, fit, lithe types were ready to offer me to fly up with them. It was pretty neat, but I do have a fear of flying, so I told them that maybe once I get over that fear, I will do it with them. IF YOU ARE NOT OVERWEIGHT AND SEE AN OVERWEIGHT HIKE: Please be supportive. They are going through excrutiating pain, either emotionally or physically or both, just from trying to make it up the trail. So support them by saying ""Hi"" or just an encouraging word. Get out of your comfort zone. IF YOU ARE OVERWEIGHT AND WANT TO DO A TRAIL LIKE ME: Just take one step at a time. Go as slow as you want. Remember, it is a long trek and journey anyway, emotionally and spiritually, so just wear the proper gear to increase your comfort and just keep going. Ask for help when you need it. Drink water. GETTING TO POO POO POINT: Location: Take I-90 to Issaquah, take Front Street exit. Follow Front Street through the town of Issaquah. Then, Front Street turns into Hobart-Issaquah Road. Trailhead is at the paraglider area (refer to a map) . Elevation Start/End: 2000 foot overall elevation gain. Length: 4 miles round trip Source below taken from: (Google Search, ""Poo Poo Point: Result: http://www.niffgurd.com/mark/hikes/2004/june/12th/content.html Author unknown, below excerpt taken from link above) Trail Info: West end of Tiger Mountain. The point got its name from logging signals using a whistle that made a ""poo poo"" sound. The trailhead from the hang-glider area is the steeper of two routes to Poo Poo point. The trail climbs steeply and steadily all the way to the top. At the point your presented with panoramic views of Squak Mountain, Lake Samammish and Issaquah. There is also a clearing on the back side of the point with an amazing view of Mount Rainier. Little Si (SOLO!!)11/08/09 Ah, yes, talk about memorable trips...I must say that so far, Little Si remains my most memorable for several reasons: 1. The most ""I have never seen an overweight and sweaty woman panting to stay alive"" looks from people I encountered on the trail. 2. An interesting time for me as this was my first hike by myself on any trail, anywhere. So, for me, it was a pretty big deal. 3. A chance to prove to EastKing that I had built up enough motivation, for my second hike in over a year, to really be serious about saving my own life, both literally (weight loss and fitness) and figuratively (learning how to not let the pain take over my life.) 4. A chance for me to see how I would respond to a hike alone. I must say, I have done a lot of reading on Little Si and I think this mountain is underrated in terms of what it has to offer. In my conversation with a very nice person who had summited Rainier, we both agreed that Little Si has an ample amount of geographical range in terms of the changing of landscape and especially the wind. In fact, that is what really makes Little Si feel like a bigger mountain...because when you get to the top, the wind really starts blowing. Also, some people find it easy. I completely disagree. I found it very difficult, but then again, I do have a 100 pound backpack to lose. To further my point about the wind, I found this from this website, ""//www.mountsi.com/littlesi.htm, '""So now hikers tackle Little Si in the winter when the wind and/or rain seem a bit much for its popular counterpart above, or simply for a change of pace. And it makes a great hike around the holidays, being close to the city and offering a chance to get out in the weather and work off some calories. Little Si is part of the Mount Si Natural Resources Conservation Area, managed by the state Department of Natural Resources and created to preserve the area's natural ecosystems. Little Si is a real mountain and on a windy day it can feel like you're miles from nowhere, especially near the summit, which is mostly bald and exposed to the elements.""' Little Si is just a great all around hike for kids, families, friends, couples, and people like me, struggling to get hiking experience or those who are already experienced. Some observances: 1. If you don't like crowds, you may want to choose another, more solitary hike. 2. Prepare for slippery conditions in the rain as the trail is often rockier. 3. Prepare for windy conditions and chill at the top, especially anytime after October/November, as it does get cold (and I, very stupidly, did not have gloves) and prepare for adding an extra layer. 4. If you get there after 12 noon, you will have a very hard time finding parking, so get there earlier, IF you can. Also, it has an amazing view for a smaller summit, or ""dumpster dive"" as some love to say...but to me, it remains, at least for now, a difficult mountain. The most difficult one I ever did thus far SINCE I have hiked in Washington. But this is the second time I have done it. Yep, that is right, but it seemed so long since I last did it that I seemed to almost forget. I also found it very hard, as I found Poo Poo Point, but I think my body was in some sort of protest, because every step hurt and ached with the fibromyalgia and Interstitial Cystitis, but I knew I had to keep going. However, this time, it was raining the whole time with very questionable weather and I was worried as I am a new hiker and was wondering what I would do if I got stuck in the rain. Therefore, the rain made for slippery, and often scary conditions on the trail. I would recommend going when it is sunny, for sure. However, if you do go when it is raining, make sure you have good hiking boots with non slippage mechanisms. I was just simply determined to keep going. The most amusing part of the trail were the urban hikers who seemed to be extending their boardroom meeting on the trail, would section off into a cluster to discuss and banter about their workplace shenanigans, and then every time they saw me gaining on them, they would realize that they had to hurry up. I kept saying hello to them at each one of those meetups and each time I got the deer in the headlights look from, what I guess is, not seeing many overweight, sweaty women on the trail and realizing that I could not possibly gain on them! It is sort of interesting to me to gage such reactions now, since I learned on that trail not to let things bother me anymore if people were going to act that way. However, it bothered me enough on the trail to keep me going and I used my frustration to keep stepping. Now, I use those reactions to keep going, and more fodder and material for future stories. (They don't even realize they are giving me these gifts!) So, when I got to the top, I saw the group of guys and one of them managed a ""hi"" but I cannot say I encountered the friendliest crew up there. I can say that it was very satisfying to have made it to the top and to be able to tell my husband, EastKing, who had been attempting Mt. St. Helens that I was not fully committed to hiking again. It has definitely helped our relationship. And I am so grateful for the Little Si experience, with its mixture of negatives and positives ...It prepared me for future things I will experience on future trails. ABOUT LITTLE SI: From Karen Sykes, ""Hike of the Week: Little Si"", dated, December 12th, 1996 : '""Getting there ""Drive Interstate 90 and take the main North Bend exit, heading left into town. Turn right on North Bend Way and drive a couple miles to the Mount Si Road. Turn left, cross the bridge over the Snoqualmie River and park near the bridge in the marked lot. Trail detail Travel about one-quarter mile along 434th Street, passing houses and dogs of varying disposition. Respect private property; residents often complain about heavy foot traffic and dogs that hikers let run in their yards. The Department of Natural Resources' management plan calls for a new parking area and trailhead for the Little Si trail, and with luck it should be secured and open by next year. Until then, agency officials ask that you not park along the road and respect local residents' rights.""' I LET OUT BARELY A BALK ON SQUAK (11/15/09) I know, the title is corny, but come on, that is what makes it fun. In all seriousness, Squak Mountain was a lot easier than I had anticipated as East King had told me that it has a higher elevation gain. I found Squak to be pretty long for a gradually gaining in elevation trail. As with Cougar and Little Si, I found many beautiful fall leaves. (The only thing is, unless you have a phone book in the car or something heavy to compress the leaves, they dry up once you go home.) I also found it to be fun, in a sense, to just go up one long road to the top. I love how it was like one long extension of a road that reminded me of my grandfather's gravel road to his farmhouse (Almost as long!) Anyway, Squak is great for those who want to train up and get back in shape or for those who are with families or couples. I think it is great because it does not offer much in the way of obstacles on the trail, because there is no ""trail"" to speak of, but there is challenge in the sense that it is a strong workout and it is long. (For a ""small"" trail.) I like Squak Mountain because it is certainly not a traditional hike. I must say that I wished that it did have a better view. I really wished that when I got to the top, it had a better view. As usual, I sweated a lot and had a lot of pain going up. Many times I had to stop and sort of face my demons, really face the fact that what I want is to make this mountain but that I have extreme pain and really face the fact that my pain is severe and that it will be a real fight to do any mountain at this point. Conditions can get cold, as we noticed (me and EastKing), especially close to the top, especially if it is after October/November and especially if all you have is a rain jacket (like me.) So, just like with Little Si, these are ""smaller"" mountains, but you still need to bring your layers and make sure you have the proper footing. I recommend going earlier in the day on a nicer, sunnier day as it can get quite wet and cold if you leave later in the day. Of course, it depends on you, as some do not mind hiking in the rain. This was my third greatest accomplishment this month, and it was with Squak that I knew I had changed the tide of something in my life and that I was at least committing to myself, if nobody else, the importance of caring about myself and about fitness and about conquering this monster called Interstitial Cystitis (chronic bladder inflammation.) I am lucky, as usual, to have supportive hiking partner in my husband. Long Live Squak! LOOKING FOR SHY BEAR ON WILDERNESS PEAK (COUGAR MOUNTAIN (11/21/09) Cougar Mountain was to mark my fourth entryway into a new life for myself and not allowing chronic pain to control my life. By this time, I was starting to feel like an Issaquah Alps expert. Aside from the fact that I have been wanting to move to Issaquah since I moved here (Just have not been able to afforde it) I feel repeatedly drawn to the area. I think what is incredible about Cougar Mountain and surrounding areas are the sheer number of possibilities there are for outdoor recreation. And also, the leaves are quite beautiful and varied on this trail. It also reminded me of various hikes I did with EastKing in New Hampshire when I had been in much better shape. I had thought Cougar Mountain would have a much better view with the fact that a whole area is named after it. I was disappointed to find that I worked hard, huffing and puffing and that the view was not there. However, it was nice to encounter other friendly hikers on this day and to go across the neat, little bridges that I saw along the way. This is from,' ""http://www.weekendhike.com/2008/05/cougar-mountain-wilderness-cliffs-trail.html.""As you reach the top of Wilderness Peak, you enter a very nice area with lots of birds and critters running around. There is also a very short trail leading to the top of Wilderness Peak (elevation 1,595 feet). However, there is no real view from here. The Cliffs trail technically ends here and the Wilderness Peak Trail starts.""' I must say, we did not see a lot of birds or animals, but this must have been written in the summertime. I must say that the trail was beautiful to me and quite varying in its beauty...many interesting logs...beautiful small waterfalls. The most notable things for me on this trip were: Encountering many trail runners on the trail and MOST MEMORABLE: Seeing a guy who was my size hiking his butt off just like I was. We nodded at each other knowingly and I admired him for working his butt off and in turn, was able to admire myself as well for the attempts I was making. SO GET OUT THERE, OVERWEIGHT COUCH POTATOES, YOU ARE NOT ALONE! It was disappointing in the sense that it had no view for (again, for me) was an exhausting and fatiguing workout. But it did have a nice logbook and some interesting log entries. Also, it was great to read the touching and loving inscription on the bench from someone who had the bench dedicated to them (Darn it, I did not write the name down of who it was dedicated to) due to their love of mountains. I read most of the entries in the logbook, and I must know who ""Shy Bear"" is or what people are referring to. As a writer, legends are quite appealing for the sheer amount of fodder for inspiration or future storytelling, so I would be quite interested in knowing from anyone if they know who ""Shy Bear"" is. As I was contemplating this, I was also discussing various possibilities of the origin of this legend and grilling EastKing about it, since he, after all, is the more experienced hiker. It was quite interesting to read entries like, ""Sorry we missed you Shy Bear. See you next year."" Or ""Shy Bear, I came all the way here to see you and I cannot find you."" So, it was indeed quite intriguing for me. Also, I am very interested and passionate about Native American culture and I could not help but wonder if it was not a Native American legend that had managed to survive and somehow became popularized. Well, the theories do abound, so if anyone could shed some light on this for me, that would be great! As for my log entry, I said I was disappointed with the view, but I was happy that I was finally becoming an official hiker. THE SIMPLE BEAUTY OF COAL CREEK FALLS(11/29/09) I have done Coal Creek Falls once before with EastKing, but doing it in the fall seemed different. The fall leaves by this time were all on the ground, but still, for late November, a fair amount of evidence left that Fall is still with us. I love the fact that as you get closer to the falls you can hear them, and for waterfall enthusiasts and poets like myself, it is like a sweet song of music that I love and it draws me to it. Nothing is more of a healing salve to me than being near water like this. This day was overcast, as were a few other days we have gone out hiking, but we took it in stride. The great part is that although we did not do this in the summer, we did this in the fall and the waterfall was at its height. Coal Creek Falls is a relaxing hike and although it was disappointing that I did not get to do a bigger summit (I had early Chorus rehearsal) it was nice to gain a new respect for the beauty of the falls and to have the chance and opportunity to ruminate on that for a while before I had to rush back. I HIGHLY recommend this trail even for highly advanced hikers, if for nothing else, than to experience the relaxation and beauty of the falls.

single-day,A Day of Pure Alpine Excellence,"Introduction ""While there is a technical side to mountaineering, a confrontation with the raw power of the mountains that came only to be understood by those who venture into the hills, there is an essential element that everyone is familiar with, and that is the friendship you forge along the way. This is such a pivotal part of the experience, that alpinists have given it is own name: The Fellowship of the rope. Because at the end of the day, you may have made the summit, you might have had to turn around, but regardless of the outcome, you have spent an amazing day with a close friend."" - Timb Argast Ever since the first time I have ever stepped foot on Sahale, it has become my favorite mountain. Each time was a new experience for me, almost as if stepping into another world. This time was no exception, it was even better than I had anticipated. Before the trip the mountain had received several inches of snow covering the upper slopes as well as all the other mountains in the entire region. With the weather forecast looking good for summit day, I knew this would be an excellent adventure! The trip started on September 27 when Bryan picked me up from my house for the adventure. Despite the cloudiness and rain in the air, I eagerly waited as we got closer to the mountain. The Cascade Valley was just pouring down rain, fortunately we were in a truck which made sleeping out much friendlier. The next morning we woke up at around 5:30 a.m. to get ready for the climb. Whitehorse covered in Clouds on the way to Sahale Hiking to the Quien Sabe GlacierThe hike up to Boston Basin was pretty easy although according to my North Cascades Hiking Guide Book it is considered ""Very Difficult"". I guess that's what happens when you go climbing mountains several times a week. As morning came on we were hoping to see the sunrise which we happened to be in a thick part of the woods. But at least what was to come later that day made up for it. Waterfalls in the Woods Blue Sky in the Early Morning Looking towards Cascade Valley What Appears to be a Cornice Sunrise on the Glacier A Clearing through the Fog Light Contrast on Hidden Lake Peak Johannesburg Covered in Clouds After getting out of the woods the clouds were clearing off Mount Torment and Forbidden Peak. We had a few more creek crossings before we finally start encountering snow and ice. Keep in mind I was in tennis shoes during this part which made crossing over icy boulders over a creek a bit challenging. A few times I almost fell in. Finally I decided it was not worth dealing with the dozens of frozen creeks through out the boulder field which I stayed by a saddle that went up into Boston Basin. Mount Torment in the Morning Creek before Boston Basin Notch Between Two Mountains Mount Torment Lit Up Ice Crystals on the Plants Waterfalls in Boston Basin Boston Basin and Forbidden Peak Hiking towards Sahale Johannesburg Covered in Fresh Snow Once it became snowier I decided to ditch my tennis shoes and swap to climbing boots. Boston Basin was just covered in fresh slippery ice which made traveling a bit dicey. Fortunately I found what looked like a potential route up that avoided most of the icy boulder but up a steep rock section with a little bit of ice. After crossing a few more ice sections we finally start getting into some real snow making travel much safer and with ease. Sharkfin Tower Forbidden Peak's Summit Upper Reaches of Forbidden Peak Crevasses on the Quien Sabe Snowking Mountain in the Distance Winds on Boston Peak Boston Basin Covered in Ice Beautiful Cascade Peak Mixup Peak Clearing Up Finally we arrive at the Quien Sabe Glacier which meant that it was time to rope up. As we were getting ready the sun started rising over the ridge, but at the same time the winds picked up. The land certainly had a majestic feel to it as I heard the sounds of fine ice crystals blowing in the wind. The mountains now looked very dramatic and gave a certain sense like I was in the Himalaya. Every spare second I couldn't help but glance at all the scenery around. Icy Landscape with Johannesburg Fresh Snow on Cascade Peak Eldorado Peak with Mount Torment Bryan with Johannesburg Heading up Sahale A Fun Alpine ExperiencePutting on the gloves and grabbing my ice axe in my hands I announced ""Time to get my Alpine On!"". We were both excited to now be climbing on the Quien Sabe Glacier. Although with it's beauty we also had to take caution because many of the crevasses around we could see were covered up by fresh powder giving the feeling as though walking through a mine field. But the good news was that this part of the glacier did not seem to have as many crevasses as other parts. Sun Rising Above Sahale Upper Reaches of Sahale Bryan getting Started Sharkfin Tower Jagged Spire on Boston Peak Boston Peak's Summit Block Looking South from Quien Sabe Wind Blown Crevasse We were making great time climbing up the Quien Sabe, but then our paced got slower as the slope got steeper. I was having such a good time that when I finally looked below me I realized that we were on a bit of a steep slope, although manageable as long as you make good steps. Suddenly we reached a part of the climb where a crevasse that was hidden cut all around our surroundings above us. After a little bit of investigating I figured out a round about way going to the left. The rest of the way up the Quien Sabe Glacier was drama free and enjoyable. Looking Down Below Looking up the Quien Sabe Glacier Bergschrund below Boston Peak Mount Baker and Eldorado Peak Forbidden Peak's East Face Rime Ice on Boston's Spire Taking a Rest in Front of Boston Peak Looking Northwest At the very end of the Quien Sabe Glacier there was a bit of a snow covered moat. Bryan was worried about this, so I got ready in ice axe arrest position in case anything went wrong. After crossing over the moat and hiking up a dozen or so feet we were off the West Face and onto the North Ridge. From here I took up the leading position. Mount Goode looking Good Black Peak looking White Mount Logan's West Face The Summit Ridge Having a Great Time Buckner Covered in Snow I figured our chances of summiting was quite high with how good the weather looked and us feeling well. I under estimated the summit block and the fresh snow that created a rime ice on the rocks. The North Ridge was a simple minor snow climb although it had a moment where the powder was loose with exposure, but still manageable. After getting over the first hump of the ridge we were suddenly met with a big cornice. At first it looked very unmanageable and extremely dangerous with thousands of feet of exposure. The idea of attempting it seemed like it would be out right insane. Fortunately I found that I could poke up through the cornice and get over back onto the glacier. Dome, Formidable, and Glacier Peak The Glacier soon ended and we were now about 150 feet from the summit, I could almost taste it. The sheer exposure on both sides of the ridge became evident with each step. On some of the steps I was kicking in it was loose powder with a layer of rime ice underneath making me a little nervous. But I was in full focus and kept my ice axe in as deep as I could to get it between rocks and sticking it into the rime. Then I reached a spot where it seemed impossible to climb any higher safely. The cliffs that many scramble up where covered in ice and loose snow which was certainly a no go. I climbed up a icy section to the left only to encounter a knife edge. Inspired by SP Member IcyPeak I considered riding the ridge. But the main problem was not only was it up sloped, heavily exposed, had rime ice on it, but there was also a hump in the middle of it which made it look so dangerous. Shaking on the ice I take a step onto it and instantly retreat and say ""People were not meant to go on this kind of terrain, especially with no line of protection. My partner's life is in my hands, so for the sake of both of us I will not continue"". My Partner with Boston Peak Sahale's Summit Block Sketchy Terrain Above I carefully down climb the icy terrain back to my partner to make one last attempt for the summit. It looked like there was a possible loop around on the West Face, but also very dangerous. It had just enough foot room for one to carefully scramble on it. My partner took a look and said ""forget it, it's not worth it"". I turned around and nodded in agreement that it was too sketchy. No hard feelings, after all we got the best reward of any mountaineer. A amazing alpine experience where I got to see some of the best scenery in Washington and a great thrilling experience. Plus I already summited this peak the previous year. It's a Long Ways Down Dicey Terrain Looking Over the Cornice West to North Panorama The Route I considered The Cornice Ridge We Crossed Over Going Back DownThe winds were starting to pick up on the Mountain which is why Bryan wanted to get down a ways in speedy fashion. I wanted to stay longer to enjoy the moment, but knew we had to get down before dark. The way back down was decent without any troubles, even the moat jump was not worry some. Later down the mountain there was one issue that we both ran into which our crampons kept balling up making each step a bit more slick. As a result we had to slow down to maintain safety. Looking Down Boston Basin Sahale's West Face Hiking Down Boston Basin Light Clouds over Boston and Sahale Sahale Mountain Covered in Snow Looking Back at our Tracks Boston and Sahale Looming Above Boston Basin Later in the Day At the edge of the Glacier we unroped and were finally able to travel down in a more casual tone. The hot afternoon sun had melted out a significant amount of snow in the region including the Boston Basin. Sahale though was still covered in all sorts of fresh snow because it had not seen much sun due to it's Westward face. The way down was less tedious than on the way up. From here it was a hour walk down to the car. Clouds Above Torment and Forbidden Turn off to Boston Basin The Route to Boston Basin Snow Blowing off of Johannesburg Cascade Peak and Johannesburg Above Crossing a Rock Slab Ash Berries Steep Trail Section Looking Down the Trail Purple Flower Johannesburg with the Sun Setting Sun Shining on the Cascade Valley Waterfalls in Boston Basin Last Light on the Triplets This was another amazing alpine experience which I hope to visit this place again some time in the near future. Certainly a 5 star mountain in my book.

multi-day,A Great Climb of Goode Mountain,"August 10 - 13 The northeast face, September 2011 At 9200 feet, Goode Mountain is the 9th highest peak in Washington state.  There is no easy way to reach the top of this remote mountain.  All routes have hideously long approaches, a matter of several days, and each one involves some degree of technical climbing.  Putting four men at the top would take a group effort, expedition style.  We decided to attempt the SW couloir route which finishes with a few pitches at the top of the northeast buttress. Nearing the north end of Lake Chelan We took the fast ferry to Stehekin Saturday, a town which is not accessible by road.  From there we hiked as far as we could before we were hit by storms.  We had planned to stay in 5-mile-camp which was supposed to be very nice, but we ran out of time for that.  Instead we pitched our tents off-trail down by the river, just before the rain started.  We nicknamed this spot Swamp Camp.  Thunder storms continued throughout the night, but I slept soundly with my earplugs in.  The next morning it was clear again, so Greg and I hiked from the park creek trail up along a climbers boot path to the climbers camp at 7390 feet.  It took us 2 hours and 45 minutes.  We were rushing ahead of Edward and Dave because we wanted to have a shot at climbing Storm King, a neighboring peak.  The boot path up to the climbers camp is hard to find at first but easy to follow most of the way.  Climbers Camp Below Goode Mountain After pitching our tent at 7380 feet we made the traverse on snow and loose rock over to Storm King.  We ascended loose talus/scree and then tricky slabs covered in loose scree.  We reached the base of the nasty loose rotten gully at 8250 feet.  We scrambled up another 15 feet.  Then a crack of thunder boomed.  Greg and I looked at each other.  F**k!  The rain started immediately.  We retreated to the base of the gully over loose wet rock and waited in a semi-sheltered moat to see what would happen next. The Loose Rotten Gully (Storm King summit at left) Greg below the notch Discussing our options, we decided to wait awhile longer and watch the weather.  Our hopes were that it would improve.  The sky didn't look that bad, just some light clouds and one dark one passing overhead toward the east.  After 15 minutes, the storm seemed to have passed and the sky looked promising again.  We started back up the gully until the scrambling became more intimidating.  I then belayed Greg while he place a few pieces and climbed up to the col.  When he got there I heard him say “Oh F**k!”  He later explained that he mantled up and came face to face with the abyss which is the northeast face.  The notch itself was only a foot wide. The Wall of Water At this point I heard more thunder.  I turned around and saw that the sky had darkened.  Then I noticed a wall of falling water coming our way.  It was infuriatingly cliche, but we were getting stormed-off Storm King.  I told Greg that I thought it would be better for him to rap down and clean the route rather than for me to come up to him.  It was time for us to leave and that's what we did.  The sky turned dark (rain drop on lens) We did our best to get back to camp before getting slammed by the storm.  There was heavy rain and then hail.  While crossing a moat at the edge of a snowfield, Greg fell 5 feet when the snow collapsed underneath him, softened by the heavy rain.  He cut his hand very deeply and there was blood everywhere, on the rocks, and all over his shirt.  The gash was half an inched deep and his skin had separated.  There was a lot of soft-tissue exposed.  I bandage him up with a wad of gauge and some duct tape.  I had to use a lot of tape because the rain was so heavy in that moment.  He tied a bandanna over the whole mess and we kept moving. I took this photo before I realized Greg was injured We got back to camp completely drenched and demoralized and spent the rest of the day in our tents hiding from the rain.  Alpenglow on Mount Buckner Gunsight Peak, Sinister Peak, Glacier Peak and Dome Peak The next day we we were up and moving by 6:15am.  Greg said he wasn't even going to think about the pain in his hand during the climb.  I wondered to myself how he was going to deal with it.  One thing was for sure, he would lead none of the pitches. Climbing above the glacier remnant Scrambling up talus on the ridge below the couloir We scrambled up the moraine and crossed the glacier remnant to reach the small rotten ridge below the southwest couloir.  A lot of rocks moved around as we were climbing up to reach the crest of the ridge.  We scrambled up along the crest until we could see the couloir above us.  We found one of two exposed ramps through the cliffs which allow access into the base of the couloir.  The couloir was broad and the scrambling easy.  Along the left side we found the mythical “black stairs”, a vein of darker solid rock with step formations which make for easy scrambling. Entering the southwest couloir Climbing the ""black stairs"" We continued to follow the black staircase to within 50 vertical feet of the apparent chimney at climbers left.  Here we roped up and Dave led a horizontal slab pitch to reach a hidden gully on the right side of the couloir.  Half way across the ledge he kicked loose a rock which went flying down the couloir (see the video). The slab ledge traverse Looking back down the couloir From the top of the hidden gully, we scrambled a few more feet up to ""black tooth notch"".  Whoa!  Suddenly we were high on the northeast face of Goode, with thousands of feet of exposure below us.  We followed a broad sandy ledge north for 30 feet and then rappelled down 20 feet to another ledge.  We followed the second ledge north and then scramble-traversed on 4th class rock over to the famed northeast buttress. The class 4 traverse On the northeast buttress On the buttress we roped up again and Edward led a long pitch up to a higher notch at the very top of the buttress.  We secured both ends of the rope so that Dave and I could climb simultaneously using prusiks.  That was our strategy for saving time.  Ideally, rock climbing is done in pairs but since there were four of us we had to do it differently.  The rock itself was easy, low to mid fifth class, but there were a lot of small blocks balanced precariously and it took care not to send these down on each other.  After Dave and I reached Edward, Greg followed at the end of the rope with a belay.  One thing was on all of our minds.  Was this good weather going to hold for us?  That was the big question.  After the major storm of the previous day, we were all a little jumpy. Above the glaciers on the northeast buttress The summit seen from the wrong notch Something didn't seem right.  The little notch we had climbed into was terribly exposed and what stood in front of us looked harder than it should be.  Apparently we were slightly off route.  Edward set a sling around what looked like a horn and Dave belayed Greg and Edward as they climbed down to a ledge about 20 feet below.  He then prepared to rappel down to the ledge.  I told him to wait a second because I didn't trust the look of the horn the sling was around.  I looked behind it and squatted down to see it from below.  Then I pushed on it and the whole thing moved.  Dave and I exchanged a knowing look.  I might have just saved his life.  Always check your horns!  I made a mental note to talk to Edward about it after the climb. Enjoyable climbing With Exposure Edward led the last long pitch straight up to the summit.  Now above the buttress, we climbed up more of a flat face.  There were a lot of features and it was nice enjoyable climbing with mad exposure!  Dave and I did used prusiks again and Greg followed with a belay at the end of the rope.  I was happy to see the bivy spots on the summit, which I had previously heard about.  There was a register from 2011 left by Franklin B and Andy D.  This was certainly one of the best views in Washington!  I could even see Johannesburg. The last 30 feet On the summit of Goode Mountain We reversed the route using both our 60 meters ropes for longer rappels.  After the first rap, the rope got stuck.  It would not budge.  I tied one end of it to my harness to act as a counter-weight while Greg prusiked up the other side to fix the problem. Mount Logan seen from the summit Forbidden Peak, Eldorado Peak, and Mount Baker seen from the summit There was one sketchy class 4 traverse near the top of Black Tooth Notch.  A sling had been left there as a psychological belay.  I added another sling to it ant then checked to make sure that the knots in the original sling were snug and trustworthy.  To my dismay I found that one of the tails of the knot in the original sling had slipped back inside the knot.  Tails on this type of know should be at least two inches long.  I took the time to take it apart and re-tie it, all the while holding onto the class 4 rock in such a precarious spot.  Honestly, this whole episode scared the crap out of me.  The first rappel Greg took this shot of me on the second rappel We spent a second night at high camp and hiked out the following day.  Back near Coon Lake, we encountered thousands of tiny toads on the ground.  It was difficult to avoid stepping on them but I did my best. Back at camp Tuesday evening we stayed with our friends Trapper and Roxanne at their cabin in Stehekin.  They cooked us pizza from scratch and offered us clean beds and showers.  What a treat!  I could tell they were living vicariously through our photos and stories of the climb.

multi-day,"Mt. Rainier, despite it all....","I can’t believe I made it! One day of training (being hurled down a slope hoping to god I paid attention when they were giving the self arrest instructions) and 3 days on the mountain. We encountered 90 degree heat while hoofing it up to base camp with our 50 pound packs, followed by freezing temperatures and then a huge thunder storm, with lightning of course….step away from the gear honey! Spent the first night with my 2 partners stuffed into supposedly a 3-man tent (would have liked to have seen an actual demo of that) with the howling winds causing the tent sides to slap me across the face all night. Night one, no sleep. The morning brought a big snowstorm, followed by hail and finally just a simple old-fashioned downpour. Spent the day acclimatizing, eating gummy bears and trying to avoid lightning. For the second night, I moved into the hut, rubbing my lucky rabbit’s foot that there was one spot left for me. Me, 11 others and a herd of furry little grey critters with twitching noses, enough said. Night two, no sleep. Add to that the horror of dehydrated food and half frozen pop tarts, the lost toe nail, the blue bags, the sitting on my camelback spout and getting my butt soaked at 2 am on summit day. Hmmm, think that's it...oh except for the fact that I had to pp in front of the entire all-guys team (headlamps down!..and I mean it!) ...ok, think that about covers it. Oh, almost forgot. Add to it the near death experience of one of my tent-mates when he sheepishly informed me that he “may have accidentally” eaten my last peanut butter and jelly sandwich. We were all given two (2) sandwiches…when you were eating the third (3rd)...didn’t you do the math! I’m still mad about that, haven’t been able to let that one go yet. This sandwich tragedy set-off drooling fantasies about scarfing down the all-day omelette special followed by dessert in a bowl, at Denny’s. Oh gawd. So anyway, in summary, it was a fantastic trip!! Would do it all over again in a heartbeat, minus the sandwich incident obviously. The summit was spectacular and this is what life is all about. Now, back to work where everything seems so boring in comparison, although, having water magically come out of a tap instead of hauling it on my back, not eating my dinner out of a bag and having a toilet to sit on are not to be underestimated.

single-day,"""This area makes me nervous""","Bob at the highpoint 7 years ago? Time is flying my friends, really flying. While looking through my pictures the other night, I came across the album of pics that brought back vivid memories of one of the highlight hikes of 2003. While not much has changed on Mt. Adams, a lot has changed for me. Of course I am now 7 years older (and hopefully wiser) but I have since retired from a dental practice in Kennewick Washington and moved across several states to the state of Utah where I am now involved in the education of dental hygiene students, a wonderful way to share my knowledge and experience with up and coming professionals. I am also living in a state that is loaded with mountains and things to do. As I approach my 70th year, I still feel young and vibrant and much of this I owe to my friends who I have developed over the past 7 years. Lucky is the man who has friends like Bob, Dennis, Rick, Bill, Kadee, Greg, Mike, Eric and the list could go on and on. No need to put last names here, you know who you are. Many many thanks. I dedicate this trip report to the guy who started it all, SP member Bob Bolton. To you Bob, I offer my finest salute and thanks. And of course, a special thanks and salute to my wife, without whose understanding and support of my mountain passion, none of this could have happened. One more note: This hike was toward the end of my first major season of hiking and climbing and had many many special events and climbs but this one is worth highlighting because the pictures do it so well for me. A long day on shaky rocks Bob Bolton: ""We got the asterisks off our lists by becoming the last known county highpointers to visit the new Skamania County highpoint who had previously climbed pre-eruption Mt. St. Helens. To all of you who compared the Skamania situation to the change in the Michigan state highpoint, fahhgetaboutit - there is no comparison! We did a very reasonable route for a one-day attempt, and even then it was at least 17 miles RT, with nearly half of that being off trail, with much of that on mobile boulders and/or Mt. St. Helens ash scree. Second, this route had a total elevation gain of just over 5,000 feet. There were three other routes with very similar total elevation gain (including the one from Cold Springs - by the time you consider the ups and downs on the Round the Mountain Trail, it would have been very close to 5,000 feet but with considerably more mileage). To put it mildly, this is a major effort no matter how you slice it."" Bob described it well in a report written for the cohp.org website. I for one will never forget this hike as it had a little of everything but best of all it had the companionship of a good friend, Bob Bolton. He was the one who introduced me to county highpointing and a bit later on, to prominence peaks, so it was one of many adventures we shared together. I had just done several other county high points (Clark) with Bill Jacobs and another by myself but this one was the highlight of a great weekend in southwest washington. After finishing Pacific county, I made my way to Vancouver and Bob joined me for this one and we drove our vehicles to the trailhead to spend the evening and get an early start from. When we got to the Stagman Ridge trailhead on Saturday evening, the only other vehicle in the parking lot was one from Wisconsin. We immediately thought ""county highpointer"" - who else from Wisconsin would be at this trailhead? We had hoped to encounter the owner of the vehicle, but alas it's a big place up there, and where there are no trails, it would be very easy to miss each other. By the time we got back to the trailhead, the car was gone. We slept in our vehicles on Saturday night, and got up in time to start hiking at just after 7 AM. The first trail junction was at about 3 miles. We turned left toward the Pacific Crest Trail. The trail climbs sometimes rather steeply to its junction with the PCT. When we reached the PCT, we turned right onto the PCT, and in about 0.4 mile is the junction to the Round the Mountain Trail. Walk a few steps on this trail and turn left, cross country, into Horseshoe Meadow. At this point you can pretty much pick and choose your route. With Bob using a map of the area, he determined the best way to go and I was happy to follow. So we climbed the little ridge to the north of the meadows, then to the east of ""The Bumper"", then on toward the north-northeast, heading toward the west ridge of Mt. Adams. Snow is a big help in avoiding the scree and moveable talus, however this late in the season there was too little snow, and it was rather hard. My boots didn't have a sharp enough edge or tread to provide adequate traction where the snow was somewhat steep and so I made a note to myself, wear different boots next time. The talus moved all over the place and was a major hindrance on this climb. Several times upon stepping on a seemingly stable rock, the boulders on the hillside above stated sliding down toward us, a very disconcerting sensation to say the least. Visions of starting a landslide and having the rocks bury us were best kept from our minds but I remembered a guy on a mountain in utah that was buried by this same type of junk. He had climbed that mountain at least ten times before but maybe the 11th time was not a lucky number for him. Thanks to GPS technology and spending time with the map, we pretty well covered all of the area that would've been a candidate for the highest point (or highest rock). Again, it was unnerving to have the rocks move under you in such a way as you just felt the whole slope was unstable. It turned out that a couple years later, Paul Klenke was in this area and his pictures seem to indicate that the rocks had indeed shifted or slid. Ugh. Others have mentioned that this area would be best done when there is snow cementing the rocks together and I am one who really wholeheartily agrees. Bob made this note in that cohp.org trip report: ""While we were at and just below the HP, we were able to see the upper reaches of the Pinnacle Glacier just northeast of us. The glacier is covered by rocks and dirt all the way from the top to the base of the steep part of the mountain. There is a constant roar over on that glacier. It is reminiscent of the wonderful sound in the North Cascades of water tumbling from high snow and ice fields down the steep hillsides to the roaring stream at the bottom. But this wasn't water, it was constantly falling rock, and lots of it. I suspect that as the sun came around to the west far enough to warm the ice, the junk that had been held in place by that ice would give way as the edge of the ice became too weak to hold it. I'm sure there are other explanations. We couldn't even see it - we could only hear it. Not sure if it was simply out of sight, or if it was too far away to see it with the naked eye. Incredible! That is a VERY unstable mountain, as are all of the Cascade volcanoes."" We had great views of Mt. Rainier, Mt. Hood and Mt. St. Helens from our rocky viewpoint but I will add that you definitely earn it. Once again I will mention that Bob and I covered the whole area of the 8920 contour and also allowed for above and below elevation correction. We did not ever want to come back (although Bob has since re-visited the highpoint liner area from a different trailhead) Bob summed it up well by stating: ""In short, this cohp is a bear. Most folks would probably choose to backpack this one, but we didn't see any water up there. Earlier in the season with snow melting and snow to walk on, this might actually be a rather enjoyable backpack. But you probably won't be able to avoid at least some of the talus and scree, so it would still have its down side. If you're not planning to complete Washington due to other challenges like Rainier or Bonanza or Olympus or Adams or several others, I would suggest avoiding this one. I would especially warn against soloing this highpoint as it would be very easy to injure yourself on this unstable mountain, and there are very few visitors to the west side of Mt. Adams above the trails. "" Our return to our vehicles went relatively fast although we ran into the remains of an old aircraft that had crashed. Bob reported the wreck site to the sheriffs department after we left the area and we found out later on that the wreck had been logged and recorded by the FAA. When we were just about back to the trailhead, it was dark (shorter days in September) and we were spooked by some large crashing noise that came from nearby. Most likely an elk that was spooked by us. The drive home was spent dodging elk and deer on the highway that leads back to the Columbia Gorge. Overall: 17 miles, 5000' elevation gain, 12 hours of hiking. (not including the hour we spent for lunch and searching the liner area). I could sum up the liner area for this county very succinctly: ""This area makes me nervous"" Images View ""This area makes me nervous"" Image Gallery - 25 Images Comments Post a Comment Viewing: 1-8 of 8 lcarreau - Aug 8, 2010 9:31 am - Voted 10/10 About the mountain: I was always intrigued by the west side of Adams.

multi-day,Going for the Gusto: A Two Day Climb on the Torment Forbidden Traverse,"Introduction Boston Basin Trailhead View""I have learned, that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours."" - Henry David Thoreau The Torment Forbidden Traverse is the most extensive rock climbing route I've done to date. While not very technically inclined, it consists of a large quantity of class 4 and low 5th climbing and of course some mid 5th moves. It is said that every mountaineering skill you've learned will be used on this route. Both Mark and I agreed with this statement. From traversing talus, steep trails, glacier travel, rock climbing, loose rock scrambles, steep ledge traversing, down climbing, snow climbing, rappels, wet slabs, snow climbing, getting lost, and a big creek crossing. This route pushed us pretty hard, but we had an awesome time. Plus it was sweet to redo the West Ridge of Forbidden Peak which is listed on the 50 classics of North America. By the end of the trip we arrived exhausted at the car by 2:30 a.m. Day 1: Climbing Mount TormentIt had been several months since I've seen my buddy Mark Straub who is currently living in New York. Due to his work schedule and having to pack we left my house around 12:30 a.m. On the way to the Boston Basin trailhead we both saw a guy walking in the middle of the road with fog all around. I can't fully explain it, but this guy looked almost like a ghost. I relax thinking that it was me just being sleepy. A few seconds later Mark says ""did you see that!?"". I guess you can see new things even after driving through this area a million times. Lets just say it was a weird sight. Any who, we arrived at the trailhead around 3:30 a.m. We decided to sleep in a little due to how late we arrived. Johannesburg with the Moon Climbers Topping out near the CJ Col Cascade Peak North Face Johannesburg Northeast Buttress At about 7:20 a.m. we woke up and got ready for the big day ahead of ourselves. After taking a few more pictures we were on our way up to Boston Basin. I once read in a hiking book that it was rated ""extreme"", I joked about it as we hiked up the trail. We arrived at Boston Basin at 10 a.m. where we snapped a lot of photos of the flowers and surrounding landscape. Mark and I stashed our approach shoes under a rock, I swapped into plastic boots. Johannesburg with Flowers Wildlife of Boston Basin Flowers with Sahale and Boston Edge of Mount Formidable The Trail Up Boston Basin Waterfall Slabs of Forbidden Peak Forbidden Peak from Boston Basin Mount Torment's Southeast Face Sharkfin Tower Mixup Peak's North Face Cascade Valley looking West The traverse over to Torment Basin was straight forward. On one of the talus fields a boulder slipt from underneath me. My leg fell into a slot and so did the boulder. I immediately panicked because I wasn't sure what I did to my leg. After pulling it out of the hole I was relieved that I didn't break it but did have to wait 10 minutes before evaluating it's condition. Felt like such a silly place to get an injury, but at least it would be better here than on the traverse. Eventually I was able to walk on it again and announced that we could proceed. I do admit that it did hurt even a week later on my Johannesburg trip. If another boulder issue like this happened again, I would have had to call it quits. Mark Approaching Torment Basin Looking up Mount Torment's Headwall With a little bit of traversing and scrambling we arrived in Torment Basin at about 12:15 p.m. At the glacier we roped up and proceeded to the hidden gully up to the south ridge of Mount Torment. With limited sleep and feeling hungry I was already feeling fatigued. Before arriving at the bergschrund we took a lunch break and let the party in front of us finish up the loose class 3/4 gully. After lunch we crossed the bergschrund and arrived at the hidden gully. Swapping into rock shoes was a little tricky with a heavy pack and all, but was manageable by putting my pack down into the moat. Then I had to carefully cross by Mark to start the belay. I stayed to the left to avoid rocks that were coming down the gully. Mark arrives at the belay station and belays me up. As the rope gets pulled in I saw a big knot in the rope which took some untangling. I carefully scramble up the class 3/4 gully. Mark with Sahale and Boston Peak Entering the Gully to the South Ridge At the top there was a low 5th class pitch to the belay station. From here Mark sets me on belay and now I'm on lead. We avoided the headwall in the ridge and went left of it. Staying on the south ridge but lightly west. After a few more pitches we arrive to a friendly saddle on the south ridge below the summit. Terrible Tangle Climbing on the South Ridge There is a perfect spot for putting two big packs on. Of course we used it. Being packless made the last part up Torment a lot easier and safer. From here we traversed upwards (right) along some ledges working around the summit. We went from the south ridge to it's southeast side and then finished on the north east side. The true summit is the one on the left (south summit). It felt good to have a light breeze and a late afternoon sun. After making a careful photo exchange by traversing folks back and forth we started the descent.

Mark rappelled first and hopped over the moat. When I rappelled down, I span around a bit due to it being a huge over hang. ""So this is what it's like to be in space"" I joked aloud as I tried not to get out of control. ""Mark, how did you deal with this bergschrund"" I yelled. ""Go to the bottom and just make a jump for it"" Mark replied. He was right, it was a simple swing out jump with having to catch the snow. It was fun to watch one of the other guys swing too far and have to swing back. ""No going back"" I whispered to myself as I looked up the formidable over hanging wall we just rappelled off of. Rappelling onto the Glacier The Beginning of the Traverse My Turn to Rappel Down (Mark) Looking down onto the Taboo Glacier (Mark) After putting things away we traversed around a crevasse and started traversing towards Forbidden Peak. While we traveled along side of a moat there was a crevasse on the other side of it. Mark decided to have us rope up which a belay was set up. Mark took the lead, once the rope ran out we simul climbed. As Mark was traversing on the rocks while I was still on the snow the rope got caught pretty hard on the rocks. I had to down climb into steep slushy snow to get it untangled. I then had to scramble up some dangerous talus to get back up on route. Mark wondered what was going on, ""I had no choice"" I announced as we arrive at a decent bivy spot. The sun was setting and we knew that we might be in trouble if we continued on. So we settled for a flattish rock spot on the traverse. It took a long time to melt snow even with keeping water in the container to speed up the process. After a good round of top romen we got ready for bed. Mark decided to sleep at a separate bivy site to prevent himself from rolling off a cliff in the middle of the night. On my end I faced the slope and had to make a rock pillow. City folks would call it terrible, but it was the best one would find in the area. While looking up at the stars I saw the flicker of thunder in the distance. I would wake up in the middle of the night due to large rock gaps and edges in my back. Evening View of the Inspiration Glacier (Mark) Day 2: Torment Forbidden TraverseIn the morning I made a bowl of cereal using powdered milk. After breakfast we packed our gear and started up the traverse again. After passing around the corner Mark took the lead and we went up some easy 5th class. Morning Ray on Jack Mountain The Edge of Mount Torment My Bivy Spot Mark's Bivy Spot (Mark) Morning View of Eldorado Peak (Mark) View from our Bivy (Mark) At one point I came across a huge loose boulder in the route which left me no choice but to throw it down the mountain below me. As I bumped it down I had to be very careful not to knock it onto myself. Once it started coming down I had to give it a good shove and have it lightly fly over me. The usual explosion of rocks came with it's crashing way down below into the glacier. The next section was a little tricky, while technically we did it unroped, it required much more caution. As we crossed a narrow ledge with heavy packs, I looked down. Normally I'm not afraid of heights but the fact that the pack would catch on the wall made it a bit more dangerous. The next section was a down sloping slab with poor hand holds but was fortunately manageable at a slow speed. Looking Down onto the Forbidden Glacier from the Second Bivy Spot (Mark) Forbidden Peak looking Intimidating (Mark) We arrived at the next bivy spot. Someone pooped right in the middle of the route which both Mark and I stepped in. We both had to clean our rock shoes and my hand. Errrrrrrrr. After what felt like 10 minutes of scrubbing we proceeded to the snow crossing. It looked a bit steep but fortunately there were bucket steps in it to make it more comfortable. We placed our axes in deep where we could and had quality crampons steps. I managed to enjoy it a bit. Looking back at the Steep Snow Traverse (Mark) At the next section Mark led and we traversed down onto the snow. Then we climbed up the snow slope to a nice break spot in the ridge. After resting we traversed onto the south side with a nice class 3 ledge. On the other side we walked along the ridge until it became knifey. Mark proceeded to lead this pitch. At the last part of the traverse I led which was mostly easy going. Rock Edge we Went Around TFT High Point Mark scrambling on the Traverse Approaching Forbidden Peak Yours Truly with Forbidden Peak (Mark) The crux of the entire traverse may have been pulling the rope due to the intense rope drag. On the patio I was pulling until my arms were too tired to pull. Once the rope was pulled in we began our rappel down towards the bottom of the West Ridge of Forbidden Peak. Using the south side ledge we followed it upwards until we arrived at the West ridge. The Patio Looking South at the Ptarmigan Traverse Shadows on Sahale and Boston Cascade Peak and Johannesburg Cosho, Kimtah, Katsuk, and Mesahchie Mesahchie under Gloomy Weather Looking Down the Ridge West Ridge of Forbidden Peak Rappelling Down to the West Ridge It was about 5:00 p.m. and the weather was looking questionable. ""Should we proceed"" Mark asked. I already climbed this route but knew how much it would mean to Mark if we gave it a go. I was pretty sure the weather wouldn't get too terrible. We free soloed the first part of the ridge to save time. Arriving at the air step I forgot how far down it was which one has to build up a little bit of confidence before making the step/jump. ""We are flying up"" I announced. Finally we had to rope up due to a down climb section that would have scared me a little bit unroped. The next two pitches Mark led to speed up the climb. As we get closer to the summit the clouds move in and were already hitting the summit. With a few more moves we arrived on the summit with only a moment to spare. After having a hasty snack we start the rush down the mountain. Gloomy Weather over Cosho Peak and Kimtah Peak Hustling DownThe clouds where blowing in which blocked the views to the south. ""Where are the rap rings?"" I yell in a little bit of anger. Someone took most of them off the mountain! The previous year the raps down where amazing, but this year we ended up having to do a lot of down climbing 4th and low 5th class. Eventually we managed to get back onto the West ridge by traversing a edge of the face. Lucky for us a few rap rings were still there which we were able to do two rappels. We met up with the other group we saw on the Torment Forbidden Traverse which we shared a rope for rapping down. Mark on Rappel Forbidden's Summit (Mark) Racing Down the West Ridge Rappelling Off Forbidden Peak Mount Torment through the Clouds After the last rap we hustled the rest of the way down the west ridge. The air jump was scarier looking than I remember it being. ""How am I going to get across this thing"" I semi joked to myself. After holding my breath I made the step/jump move. After a few more minutes we arrived at the gear stash and put things away. It was getting dark and we had to make as good of time as possible. As I walked down the gully I was reminded of how loose the rock was. When Mark arrived we down climbed to the first rappel station. Just above the rap station I was a bit freaked out because I had to down climb 4th class with a heavy pack while exhausted in plastic boots and high exposure. Mark gave me a ""fall belay"" here which helped me feel calmer for this. Chances of falling where actually quite high considering that I couldn't make very good foot holds. I was relieved as I arrived at the rappel station. I let Mark go down first. As he went down the sun was setting which I took a few pictures due to having a short amount of free time. Eldorado Peak with a Cloudy Atmosphere Down Climbing on the Northwest Face Boston Peak with Evening Light Sahale with a Stormy Atmosphere Johannesburg during Evening Sunset Colors on Sharkfin Tower Sahale and Boston Peak with Evening Light Looking towards Bonanza Peak Red Mountain during Sunset Sunsight Peak during Evening Views to the South Clouding Over From here it was a series of rappels down while trying not to knock down rocks onto each other including the other group. As we went down I became nervous as the atmosphere around us became dark blue. Had to make good time, hold fast, and be very careful. By the end of the last rappel it was night time. We pulled out our head lamps, ice axes, and crampons to down climb the gully. Oh the joys of down climbing snow in the dark. Cascade Peak and Johannesburg getting Covered by Clouds Getting Lost on Waterfall SlabsEarlier in the day I looked down the glacier to make sure we passed through the proper spot. After jumping over a moat we hiked the rest of the way down the glacier. The other team of climbers was ahead going off to the left. It was obvious they hit the big crevasse and could not proceed. We walked over a few small ones but had smooth sailing for the rest of the glacier travel. I thought for sure we were all good to go for getting off the mountain. Once we got off the glacier it was time to navigate the waterfall slabs. There were cliffs underneath of us. I managed to get us a few hundred feet further down by traversing a sketchy edge with water flowing on us with slippery moss. Then we went to the left where we found ice chunks that fell off the glacier with more cliffs below. We went to the middle area where it was a complete headwall. I looked at my camera and found exactly where we were or at least where I believed we were. Unfortunately because of the perspective things were a little different from what they seemed. After heading way to the right the snow ended and we ended up at the edge of another major head wall. Mark proposed going down a steep wet mossy slope with cliffs below. ""Mark, I really don't feel comfortable with this"" I anncounced to Mark. It would have been quite dangerous to go down at the very least. After an hour or so of wondering around in the dark Mark had us go through the left side to see how it would work out. Mark did quite well navigating down the slabs and eventually in to safety. I was so happy to be in Boston Basin. Looking up above I could see way up on the mountain where the other party was lost on the waterfall slabs. Enduring an Exhausting Hike OutWe had our gear stashed under a rock. Fortunately I took a picture of it which I used to give us enough evidence to remember the area of which it was at. After 10 minutes or so of looking around we found them, put them on and continued the hustle down. I was quite pleased when I found the trail. A moment later we crossed a big snow patch and the trail was gone. ""Where is it"" I announced as I looked around for it. I decided to go downwards to meet up with the trail. Eventually we found one which ended up being a fake. The slope ahead looked totally wrong which meant we had to go back up. After doing a diagonal traverse we arrived on what appeared to be the main trail. After walking on it for 10 minutes I realized that it appeared to not be the trail we came up on. It was not as well maintained and had a lot of rocks on it making us slip a bit. After a while I starting thinking ""please let this take us the right way, please let this be the right way"". If it was another fake I knew that we would be stuffed and wouldn't have the energy to make it back down. To our excitement it eventually met up with the main trail. A moment later we arrive at the creek crossing. The creek was raging, I had a hard time believing how much bigger it got. I was so exhausted that when I leaned over with my pack on, I tipped over and did a cheap catch. After a moment of struggling I was able to get back up from being on my face. We did a evaluation of the creek and could not find an easy crossing spot. So we decided to take off our shoes and cross bare foot. I had to use huge boulders to prevent myself from tipping over. The cold water was numbing cold, but we made it through in good time. After crossing the creek we put our shoes and socks back on and carried on down the trail. For a while the traveling was decent until we got to the steep section of the trail. Falling down the trail was a serious possibility. There were some trip spots and lots of dirt being kicked around. We both took back our opinions of the trail not being extreme. It certainly is rated extreme when your tired, going down in the dark, and have a heavy packs on. After a long time of walking down in the dark and a few rests we arrived at the car. It was 2:30 a.m. which we were so excited. ""What an epic trip"" I announced. I was satisfied for a week - until our next big epic Johannesburg. Special thanks to Steph Abegg for her great trip report which gave us some important clues on where to go and confidence of not getting lost. I admit at first glance the instructions left me very intimidated which is why I waited an extra year. But for a good reason.

Your photos get better and better. Imagine how beautiful the views would be if you do this traverse in winter?! Has it seen many winter ascents? Josh Lewis - Nov 14, 2013 8:07 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Great report! Thanks Vitaliy. Keep in mind that some of these photos were taken by Mark Straub. The photos that he took have a (Mark) at the end. But I am trying to improve my photography technique and be very selective about my photos while still attempting to keep up with the quantity I used to use. I wanted to take more on the route itself, but we had to make good time and some spots were difficult to take them at. We both were using SLR sized cameras for all these pictures. A point and shoot would have made it a lot easier. From what I've heard this route has not been done in winter. It would be a huge under taking at the least from what I understand. John Scurlock has taken a lot of nice winter shots of the Traverse during Winter. The West Ridge (top of the photo) has quite a few flutings during winter. It would be stunning at the very least. To see it up close myself in winter would be fantastic. MoapaPk - Nov 13, 2013 5:16 pm - Voted 10/10 Nice Pretty amazing for a kid with Asperger's! ;^) Check grammar though -- ""since I seen""! Josh Lewis - Nov 14, 2013 8:15 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Nice Thanks MoapaPK. All these years I refused to believe that I should give up going for my dreams of being a mountaineer just because of some conditions that I have. Yeah it had some rough edges and hard times, but I believe you don't have to be ""born to be a mountaineer"". Some are made. ;-) I am thankful I had a little help along the way too. I changed ""since I seen"" to ""since I've seen"". Mike Lewis - Nov 13, 2013 11:15 pm - Voted 9/10 Satisfied for a week? Hell! I'd be satisfied for a lifetime! I struggle to comprehend that you do this regularly. Josh Lewis - Nov 14, 2013 8:20 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Satisfied for a week? When given the opportunity for another great climb, I was satisfied until the next climb. So this could mean that the satisfaction could have lasted longer than a week. But Jburg satisfied for a long time! What a beast that thing is. nickmech - Nov 14, 2013 1:13 am - Hasn't voted epic? Nice job. Why do you call all your climbs epic? Josh Lewis - Nov 14, 2013 7:54 pm - Hasn't voted Re: epic? In the heat of the moment when getting off of a mountain one says things that might be a little more intense than they actually were. At the end of the report I was quoting myself. It may not have been classified as an ""epic"" but it was certainly a toughy. Johannesburg however was actually an epic. According to Wikipedia an epic is ""In climbing, an ordinary climb rendered difficult by adverse factors"". That was certainly the case with Jburg.

Josh Lewis - Nov 14, 2013 10:28 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Amazing pictures Thanks Snidely. Climbs like these have recently convinced me that I need to create a online magazine dedicated to awesome ascents. Not just rock climbers, or ice, but various alpine achievements including first ascents. Years ago when I was a kid, I was flipping through a national geographic book and saw a climber on the hanging glacier of Johannesburg. I thought to myself ""that looks pretty rad"". Now that I'm older I hope to bring on the table some of the things that I've seen. There were awesome scenes on the traverse that were for our eyes only. mfox79 - Nov 15, 2013 8:27 pm - Hasn't voted Thanks! That looked like one hell of a journey.

I'll acquaint myself with the glaciers and wild gardens, and get as near the heart of the world as I can."" -John Muir ""This is just what I needed!"" -Sebastian Rosa ""Two Thumbs Way Up! I can never live the adventure of a life time just once!"" -Personal Statement This was an extraordinary adventure, perhaps one of the greatest weeks of my life. Although I had many summit attempts, I certainly was living out the true spirit of mountaineering. Mountaineering to me is about adventure, companionship, and having the time of your life. Every new person I met during this extravaganza was from SummitPost, which I'm always impressed at how the internet has made finding partners much easier than it used to be. Day 1: Checking out Crater Mountain Crater Mountain from the Highway We originally made plans to climb Mount Hardy, but the South Face appeared to have some bush whacking involved which my partners were not to keen about. So instead as an alternative plan we went back West for Crater Mountain. The trail started out nice and easy, although it felt a bit like a jungle from the humid forest environment. After a few miles of hiking we came across a creek crossing which had a bit of a waterfall to the side of it. Joanna did not feel comfortable taking Holly across the creek, so we came up with an alternative plan which was to bush whack up the slope and find a safer crossing. Michael Crossing the Creek After going up about 500 feet we still did not find any decent crossings, so we decided to go up to the water source and cross there. I decided it would be best to follow a small creek up, which to my luck it surprisingly brought us to a lesser brushy area. Traversing the Side of Crater Mountain From here we traversed around to the right of the mountain. I had only briefly looked at a map of the mountain, which I suppose my navigation skills have gotten better at finding the way up. At the top we could see Jack Mountain, as well as many other North Cascade Peaks. Eldorado and Tricounti Peak Yours Truly with Jack Mountain We wondered whether we should find the trail or take the way we originally came. Considering we would run into the same problem as when we came in we came back the same way we came in. At the trailhead we decided it would be a good place to camp at and enjoy the stars while I cooked hot chocolate for my brother Michael. Day 2: Driveway ButteIn the early morning we could hear it raining outside which we all decided to sleep in late considering that we would not want to climb anything big if the weather was bad. Fortunately weather forecasts for the eastern Cascades were looking decent, so we went over Washington Pass for Driveway Butte. The weather here was perfect, light passing clouds casting cool shadows over the mountains. The beginning of Driveway Butte has all sorts of wild flowers covering the mountain side. To the South we could see the Gardeners as well as Silver Star Peak as well as a few others. Joanna and Holly in a Field of Flowers Driveway Butte Panorama Looking West A ways up we traveled through a burnt forest which in this area of the mountain there were no more flowers. Unlike most adventures, our turn around time was based on when the store in Mazama closed which was 7 p.m. The walk to the summit of Driveway Butte was relaxing, although with good views. We went down the mountain in decent time, while making it to Mazama just before the store closed. From here we went back West for Stetattle Ridge the next day. Sunset over the Ridge Day 3: Heading Back to Stetattle RidgeWe woke up early this time for Stetattle Ridge which has at least 6,000 feet of elevation gain which meant we were in for a full days work. The trail this time was much friendlier, hardly any fallen over trees and a few flowers on the way. A Tiger Lily on the Trail As we curved on the mountain we had to cut off the trail and onto the ridge. Unlike the past two times I been here it was now summer which we had to bush whacking through, I now understand why most do this one during winter time. Heading off Trail After going through a bit of bush wracking the ridge opened up and we came onto familiar grounds. Joanna did not like what she saw at the crux because it was melted out and was a class 3 rock scramble, fortunately we managed a way around it to the left in the woods to get around it and back onto the ridge. From here we walked out for a ways on the ridge to get some of the best views of the area. The Crux We avoided Cornice Break Off It's as Steep as it Looks Michael Getting His Alpine On Michael with Rainbow Clouds At around 4 p.m. we finally decided it was best to start heading back. After getting off of the upper ridge we got a bit lost on the way down, which we had to carefully descend in the woods. ""I'll bet we'll get out of this mess in a few minutes"" I announced excitedly because I heard water noises below. ""Alright, if we get out of this within the next couple of minutes I'll buy you guys ice cream!"" I heard. Sure enough we found the trail, and they kept there word. This was a very good deal I thought as I enjoyed the fireworks on the car ride home. Ptarmigan Off Trail Day 4: Heading up to South TwinOn the Night of July 4th I knew that if I wanted this line of adventure to continue on, I had to contact Eric as soon as possible. I gave him a call, he said him and Sebastian were climbing South Twin and Mount Shuksan. Immediately I was on the trip as well, which even though it was the night of forth July which most people around were lighting off fire works, I had a trip to prepare for. After packing up my gear I managed to get a few hours of sleep, which Eric picked me up in the morning to meet up with Sebastian (aka Sebas). I found Sebas to be an interesting character, when looking at our route on a map he would grab a piece of grass to use as a pointer and say ""See zis Ridge, we will be taking zis guy here"". Both Eric and Sebas were easy going, and were great company. After figuring out all the plans we left Bellingham and on to South Twin. We decided to go for the East Side of South Twin up to Wiseman Lake for our route. Twin Sisters on the Way ""I can see why they call you Sebas!"" Eric announced while the car went over a bump while driving swiftly down the road to South Sister. ""This is nothing compared to the old me a few years back"" Sebas replied. The drive it self was a bit exciting on its own with all the bumps and curves in the road. When we got to the trailhead Sebas said ""Alright, I'll drive a bit more gentile on the ride back"". But I gotta admit it was kinda fun. Although I love my boots, they unfortunately give me blisters. I know it's not my feet because with other boots on long over night trips I don't get blisters on my heels like I do with these ones, so I finally decided to bring approach shoes. This turned out to be a great idea. Starting out the hike we immediately came to the river crossing which the bridge was washed out. Fortunately there was two very nicely placed logs to cross on, which made things a lot easier. Crossing the River The trail up the forest was in relatively in good shape, although with a tree slide area. After passing a small creek we then forked left off the trail and onto the boulder field. From here it was a bit of scrambling up trying to figure out the way to Wiseman Lake. This route seemed not very well known, although fortunately Sebas had been there before. Above us were cliffs with a class 3 access point, which we carefully ascended. Sebas Leading the Way Eric going through Slide Alder One of the Class 3 Sections Going up the Snow Slope Getting Close to Lake Wiseman The Sun Setting over the Twin Sisters As the sun set, Mount Baker and the Black Buttes were looking fabulous. We could see pinks and reds across the sky, and on the other side of the horizon the moon setting. At lake Wiseman we set up camp quickly before it got dark. We all set out for our choirs, I was the water guy, while Sebas and Eric did the cooking. After coming back with the 10 liter water jug, it was time to have dinner. Sunset on the Black Buttes with Mount Baker Alpenglow on Mount Baker Setting up Camp During Sunset The Moon Setting Sun Colored Hills Alpenglow Rocks After having dinner we got warm in our sleeping bags, and Eric brought his book. Never before had I found it so interesting listening to someone read, I would hear out bursts of laughter and ""Oh that's too funny!"". After this we got some nice rest, unfortunately we slept in a bit too much... Day 5: Attempting South TwinWe woke up a little after the sunrise which we cooked breakfast and got ready for the day ahead of ourselves. We started out hiking around Lake Wiseman, up a saddle and then we ended up loosing a lot of elevation to go down to the lower basin in front of South Twin. From here we roped up in case we got onto the glacier at any point. Heading out in the Morning Sebas with Mount Baker Eric Approaching South Twin As we ascended the slope, we realized more and more that going this late in the day was a bad idea. Above us we could see a large snow break off right along our planned pathway, Eric was not feeling too good about the idea. As we climbed higher the snow got steeper, we had to cross a bit of a narrow section in the snow field to cross onto the glacier. To my left was a moat, and to my right was a cliff which I made sure to make each step nice and solid. But we all realized that the snow had softened up significantly, and that snow/rock fall hazard was becoming more evident. So we made a group decision and decided to turn around. No hard feelings, after all we needed to get down in time to get our permit for Mount Shuksan. We quickly hiked back to camp, packed our gear and went down the mountain. Coming back down the way we came in was not quite ideal considering the class 3 scrambles with heavy back packs on, but when trying a new route down we ended up at a very steep section. So Sebas set up an anchor and we repelled down. Looking Down Below Repelling Down the Forest Besides the bush whacking to the trail it was pretty much smooth hiking to the car. From here we got to the ranger station about 5 minutes or so before they closed. In a sense we were lucky we did not get the summit. Day 6: Getting Sketched out on Mount ShuksanOn the ride to Mount Shuksan we all were wondering what route we should take up it, for the longest time the North Face seemed like it would be the one. When we got to the ""parking lot"" (it was more like a grassy pull out) we had a great view of the route. Looking up at it I just couldn't help thinking ""wow, this is quite the route"". I was intimidated looking up at the face, not quite sure what I was up against. Mount Shuksan's North Ridge After re-thinking over the plans we finally decided that it would be best to for the Fisher Chimneys because at least then we would not have to go through massive bush whacking. So we drove on over to the Mount Baker Ski area, which to our luck did not require a Northwest forest pass (I left my pass at home on accident). At the parking lot this is where we met up with Ski. From the beginning he was a entertaining guy with lots of funny things to say and amazing plans like climbing the North Ridge of Mount Baker. He convinced our group into making this a 1 day trip, which I agreed with because Eric said there was a 10% chance of rain, and many people from the Northwest know that the weather is hard to predict around here. So when you know things could get bad, you gotta make sure you avoid the bad weather as fast as possible. While cooking dinner and have good talks, suddenly a cat came by. Never in all my mountaineering have I seen a cat already in the mountains come to me asking for attention. I gave it a good petting, washed my hands with snow, and then went on to get some rest for the morning ahead. Mount Shuksan with a Cat The Messy Parking Lot At 1:18 a.m. I woke up a few minutes before the alarm in anticipation, I now could not sleep and had to get ready for the climb ahead. After packing up all our gear we started out for Mount Shuksan. At first we had a pathway in the snow which soon disappeared, around Austin Pass we were slightly confused on which way to go. Fortunately I could make out Mount Shuksan's shadow and figure out exactly what valley we had to go down, after all I been here before. We lost a good 1,000 or so feet going down the valley from the high point we were on. Finding the way to Ann lake was better than I had expected in the dark, near the lake we went through a gap section in the cornice covered ridge which was a friendly hike to. From here this is when the trip started getting more interesting. Mount Shuksan in the Morning Ski and Sebas near Lake Ann From here we put on our crampons, harness's, and helmets. Eric offered to give Sebas the map because he considered turning around because he did not want to slow down there climb, but Sebas convinced him to continue and to keep the map. After heading over the hill we got a good view of the route ahead, for most of the night it had been clear, although now a few clouds could be seen on the horizon. Mount Shuksan had a lenticular cloud over the summit which already had us wondering if the weather would hold up. Lenticular Forming High up on Shuksan Looking up at the Lenticular Cloud over Shuksan We traversed a bit of a steep zone near the cliffs on Shuksan, I found out very quickly that the snow had not fully froze that night and was semi-loose. After down climbing a section I looked behind me which I could see a dark cloud head wall from the North to the South. Bad weather was inevitable at this point. It was a moment that was to beautiful, yet a bit frightening. To the left I could see Mount Baker glowing from the sunrise which stole my attention for a few moments. Sunrise on Mount Baker Alpenglow on Sherman Peak Storm Coming In The Sun Rise Looking West After one last slope traverse we reached a section where we had to go straight up. It had a bit of a rock section, which they climbed first without too much difficulty. Ski made a snow bollard to use for belaying us up. To get the rope down he attached a large stick to it, the stick looked as if it was going to land on us, but fortunately went down right where he threw it. First Eric went up, then me. This was the first time that I have climbed on rock with crampons. I thought of a scene from Touching the Void which even though I was roped up, it may have been a false sense of security (who knows, perhaps it would have held well). When unclipping from the rope Eric and I did not feel comfortable on the slope we were on. Below us was the rock wall we went up with a moat at the bottom and more steep snow below that. After scrambling 20 feet on exposed loose rocks, Eric finally announced ""Guys, I'm turning around. I don't feel comfortable with this kind of mountaineering"". We all understood, in that very second I almost said ""I'm going down with him"" but then looked back up the mountain and thought ""he will make it back down alright, you still have a shot at Mount Shuksan"". It was right then that I was battling my guilty conscience against what I should do. What would Eastking do? For sure he would do the right thing and make sure that Eric would not go down alone. Sebas and Ski were already ahead by this point which I figured ""I'll base my decision on if I can catch up to them in time"". Just as I was heading up on the snow slope I had my ice axe nicely plunged in and I tripped on one of my prussik cords that I thought was tucked away. This put me in a instant panic. I caught myself, untangled my crampon from the cord, and had to take a quick rest. I had nearly fallen down the mountain which would have been very serious. It was right in this moment that I figured ""It just wasn't meant to be, this is not worth risking everything for."" It was right here that I had made one of my greatest mountaineering decisions of all time. For obvious reasons too! Heading up towards the Wall Climbing up the Rock Section Just because we were turning around didn't mean we were safe yet. We had some steps we had to kick to get a ways down the snow field which there was a repel ring to the left. As usual I found myself down climbing snow that was not ideal. The gloves I was wearing were not the greatest which my hands were becoming very cold. As I climbed across the slope I would bang them together only to have regained enough heat in them to have what many climbers call the screaming barfies. My hands felt horrendous by this point, but I knew I had to keep climbing, the sun had already risen and a storm was on it's way in. I knew that my ice would not save me on this slope which is why I took my time carefully kicking in steps. When I got to the repel anchor, Eric went first, and then myself. From here travel was much friendlier. It's always an amazing feeling knowing that your going to get off the mountain alive. Clouds Building up on Mount Shuksan Swirling Clouds over Mount Shuksan The Cornice we had to go Around Eric heading down the Mountain As we hiked down the cloud deck came down as well which above I could see a swirling cloud. ""I sure hope they turn around soon"" I told Eric. We rushed down to the basin, back over Austin Pass and then down to the car. We got back to the car just in time! At first it started out as a light rain, but a few minutes later it was pouring down rain. It was a moment of irony, I had ran out of water and was very thirsty, yet I did not want to hike a mile or more to a lake because I did not want to get completely soaked if we had the possibility of staying overnight. By Day 6 My feet were Getting Blistered After sleeping for 3 hours I woke up which Eric figured they would be back at 3 p.m., I knew better that it would take much longer. I just couldn't help worrying for them. When hours more passed I spoke with someone in the parking lot which they told me that I should call search and rescue by 9 p.m. While sitting in the car I could hear an avalanche off of table mountain which assured me that the snow conditions up on Shuksan were not good. I knew that one of two things were happening. 1: One (or both) of them got injured up on the mountain from a fall, avalanche, ect. 2: They were going through some crazy mountaineering. I had spent hours looking outside just wondering how they were, I had feelings of regret that perhaps I should have told them that a storm was coming and that conditions were not ideal. They also had minimal gear on and did not have a map. This was because when we separated Eric had the map which Sebas already was a ways up the slope by the time Eric announced his plans. At 7 p.m. a van came by which to my amazement Ski and Sebas made it down alive! ""Halfway down the White Salmon Glacier, the tracks that Sebas and I had been following suddenly disappeared into thin air. We were on a massive rock outcropping overlooking what we could only hope was where the White Salmon river drainage basin- however, in our white prison, all we could make out off that desolate cliff was a lifeless void in which we would have to descend further in. After probing around in earnest for the our boot-track lifeline, I informed Sebas that I had some, eherm, buisness to attend to. He plodded away in that forsaken fog and I skirted the cliff for a better view to do my business with. After finishing, I was just in the process of lashing my harness on when I heard a sound I will never forget. Through the fog, somewhere, I heard Sebas yell ""WATCH OUT!!!"" What I am now going to describe will never come close to the amount of fear that Sebas and I experienced in that next minute. Through that desolate fog came the first of them- rock boulders, ice refrigerators and every medium in between came rushing down with the speed of ballistic missiles and the sound of a banshee. I was petrified. I couldn't react. I was exposed- I had nothing to hide behind. All of my close call in life had finally caught up with me. I clutched my ice tool tightly and faced my attacker in wonder at his power. Finally, the gears of my mind succumbed to the adrenaline dump I was experiencing. I ambled to a snow prow that was somehow deflecting some of the ice missiles, despite its minute size. I hastily anchored myself in and watched in absolute horror as a human-sized boulder crashed down right where Sebastian was shouting down at me. At that moment my heart sank. He was dead. He had to be. What now? What now. ARE YOU OKAY I yelled this right as the final volley came to a rest. I was shaking so badly my crampons were skittering across the rock I was standing upon. YES!! I'm OKAY. Oh man, I was so happy to hear he had made it, I could have cried. I sprinted across the debris field to embrace my friend. He was shaking as bad as I was!!! The devastation was awesome. Branches and brush were crushed and crumpled about him. We shared mutual stories of near death! It was all too real right then. It took us several minutes to calm down enough to resume our search for the tracks. We had to get home."" -Ski's account of the Intense Climb (The next few Photos by Sebas and Ski) Ski on the Summit of Mount Shuksan Escaping the Fisher Chimneys Getting Lost in the Woods ""Dude! You wouldn't believe what we went though today"" Sebas announced. When Ski told the story of there climb I felt as though held in suspense just being a listener of it. They said it was some of the most scary climbing they ever did. They went from one moment worrying about steep snow slopes to having avalanches come between them and many other crazy events. A few minutes later they quickly wanted out of the Mount Baker area which we all hurried over to Bellingham to enjoy some nice warm pizza! It was a great celebration to a crazy day! Day 7: Return to Crater Mountain and BeyondI got home at 4:30 a.m. in the morning which left me enough time to back up for the next trip and get a few hours of sleep. In the morning Craig picked me up and we went over to the North Cascades. ""Final Round"" I whispered to myself on the car ride there. When we got to the trail head it was 2:00 p.m. The trail this time had more vegetation over grown than it did before. At the big creek crossing we had to take off our footwear, the water was very cold, although manageable. The trail now had water running through it, which meant that it was time to ditch my approach shoes and swap to boots (Boy did I miss those shoes, my boots continue to make my blisters worse each trip). The trail got a little trickier to find by this point due to the heavy snow patches, but fortunately I knew the general direction which was just enough to be able to find the trail every 2 minutes (we would temporary lose it over and over). As we traversed around the mountain I saw my old glissade tracks from days earlier, which finding the high point by now was much easier. At the high point we decided it was the best place to put up our camp. Right after I set up the tent I took off my boots and socks to air them out, just as I was taking off my last sock I hear a ""Josh! The Tent!!!"". A gust of wind blew it away from us and continued to make it start flying down the mountain. Immediately I instantly got up and started running for it which 150 feet or so by our camp site it got caught on a rock. You could tell that it only had a few more seconds before it would continue to blow down the mountain which literally right next to the rock was a cliff it would have went down. I caught it just in time and grasped it as hard as I could. I then brought it back to camp. Craig Heading up A Nice Place to Camp The View to the East The spot which I finally caught my tent After setting our gear inside the tent I finally felt the impact and scratches on my feet from running on rocks bare foot. Looking outside our tent we could see more clouds building up which I figured the weather would remain bad the next day. Fortunately our luck was in... Day 8: Heading up to High Camp on JackIn the morning it was a bright sunny day with little wind on the tent. ""Josh, you gotta come see this"" Craig told me excitedly as I was starting to wake up. Outside I could see that we were above the clouds, Jack mountain as well as a few others were also in view. I now was excited because this meant that it was going to be a good day. Craig with Jack Mountain Above the Clouds The View Above the Clouds Jack Mountain with the Lake Below Morning Clouds on Crater Mountain We packed up our gear and started the descent towards Jack Mountain. There was a little bit of scrambling down to get to the lake. At the lake this was a great place to filter water for what we had ahead of us. After filling up water, we traversed the lower section of Crater Mountain. At the next pass we had to go all the way down into the Jerry Lake's basin and then all the way back up another hill. Good thing mountaineering is my pleasure. Craig Filtering Water Traversing the bottom of Crater Mountain The Way to Jack Mountain After climbing over another saddle we could finally see the whole view of Jack Mountain. We now had another 1,000 feet to go down. ""Wow this mountain sure has a lot of up and down"" I told Craig, he replied ""And to think we have about 2,500+ for the way back!"". So once again we went down into another basin which finally we were on the foot of Jack Mountain! From here it was a work out to get to Camp 2 which took another 1.5 hours or so of hiking up. At about 7,000 feet high we set up our camp, this time putting our gear in right away to make sure that the tent would not blow away. Jack Mountain with Clouds Rising The Views to the South While sitting at camp a chipmunk visitor came to our camp, which at first my thoughts were ""oh how cute"", but a little while later he bit into my bag of food which was limited. I was forced to scare it away which normally I hate to do with wildlife, especially one as cute as this guy. For the rest of the after noon Craig cooked up food and melted up snow using his black coat to help melt the snow in bottles on a rock because we were low on stove fuel. Looking up at Jack Mountain I was a bit intimidated by the cliff bands and the steep snow gullies further up. I heard that the rock part was class 3/4 which at first I had a hard time believing until I heard about that we could not see the gully we were going up. Sneaking into Our Camp Oh So Cute! This guy is Grabby After having dinner I went inside the tent to rest up, which I rubbed my noise. At first I noticed a few drops of blood coming out, and before I knew it, it was leaking like blazes. I pressed it against my knee to keep as much pressure on it. Unfortunately even that was not enough which it then soaked that spot of my pants in blood as well as my thermal pants. ""Craig. Craig, do you mind sparing me some toilet paper"" my voice was muffled from having to press against my knee. ""I thought you just went a little while ago"" Craig yelled back. ""No, not for that, I have an issue on my hands"". Craig came in the tent which he immediately handed me the paper which I used to prevent as much blood loss as possible. I spent about 20 minutes holding it until finally it hardened enough to sustain itself and I could make slow movements again. I then had to take my shell pants off and wash off my face with snow as well as a few other things. Fortunately after this things became uneventful and we soon got some rest for the climb up Jack Mountain. Day 9: Making a Attempt, and Going back Home!We woke up at 4:00 a.m. in the morning which I had oat meal and a quick snack before the climb. After walking to the snow area we put on our helmets, crampons and our ice axes. The sunrise to the Northeast was very impressive which there were reds, purples, and oranges. A Beautiful Sunrise on Jack Mountain I immediately was already feeling like this was becoming exciting fast. To my left was a very steep slope and a drop off beyond that, when I got onto the ice I then started to get a little scared. Normally in mountaineering when dealing with a steep icy traverse I usually kick in steps, but there is no way we would be able to climb the mountain in time if we did that. So we had to make sure every step was solid on the ice. There was no kicking in steps, the ice axe did not plant in, and there was no margin for error. I was actually thankful of the idea that when we come back that the snow would soften up here making this part much easier. I normally hate soft snow on steep slopes, especially after being on Mount Shuksan. The Steep Slope Below The Sunrise on the Peaks to the South Alpenglow on Jack Mountain As we traversed the slope the snow slightly softened up which when I pounded hard enough I could get my ice axe in. This made me feel so much better, now I felt as though I could travel more safely, although sometimes I could not get it in on some spots. We decided to avoid a steep section by going to to the moat for a little bit, when pounding in the ice axe I felt like I had to be a Jack Hammer to get it in. It was hard work to pound the axe in after every movement on the slope, but it was better than not having it in. Looking Below me from the Moat At the moat we then traversed along side it for a while until the upper section became steep again. At this point I was ahead of Craig which I decided to go along the side one of the many mini gullies on the mountain. I was now pounding in steps hard because I was not on a ideal slope, every time I rested my knee on the slope I would make a big blood stain in the snow from all the blood the previous day that got on my thermal pants. Well at least this helped clean it off for me. Anyways as I climbed higher I could feel myself growing weaker, I had already gone too far up this to down climb it. Suddenly above me I could see ice chunks coming down right next to me from way above. I quickly looked around at all my surroundings and realized I was in a rock fall spot. I had to focus less on good footing and more on speed now. I felt as though the clock was ticking and I had to get out of this spot as soon as possible. As I neared the top of the ice gully there was a mini water fall above which froze over parts on the snow in front making it very difficult to plant in my axe. I decided when I could finally make it into the snow gully itself I quickly traversed and got onto the rocks. I was relieved that I was now out of the most dangerous part of the face. Although I was still in a rock fall hazard zone, before I was in a position which if I saw rocks tumbling I would either have to let them hit me or go sliding down the mountain in dangerously high speeds. Class 3/4 Section Above my Turn Around Spot The Route I took Up    Once I took a rest I heard Craig yelling back to me from way below ""Josh... (muffled voice)"". I had a hard time hearing him because of the water fall near by me distorting his voice. Turns out he was yelling home over and over, I would yell back ""What was that, I can't hear you"". Then he yelled back ""Lynnwood"". I immediately knew what this meant, it was time to back down which I carefully down climbed a different way from when I came up and down a much friendlier rock scramble down. Then I down climbed snow which had softened up a bit by now. Craig made a good choice here, the snow conditions were turning bad pretty fast. For much of the trip down climbing was at least as hard as climbing up hill, but now it suddenly became much easier and even a bit fun. I was getting a adrenaline rush from it, when doing it in such fast speeds it makes you feel more alive. Now I knew that if I fell I would not get injured which was a relief, although it was still steep below. Craig had short spiked crampons which he said a few times he had to catch himself. After kicking in some nice steps we eventually traversed over for a hour and off of the South Face. I then took off my crampons and helmet and dashed to camp. When I finally got to sit and relax I couldn't help but keep laughing at the thought that I had lived out such a tremendous adventure. You have to live it to know what it's like. I did not one bit regret turning around and not making the summit, after all I feel as though we lived out what true mountaineering is about. Myself on the lower South Face Down Climbing From here we started the long descent back home after packing up our gear. Fortunately the glissades down the mountain were very good, but then it was back to the up hill game again which we had to gain 1,000 or so feet to get up the next saddle. We then down climbed the soft snow which at the bottom we once again came across another glissade zone. Crater Mountain Reflection At Jerry Lakes Craig filtered water for the rest of the way home, drinking fresh water again was very refreshing. All around I could see cloud build up which had me a bit worried, Craig said her heard thunder in the distance. As we traversed Crater Mountain we could see rain clouds to the north, and even Jack Mountain now had dark clouds hovering over it. Above Crater Mountain I could see a anvil like cloud forming, but fortunately we never got caught in any bad weather. On the way back to camp 1, we took a longer route thinking it would be a lesser slope, this turned out to be a minor mistake. Once we got to the ridge we hoped for a way around the mountain, unfortunately there were just cliffs in the way to the access to the other side. So we then had to go up and over the hill, but at least this was the last time we had to go up hill. Stormy Atmosphere over Jack Mountain Clouds Building over Crater Mountain Thunder Clouds Building in the East Spider on the Snow At the top of the hill we had one more round of glissading, and then it was time to find the trail. Our foot prints had melted out significantly to the point where even if you were looking at them you sometimes wouldn't even know it. Once we found our prints we followed them down the trail for a ways. Suddenly at one section they disappeared which had both of us wondering, after looking around in the woods for about 10 minutes we finally gave up and started heading in the general direction of where it might be. As we were going over brush and fallen over trees I started to worry about missing the trail, so I had us take a right and then down. Fortunately this was the right way, in fact it was almost perfect because when we got onto the trail we got to the spot where my approach shoes were. The rest of the way down the mountain was a nice trail back down to the car. One of the best things about ending a hike I always say is taking off your socks. My feet by this point were very blistered to the point where I was hobbling the next day. ""What an adventure!"" I whisper to myself as I fall asleep on the car ride home.

As for Shuksan, although I very much wanted to continue with the climb, I knew it would be a dangerous under taking. Even what I did was dangerous which I nearly stripped on one spot. I'm glad to hear your trip worked out just fine on Shuksan. I'll have to return one of these days. billisfree - Jul 17, 2011 8:47 am - Hasn't voted Great Stuff Thanks for sharing with us.

I think it's really good that you are cautious with summits and new technical terrain. It's real wisdom to learn at your own pace. I can tell you really love the Cascades because you aren't afraid of bushwhacking, obscure routes and deep forest. Looking forward to your missives from August! Josh Lewis - Jul 24, 2011 2:13 am - Hasn't voted Re: Unique perspective Thanks Michael. Just a few hours ago I got home from another 4 day North Cascade Extravaganza which now I still have 3 more climbing days ahead of me. My feet on the other hand are wanting rest. As the quote at the start of my trip reports say, getting down is the most important when mountaineering. I'm ambitious for climbing, but I very much value my life and do not like going beyond what is necessary to have a good time while being safe. As for bush whacking, I'm used to it by now ever since going through Mount Zekes. When I'm done climbing I have more stories to share.

single-day,The Point of No Return: A Frightening Climbing Experience,"Introduction ""When you're safe at home you wish you were having an adventure; when you're having an adventure you wish you were safe at home"" -Thornton Wilder ""A sense of uncertainty that is potentially fatal is what makes climbing an adventure. Anything less is just working out"" -Jim Bridwell This was one of the most frightening climbing experiences I have ever had. My brother and I had to put our mountaineering skills to the test using what we could to get out with our lives. There are climbs were you anticipate danger and those that you think would be nothing more than a simple scramble up. I had under estimated the dangers, the time it would take, but most importantly the mountain. I hope never in my wildest dreams to ever climb anything like this again. I had seen Mount Stickney for years from my roof top which my brother and I felt like this was a mountain that had to be climbed. The best weather day happen to fall on the darkest day of the year making any attempts be done in speedy time. After making careful observations using photographs and google earth I found a steep gully that went up Stickney's South West Face. This appeared to be an unclimbed route which I've always wanted to get a first ascent of a new route up a mountain. But I got more than what I bargained for. Aproaching StickneyWe had a late start because I had to put money onto my bus card, making for a 9:30 a.m. start. The fact that we had breakfast at the last second I had forgotten to bring my ice axe which later ended up being a big deal. After riding a few buses we arrived at the city of Gold Bar at 11:09 a.m. which we immediately hopped on the bikes towards the Wallace Falls trailhead. As I was riding I noticed that I was getting a lot of friction due to my back tire being partly flat. My brother decided to let me use his bike and told me ""don't break my bike"" with a smile. I guess one could call me the Mr. Accident of gear because I'm well known for accidentally breaking gear whether it be a zipper or even an ice axe. Near the trailhead we started biking up a hill. As I was pedaling the chain on the bike suddenly snaps completely making the bike unusable. So much for mountain bikes being able to bike up a small hill. My brother was quite disappointed and used it as a scooter for the rest of the way. We stashed our bikes in the bushes and started jogging on the trail. After getting a bit soar we had to slow down to a speed walk which was still tiring. Exactly an hour from when we got off the bus we arrived at the upper Wallace Falls which I consider that we made good time. Running through the Woods Wallace Falls Middle Falls After a short hike up hill we were on the road that goes towards Wallace Lake. A ways before the lake we took a right turn which follows an abandoned forest road that has some fallen over trees on it. 2.5 miles later we were uncertain of where the route actually was considering that the woods were dense in this area. Michael Climbing over Fallen Trees After passing a old creek drainage I decided that it was time to start heading up. If it was the wrong one, it would be obvious after a few hundred feet. As we hike though the woods the route starts coming into view. Entering the Gully North Side of Mount Zekes Light Clouds coming Over Scrambling up the Start of the Gully The gully started out as a light scramble over rocks and dirt, eventually ending up on snow. We decided that it was best if we put on our crampons for better traction on the snow field which went up the rest of the way of the gully. There was a bit of going back and forth involved with navigating the gully. But for the most part it was a decent gully on the lower section. Michael Hiking up the Gully As we started approaching the upper part of the gully the snow got deeper in places, but did not require snowshoes. When looking up it seemed as though we could top out within 20 minutes. Boy was that a under estimation of the route... Looking up the Gully Climbing into Scary TerrainIt was now late in the day which now we had to make speedy time if we were to complete this route. The gully suddenly became much steeper which we should have turned around right then. We figured that perhaps this was some sort of crux and that after that section we could get to the trees and scramble up to the top of the ridge. A little ways into the snow climb we encountered a section I call ""The Hour Glass"" which is a narrow section of rock and snow having just enough room for one to climb past. The snow climbing started requiring several kicks in the snow/ice in order to be able to some what climb this safely. My brother Michael when he climbed in the hour glass had to climb into a moat just to proceed further. There was a mix of excitement and fear while climbing though. Looking up the Hour Glass Climbing up the Hour Glass After the Hour Glass things eased up a bit but every step still required much attention of kicking and good placements. I saw a rock section ahead which I was delighted that it seemed like the way out of the gully. Ironically it probably would have been better if we stayed in the steep gully later on. Looking down I knew that I broke the number one rule of mountaineering which is to never climb up something that you cannot down climb. Climbing on the Upper Section of the Gully Once we came close to the rocks we started to climb up onto the left side of the gully in hopes that things would start easing up. Things didn't, in fact it got steeper and scarier as we continued on. I soon started to realize that we were climbing ourselves into a trap. There was no going down because the sun was almost setting and the ice was starting to freeze over making our situation more serious. The kicks started requiring at times up to 20-30 kicks per step and with some of them more which was time consuming and exhausting. The terrain was looking so horrendous that I started wishing that I had never went on this adventure. Climbing towards the Ledges Near the top of where we were climbing there was a cliff which Michael decided he wanted to climb to the right of it. The end section of his plans looked terrible for me because I had no ice axe and the possibility of the ice being thin would be incredibly dangerous. The fact that I had small crampon spikes made the situation worse, although certainly better than nothing. I decided that for myself it would be best to try and traverse under the cliff using the ledges. The climb onto the cliff ledges was more dangerous than I had anticipated, the rock was loose making it so every step had to be carefully planned out. I found a ledge that I could finally get a drink on and take a few pictures (I know, pictures during a time like this. When I get nervous and have a spot to sit down on and rest, taking pictures help calm me down). I set down my pack on the ledge that had just enough room for it to stay stable which I scrambled the last part. At the top of the ridge I was horrified to find that there was nothing but steep couloirs below me and cliffs above me. There was no where to go, I suddenly felt trapped on terrain that was beyond my control. I seriously considered climbing a loose class 4 section that I might not have been able to down climb, but went against it because this was not the place to find out if one could proceed. Evening to the South Mount Stickney's Summit Block Sun Setting over Trees Looking West During Evening Mount Index during Evening Mount Rainier during Evening Looking Down Below Topping out at the Wrong Place (All further interest in Photography was lost due to heavy exposure) It was getting dark which I yelled to my brother who faintly heard me though the winds. He told me that he had topped out and was safe which in that sense I was glad. I yelled out several times asking if there was any way on the top of the ridge. My brother told me that he cried when he heard this because he knew that there was nothing. He yelled back ""No"" which I was terrified. Many people would have broken down in tears in the position I was in. I would have myself except that it goes against the rules of survival which is keep your cool when in a perilous situation. I couldn't believe my situation at first, it seemed so unreal to have to go through what I did next. I began going across what was the scariest traverse I have ever had to do. Many times when I went to go make a step the rock would go tumbling down the mountain. I first had to travel under a vertical rock with hardly any place to grip onto. I'm not entirely sure how I was able to pull it off which this was the place that I had to put all my mountaineering skills to the test. If there was a time to make sure you do everything right. This was it! I began getting into deep prayers for guidance of where to place my next move. In some places even when trying to hold my cool I became very shaky in my legs. The dehydration was starting to wear in making it so that I had cramps when ever I made a long step or had to kick in loose snow on ledge spots. When your in a desperate situation you come to find that you can do things you never quite thought you would have been able to do other wise. There came a section were it appeared as though there was no good holds and no way to traverse any further. I felt my heart racing and was looking all around for anything to grab onto, anything that would hold. The only way to proceed was some cheap step move that barely held me which before doing it you start having thoughts like ""if this doesn't hold, well I guess than it was my time anyways"". It felt as though it was a miracle to be able to get past that section. It was becoming quite dark making it hard to see. There would be times were I would have to dig snow out of my way and others were I had to dig rocks out of my way. After one last sketchy rock section I managed to scramble over to a tree hanging over a cliff. I was now able to finally put some layers on over my t-shirt and put on my head lamp. My brother was above me now which he did help kick many steps, but there was a section between him and I that he was too scared to climb. I finally announced ""Michael... I'm scared. In fact, scared is a under statement to what I am feeling right now"". Michael gave back this look of worry which he knew I had one last sketchy section to climb though. It took me a few minutes to find the courage for me to continue on with the climb. The snow became harder making it both more strenuous to kick in steps and less effective when I had the steps in. I was cramping up making me have to wait until I recovered. After what seemed like a long time I finally managed to make it to my brother which he handed me the ice axe to use for the rest of the section. The Long Way Home""Michael, let's not ever do anything like that again"" I told Michael. He relied ""Agreed"". We still had one last some what dangerous section that required a Z shaped format to down climb which I thank my brother for kicking in the steps for. Once we got past this part, the rest of going down was all safe, but not easy. Looking at the time it was 6 p.m. It had take over an hour to travel a couple hundred feet. I knew by this point that there was no hopes for us making it to the bus in time. It took us 12 hours of traveling through the dark to get back to Gold Bar. Sometimes we got a bit lost and at others had to go back up hill plowing through snow. With a day of intense climbing, plowing through snow was tiring by this point. We could not go straight down the mountain because of the many cliffs on the south face. Finding the road was our only reasonable option for going down. We kept coming upon flat areas with no trees which at first seemed like a road but would suddenly come to an end. Our pace steadily became slower as exhaustion settled in. Sometimes we had to lay down and take a nap just to be able to continue. We would wake up cold and have to hurry on to warm ourselves up. Eventually Michael got tired of plowing through snow on the ridge and finally decided to head down hill. If we hit a road, great! And if not, well there is not a lot we could do. Eventually we came across a old logging road which took us all the way near Wallace Lake. The road split off onto another road that went to Wallace Falls. From here it was a 2.5 mile walk to the trailhead. We biked the rest of the way to Gold Bar, arriving at 6 a.m. where we waited for the next bus back home. I am happy to be home typing this and hope never to get into this kind of situation again. Although I certainly don't recommend experiencing anything like this, it certainly makes one appreciate being safe at home and many other things that we all take for granted.

It sounds like it was a real hair-raising adventure. On the other hand, it seems like it wasn't really worth the risks that you two took. Many climbers would have turned around when they realized that they forgot their ice axe. I have had to turn around before for that reason myself. Smart climbers will learn from a situation like this and never take such risks again. But some climbers will never learn from their mistakes, and sadly, those are the ones who will eventually get themselves killed. I think it's totally natural for a developing climber to find himself in a bit of trouble like this. It's certainly happened to me over the years. But the important question is how will this affect your decisions in the future? Redwic - Dec 25, 2011 10:18 pm - Voted 10/10 Re: A Mixed Reaction Technically speaking, was the ""new route"" actually completed? It sounds like they reached a ridgetop (knowing that area a little bit, I think I can guess which one), but there was not any mention of reaching the summit. And judging by their descriptions, time, conditions, etc. I have doubts the summit was reached. This is perhaps a ""new route"" for reaching a particular ridgetop, but whether or not this is a feasible new route for the summit remains to be seen. But that is not to downgrade their experience or the difficulties within. But perhaps this type of experience is why most people approach this peak from totally different directions than this, and definitely with different conditions. I am glad they both got back safe and I really hope they both learn from this experience. I am also glad that they have enough humility and openness to share this experience with others. Please don't use this experience as a motivator to push to harder goals, Josh and Michael. You can only tempt fate for so long, and mountaineering already has enough risks with good conditions.

For example lets just say the Gib Ledges had never been attempted and Ingraham Direct was. You make it up the Gib Ledges and onto the Ingraham. You don't make it to the summit but I would say yes to the new route and no to summitting. However these technical aspects of climbing take away the pure joy of just getting out and being on the mountain. blakemj33 - Dec 28, 2011 2:47 pm - Hasn't voted Re: A Mixed Reaction Well said!!!!

multi-day,Rainier -- Remove the asterisk! (DC),"BackgroundI met Ian through our common interest in bootfitting via participation in an online backpacking discussion forum. We had a few differences of opinion, but I knew immediately that Ian was an individual worthy of respect. After exchanging several ideas electronically, Ian and I had an opportunity to meet face-to-face when my wife Laura and I visited my brother in Ian’s home territory of Virginia. We met for a day of top-roping at a local D.C. area crag. Since it was one of my first outdoor rock climbing experiences, I paid close attention to how Ian set anchors and was impressed by his rope handling skills. I felt comfortable with Ian. I trusted his experience and his judgment. And from that day forward he became a sort of virtual mentor in my pursuit of climbing experience. After a few years of exchanging emails and phone calls (always with the idea in the back of my mind of climbing with Ian someday), I proposed a trip to climb Mount Rainier. I knew that Ian had attempted the mountain twice previously and had been forced to turn back both times before reaching the summit due to poor weather conditions among other factors. My own successful summit bid a year earlier had an asterisk associated with it, as we opted to turn back after reaching the crater rim but before reaching the highest point on the mountain due to poor visibility, 75+ mph winds, and an exhausted teammate. It appeared that our initial plans to climb Rainier together were falling through. But then I received an email from Ian saying that he and one of his climbing buddies (James) had tickets booked to Seattle and needed a third partner for the rope team. Coincidentally, I was already looking for something to climb that weekend, as Laura would be traveling out of town. I joined the team with excitement – both at the prospect of finally climbing with Ian and the opportunity to visit the majestic mountain yet again. The TripWednesday – Arrival and Departure We exchanged several emails in the planning stages of the trip (including several references to cheesy mountaineering movies that prompted me to rent a VHS player just so I could watch “K2”). The anticipation for me was realized when I picked up Ian and James Wednesday afternoon from the Seattle airport and we drove to Paradise, which looked like anything but paradise on this particular day. The spitting rain and cold wind served as a reminder of what the forecast predicted, but there was anticipated to be a break in the weather Thursday night and Friday as a ridge of high pressure moved in. We packed up and started hiking up into the uninviting, white atmosphere. Having been extremely busy at work over the past several days/weeks/months, I was concerned that my fitness level would not be sufficient to keep up with my fit marathon-ready partners. But I had the advantage of having hiked some vertical terrain in preparation for the climb. On the inclines that Ian and James complained of “feeling the burn,” I was wondering when the climbing was going to start. In hindsight, I could have prevented two swift kicks in the butt had I not verbalized this sentiment to my partners. We hiked up through the whiteness until it was obvious the sunlight was diminishing before we stopped to find a place suitable to make camp. We pitched the tent just above Pebble Creek, feeling healthy but tired. Except for James. He had been working long hours too, but with the early morning flight and the three-hour time change, he had been active for nearly twenty-four hours with only a couple hours of sleep the night before. He vomited after we reached camp and complained of a headache. Acute Mountain Sickness may show up as low as 5,000 feet in some people, but this was the lowest I’d seen anybody experience it. Unfortunately, there is no way to predict the who, when or where of altitude sickness. James had been higher several times previously without similar symptoms. Anticipating that James would feel better after some rest at the current elevation, we ate, drank, and climbed into the tent under a starless canopy of clouds. After several hours of warm, peaceful sleep – broken only by occasional sleet pelting the tent – I awoke to the sun trying to burn off the thick layer of clouds. I peeked out of the tent and saw that the sun was doing a pretty good job of it. Unfortunately, James was not able to get the rest he needed as he spent a near sleepless night struggling with his discomfort. Thursday – Splitting up We slept in late on Thursday morning, allowing James to rest and recuperate. He felt physically better late in the morning, but still was not 100% and felt a bit anxious about the climb. He agreed to attempt the rest of the hike to Muir, but was pretty certain he would not be joining us on our summit attempt. After some hot soup for breakfast, we broke camp and started hiking up. It soon became apparent that James needed to go back down. Ian and I were ready to stash our packs and hike back down with him to safety before returning to pick up our packs and finish the hike to Camp Muir. Fortunately, a descending hiker agreed to walk back down with James. (This hiker turned out to be Todd Burleson – an accomplished mountaineer with several successful Everest summits who happened to be on his way to catch a flight to lead a Denali expedition.) Ian and I divided the remaining food and group gear that we’d need and sent James down with as much as we felt he could safely handle. The drawback here is that we packed food for up to four days for three people; we had a three-person tent, a three-person cookset, and fuel for three people. Among three people, the weight isn’t bad, but split amongst the two of us, my pack felt burdensome. It was easily the heaviest load I had ever carried up a hill. We arrived at the 10,080 ft Camp Muir around 5:00 PM – later than we would have liked, but still early enough to allow us some rest before a summit attempt early the next morning. After hiking up through clouds, the skies finally opened to reveal sun and bright blue hues. It appeared as though the extended forecast was accurate, and our window of clear weather was arriving right on target. We cooked dinner, melted water, and prepared our gear for an early morning alpine start. We opted to stay in the public shelter to maximize our available time. We were in bed shortly after 9:00 PM. Friday – The Ascent We awoke just before 2:00 AM to groaning, clanking and hissing as other climbers woke up, prepared their gear and cooked their breakfast before starting the summit bid. After the initial activity, Ian and I rolled out of our bags, made some hot soup and packed up. The night sky above was crystal clear as the snow crunched beneath our feet. The stars were spectacular as we watched the line of white headlamps slowly ascend the Cowlitz Glacier on the route out of Muir. We commenced our journey to the upper mountain shortly after 3:30 AM. We crossed the unbroken Cowlitz and picked our way up the Cathedral Rocks, reaching the area of Ingraham Flats just as the sun was beginning to tease the horizon. We were treated to a spectacular sunrise over Little Tahoma, with a sea of clouds far below us. That is one of those views that you can’t easily experience anywhere except on the side of a mountain after an alpine start! Like the feeling of a perfect swing in golf, it’s one of the things that keeps me coming back for more! We saw some climbers ascending the Ingraham Direct route, but having heard that crevasses on that route were opening up and with a freshly made boot trail on the Disappointment Cleaver route, we opted for the Cleaver. We crossed the Ingraham Glacier and clipped into the recently placed fixed lines to gain the Cleaver. Rockfall is a potential hazard during this part of the climb, but the rocks were content to lie still that morning. Looking at the steep cliffs just a bit farther down the slope, I was thankful for the security offered by the fixed lines that helped to prevent a minor misstep from turning into a major catastrophe on this exposed section of the route. Once we had gained the cleaver, we ascended a steep snow slope protected by a few running belays left by other teams on the mountain. We scrambled up a couple steep rocky sections before hitting the snow field on the Cleaver. We ascended this to 12,400 feet, where we encountered our first crevasse crossing as the route left the Cleaver and joined the big Emmons Glacier. The snow bridge was protected by pickets. It was a little intimidating staring down into the gaping crevasse, but we crossed without issue. We followed the boot path as it traversed farther to climber’s right on the Emmon’s Glacier before we started climbing again. This traverse avoids the large crevasses above the Cleaver. Around 13,000 feet, I noticed that Ian was slowing down. I asked if he was feeling okay, and he said that he had a bit of a headache, but nothing out of the ordinary. He said he would be fine. I was a bit concerned, but Ian was an experienced mountaineer and was completely lucid. It was obvious that he was working harder than he had been lower on the mountain, but so was I. That is a common experience at higher elevations. I trusted his judgment that he’d be okay, but I kept a close eye on him to watch for any further symptoms. A bit higher, I noticed that Ian was struggling a bit to keep going. I asked him again how he was feeling. He responded that he would be fine. He seemed a bit agitated… not so much at me, but rather at his body’s unwillingness to cooperate with his intentions. He caught a bit of the flu from his young son before leaving for the trip, and that certainly wasn’t helping him high on the mountain. After seeing Ian continue to fight against his body, I asked him again how he was feeling. When he assured me for the third time that he would be fine and would be able to make it up, I reminded him to keep some reserves for the descent, too. I expressed my concern at his condition, and I considered suggesting that we turn back to play it safe. Though I wanted to reach the summit, I was concerned about our ability to return safely to Muir. The sun was getting warm and the few snow bridges we crossed were only going to get weaker. I wondered what some of the steep sections would look like descending the Cleaver. I believe I would have turned back were it not for my respected partner’s resolve to continue pushing higher. Knowing that Ian prefers to climb conservatively and is not prone to summit fever, I once again trusted his judgment. We continued to climb and passed a few cheerful descending parties who encouraged us, telling us that the summit was just around the corner. We wished them a safe descent. I scoffed a bit when they said the crater was just a few minutes away. I had been checking my altimeter on the way up, and it was now showing 13,500 feet – still nearly 1,000 vertical feet from the top. Only when we were looking down into the crater about ten minutes later did I realize that my altimeter was on ‘hold’ at 13,500. I reset it and saw it jump to over 14,000! The crater was inviting and warm, with bright blue windless skies above. A few other parties were basking in the warm sun as they rested before their descent. We stopped to rest and chat briefly with a guide before crossing the crater to reach the true summit of Columbia Crest at 14,411 feet. We were moving slowly, and I suggested removing our packs and unclipping from the rope in order to move more freely. Ian didn’t like that suggestion because the way he had the excess rope coiled and his prussiks attached made it difficult to unclip. Being tired myself and wanting to feel refreshed, I convinced him to do it anyway. Only afterward did I realize that it may have been easier for him to stay clipped in. We clambered up the remaining five minutes to Columbia Crest and briefly enjoyed the 360 degree views. We could see peaks well into Oregon and beyond Mount Baker to the north – possibly as far north as Canada. The summit photos attest to how exhausted Ian was by this point, so we kept our visit at the top short. We exchanged a high-five and snapped a few shots. Then I silently thanked Rainier for allowing us to safely reach her summit (removing my asterisk) and we began our arduous descent. Friday – The Descent As we were leaving the crater, we chatted briefly with another party who had ascended the Ingraham Direct route. They were considering descending the Disappointment Cleaver route to avoid some of the sketchy snow bridges on the ID. Hearing this, I quietly asked them to keep an eye out for us on the descent, indicating that Ian wasn’t feeling 100%. They nodded their agreement. It was already 11:00 AM by the time we left the crater. Ian mentioned that he was ready for a speedy descent, and I agreed, but indicated that I would prefer a safe descent over a speedy one. If we could have both – then great! As it turned out, we were moving quite slowly. I asked Ian to lead on the descent so that I could keep a watchful eye out and arrest any slips or falls. I still felt physically strong, but knew my muscles were getting tired. The anxiety I felt descending with only one partner – who was feeling less than ideal – didn’t allow me to relax. I was slightly distracted as my mind played out several “what if” scenarios. Since I was momentarily not paying attention and moving faster than Ian, the rope became slack and interfered with Ian’s footwork. A couple stern reminders from Ian to watch the rope were all I needed to return my focus to the present and keep my eye on him and the rope. I saw the party behind us descending. They were still far back, but I anticipated that they would quickly pass us at the rate we were moving. After an hour passed and they hadn’t gained much ground, I suspected they were holding back a bit in order to keep an eye on us from above. When they finally caught up at the snow bridge to the top of the Cleaver, it became apparent that the three of them were exhausted and in need of some rest. Because they were not familiar with the descent of the Cleaver, they asked if they could descend with us. Though we wanted to keep moving to get Ian to safety as quickly as possible, we agreed to hold up for a few minutes while they rested. So, here we were… five of us… late on a hot afternoon, descending the Disappointment Cleaver. Ian was severely dehydrated and we were nearly out of water. He had a splitting headache and did not have much left in reserves. The other team was unsure of the route, dehydrated and entirely exhausted. At this point, I was the only one feeling strong physically and my reserves were beginning to be tapped, too. I felt confident that we would make it down safely at this point, but I still couldn’t help feeling some anxiety at the situation. I wondered why I ever enjoyed climbing in the first place. At that moment, it wasn’t much fun. We set out a minute or two ahead of the other team to minimize risk of falling rocks or other objects from above. The descent of the snow field to the right of the rocky spine we had climbed proved to be the most physically demanding section of the entire climb. With both of us tired already, we plunged through soft, mashed potato snow up to our knees (and sometimes our waist) for about 1,000 vertical feet. Every single step required strained mental concentration and physical effort. It was a huge relief to finally reach the fixed ropes that led us off the Cleaver and onto the Ingraham Glacier. Knowing that the rest of the route posed minimal hazard, I finally was able to relax. I confirmed that the party above us was still doing okay, and we kept on pushing. Near Ingraham Flats, I took one final drink of water and gave the rest to Ian, who obviously needed it more than I did. When passing the climbers camped there, I suggested to Ian that we ask for a cup or two of water for him, but he grunted a negative response and kept pushing. By the time we reached Cathedral Gap, Ian was moving even more slowly. We removed our crampons and I stuffed his daypack and gear inside my pack to minimize his burden. We continued the last part of the descent to Camp Muir at a snail’s pace. Finally, after seven hours of climbing and nearly six hours descending, we arrived at Muir. Ian immediately crashed on the wooden floor of the public shelter. I set out to find someone willing to share a liter of water for Ian right away to tide him over until I was able to melt some snow. The rangers proved to be extremely friendly and helpful in our hour of need. After rehydrating some, but not able to keep down any food, Ian curled up in his sleeping bag. He drifted in and out of sleep/consciousness, groaning and snoring for the next several hours. Whenever he was awake, I reminded him to keep drinking, but could not get him to eat anything. I stored up enough water for both of us, cooked myself some dinner, then we both got some much needed rest for the night. Saturday – Return to Paradise We awoke on Saturday morning to howling 40+ mph winds and blowing snow. The expected front had moved in more quickly than anticipated. Ian still was not feeling well, and we knew we had to find a way to get him down soon. I kept in touch with the rangers at Camp Muir, relaying Ian’s condition. Once again they were extremely helpful with information and offers of assistance. I learned from the rangers that the weather was only expected to worsen over the course of the next two or three days, but that currently the winds and snow would likely diminish just a thousand feet lower on the mountain. This was evidenced by the fact that we could actually see Paradise from above. There was a large group of novice climbers in the public shelter that was debating whether to descend or wait out the weather. After I relayed what I had learned from the rangers, we all agreed to descend through the white-out to Paradise. We certainly had no desire to stay on the mountain any longer. Ian and I had stuffed all of our gear into our packs. Ian was obviously in pain, but had a steely resolve about him. He had taken some codeine to take the edge off. We discussed crafting a sled from a sleeping pad in order to haul his pack, but he was determined to carry it himself. We were the first party to leave the shelter, and the others followed shortly after. The wind-driven snow/sleet pelted us. The gusts were schoolyard bullies, constantly shoving us and knocking us around. But as the rangers had anticipated, the wind and snow lessened as we descended. Whether from the codeine or from the lower elevations, Ian began to regain some strength. In fact, there were sections that I started to fall behind his increasing pace. We were able to enjoy a few short glissades on the way down, which saved some energy and provided some much needed fun! Though the weather was only marginally better than when we first arrived at the mountain a few days before, Paradise was much more inviting on the descent! By 10:00 Saturday morning, we had returned. We removed our packs and breathed a great sigh of relief. Then we began the adventure of locating James, who had our vehicle and was presumably somewhere in the state of Washington. Negotiating weak cell signals, broken payphones, a collect call to a sister-in-law with a request to call James for us, and unanswered text messages, we could do nothing else but wait. When James walked through the door, I never thought I’d be so happy to see someone I’d only known for three days! As we were driving down the road from Paradise, I looked back toward the mountain… obscured by clouds. I was already forgetting the suffering of the past few days and was wondering when I would return to this majestic place to climb again. Images View Rainier -- Remove the asterisk!

multi-day,Booyah! Having a Ball on the Ptarmigan Traverse,"Introduction ""You can take the man out of the woods, but you can't take the woods out of the man"" -Gary Paulsen This was the most exciting adventure of the year. I had been wanting to do the Ptarmigan Traverse for a very long time. From having an attempt on this route and climbing Dome Peak the previous year I knew both ends of the traverse quite well. But hidden within a fortress of mountains lied a handful of surprises. The traverse included miles of glacier travel, white out conditions, steep snow climbing, rappelling off a cornice, navigation, and one of the worst bush whacks I have ever done. By the end of the adventure my feet were the most shredded they ever have been in my entire life! I'm still taking antibiotics and taking it easy. The trip began when Eric Darsow emailed me while I was on a Beartooth Range adventure. I immediately agreed knowing that any opportunity at this would be too great to pass up. The weather forecast was calling for perfect weather which I was shocked. For many years it's been terrible weather during early July. But as fate goes, somethings are too good to be true. Fortunately the adventure went well beyond my expectations and took me into one of the most remote places in Washington. This was well worth the years of waiting. Day 1: The Journey BeginsAfter staying up until 4 a.m. packing and researching I get some well deserved rest. In the morning I head on to my math class and head back home shortly before Eric Darsow arrives. Considering that we didn't have a bike rack we placed both bikes on top of the car with a blanket and bungie cables. After a few hours of driving and chatting we were at the Suiattle trailhead. On the way we ditched our packs to save effort while biking down the 12 mile road. After having a few more mini donuts and some final packing we set off for the Ptarmigan Traverse. The 12 miles was mostly moderate with many down hills. As I picked up speed I couldn't help but smile as the wind rushed on me. Excitement was now roaring, I knew this was going to be an amazing experience. As we biked along I saw one of the strangest things I've ever seen. A fern plant appeared to be dancing back and forth in a wild like motion. I waited to see if an animal had bumped it, but I saw none. I guess one can see new things each time they enter the forest, even after years of seeing what they believe to be everything. Near the end of the road we picked up our packs from a huge ditch area and biked the rest with our heavy packs on. At the end of the road we ditched our bikes in the bushes. Getting on the other side of the road we pulled out our thumbs for the hitch hike section of the trip. ""An escalate will never pick us up"" Eric said. ""I know, but it's always worth a shot"" I laugh as I put down my thumb. After about an hour or so we were given a ride to Rockport. From Rockport we stayed for a while in attempts to get another ride. While we were waiting my buddy Gimpilator came by and had a quick chat with him. He would have helped us out, but not only was he going a different direction, but it wasn't even his car. Hitch Hiking to Marblemount After waiting another hour or so a truck driver gave us a ride to Marblemount right next to the Cascade River campground. We attempted to hitch hike up the Cascade Valley that evening. Even though it was a week day quite a few cars came by late in the day. Once it was sunset we finally gave up and Eric paid the man $10 to stay at the campground. I guess it pays off to bring money even on an adventure. Day 2: Approaching the MountainsWe started our hitch hiking attempts at 7 a.m. A little after two hours a nice woman gives us a ride 4 miles up the road. Every little bit counts. With as many vehicles that went by I figured we would have gotten a hitch. Eventually we realized no one was going to help us. Didn't matter if the truck beds were entirely open and it had little to do with how much space there was in the cars. We saw just about every combination of car setup. We even saw two seater cars that looked like they were from the 1930's. ""Well, looks like we gotta hike it"" I sighed. It got pretty warm walking along the road with the valley catching the humidity. The forecast said something like 97 degrees for Marblemount. A ways into our walk I noticed my feet already hurting. ""This can't be good"" I thought to myself. Eric had the same issue. A row of cars come by, surely one of them would give us a ride - right? Nope. One of the drivers looked just like Gimpilator. Imagine seeing someone who looked just like one of your best friends driving by. Giving you a death stare and then ignoring you. It was as if it was in slow motion, like a movie. ""You've got to be kidding me!"" Eric would say in anger. I couldn't blame him one bit. Before starting up I saw that my chocolate donuts were melted. At least they are still tasty as ever. Walking up the Cascade Valley Eric with Dorado Needle Flowers along the Way Contrasting Moss on the Side of the Road After hiking for about 10 miles we see a car coming. We had long since believed we would have to walk the full 19 miles of the road, but a shred of hope still remained. This time we were in luck. Both of us were ecstatic! I've seen time and time again the people you wouldn't think who would give you a ride do. Old married folks, a mom with her kids with a almost full car, and solo people. In society we often hear little phrases like ""things will just work out"" or there is always someone to help"". That's not always true. There are those who ""slip between the cracks"". It happens all the time, but few seems to care. Fortunately I was lucky in this case. Arriving at the trailhead we thank Don and his wife for the ride. It was now possible to make it on schedule to get back by Sunday. But even with the lift it wasn't going to be easy. The trail up to Cascade Pass was in great condition and was mostly snow free. Near the end I had to be careful considering that I was in tennis shoes. Hiking up to Cascade Pass (Taken by Eric) The Triad At the pass we took a long break enjoying the views around us. It was time to put on the plastic boots for almost the rest of the trip (well except for when I'm in camp). Considering that I knew the way I led the way around the edge of Mixup Peak. You could see the trail every now and then, but it was mostly snow covered. Near the Cache glacier was a perfect camping spot on a snow field. Eric and I dug out a platform and set up the tent. During sunset I went to a near by waterfall to fetch water for cooking and drinking. It felt good to be in my favorite region of the world. Brooker Mountain Heading up the Slope Mount Torment and Forbidden Snow Slope to Camp Eric Traversing the Slope with Eldorado Peak Our Camp with Magic Mountain Mount Buckner's South Face Sahale Mountain with Green Colors Alpenglow on Magic Mountain (Eric) Filling up Water on Mixup Peak (Eric) Eldorado Peak during Sunset Evening from Camp Day 3: Beginning the TraverseThe next morning after putting away the tent we walked down to the Cache Glacier. We roped up and set up butterfly knots to create rope drag in case anything happened. After crossing the Cache Glacier we had a small scramble section before arriving at the Cache Col. From there we descended down to Kool Aid Lake. Heading up the Cache Col Mount Formidable and Spider Mountain At the lake we took in the views, pulled out my Kool Aid, took some photos, and started back up again. Eric noticed clouds coming in. At first I didn't think much of them, figured they were just passing clouds. I wasn't 100% sure where the red ledge was, but figured the ledge that had a red color had to be the one. Mount Formidable Reflection from Kool Aid Lake Photographing Mount Formidable (Eric) The Red Ledge Oh Yeah! Kool Aid Lake with Kool Aid Where We Came From (Eric) Johannesburg with Kool Aid Lake Thumbs Up (Eric) As we came closer I saw what appeared to be ski tracks. Always a lovely sight. As we get near the red ledge, the slope steepens and our pace slows down. I start making bucket steps for both Eric and for my own comfort. Had I not had plastic boots it would have been very difficult to make the steps. About 20 feet before getting on the ledges was the hardest part. With a small amount of being nervous I make every step solid and with each ice axe plunge. Below was a cliff. In normal conditions one could simply walk right onto the ledge, but the icy snow made it a bit more tedious. Once we arrived on solid ground the ledge crossing was a lot friendlier. At the second snowfield the exposure was greater, but was a lot easier to work the steps. Eric on the Red Ledge Crossing the Second Snowfield Myself Heading for the Moat (Eric) Descending Down to Middle Cascade Glacier (Eric) Eric didn't like the look of the ending snowfield. So I decided to climb it, see what was ahead, and then down climb a moat. I dropped off my pack so that I could port both of our packs up though the moat (there was a rock step). With a little careful scrambling Eric was at the top of the moat. I was pleased that getting to the Middle Cascade Glacier would not be difficult nor dangerous. After having a lunch break we made our way down and around a cliff edge. With a bit more snow travel we arrive at the Middle Cascade Glacier. Clouds were now hitting Mount Formidable and weather was becoming a concern. Mount Formidable from the North Sahale and Boston Peak Johannesburg with Eldorado Peak Excited to be Here (Eric) Eric with the Middle Cascade Valley In a little over an hour we crossed the glacier and arrive at the Formidable Spider Col. I was in awe as we walked towards the edge. It was like a fortress of mountains covered in glaciers. What a joy it was to see this. Looking down below my smile quickly faded. We were surrounded by sketchy terrain. From cliffs to sketchy slopes the route down looked questionable at best. ""Maybe we arrived at the wrong col"" I announce to Eric. After looking at the map, we were indeed at the right col. A few moments earlier we passed a small col that appeared to drop off the earth. The Rest of the Ptarmigan Traverse Need I Say More? Looking into Wonderland The Gloomy Castle of Spire Point The Fortress Wall of Mountains ""Let's at least give it a look"" I yell back in hopes that it goes. ""I don't like the look of it"" Eric replies. In mountaineering when your out of options you have to try out the ones you don't think are going to fly. It wasn't that I was taking a blind leap into the unknown, but putting out a leap of faith into what may be the only way. I finally got Eric to agree to allow me to explore it so long as we placed in snow pickets. The snow took us down further. Eric was still not convinced that it went. ""Let me check just a little further"" I said with a smile. After heading down a hundred or so feet I could slowly see the route would indeed go. I was so pleased to see this. Heading down the Formidable Col Old Guard and Sentinel Peak As we head down the snow, the clouds drift over the mountains making a white out a serious possibility. Each step became painful as the padding of my boots pressed against my blistered skin. Making it to Yang Yang lakes that night was cast out of the possibilities. We were tired and the weather was not going to hold for long. We found a nice flat spot on the snowfield near some large boulders. At camp we had dinner, Eric helped pad my blisters, and watched the sky go away. Eric sat out on the rocks reading one of his two books. As it got dark the clouds followed and all that was left was a misty view. As the Clouds Drop Excited Eric Cloudy Peak in the Distance Mountains Clouding Over Agnes Mountain North Face Storm over Le Conte Le Conte Glacier Pathway Bad Weather Arrives (Eric) The Route to Yang Yang Lakes Our Camp on Mount Formidable Day 4: Miles of Fog and GlaciersConsidering the nasty weather outside we slept in. ""What do you want to do Josh"" Eric announced. ""Proceed"" I replied"". ""But there is almost no visibility"" he said. ""I have pictures from the previous day showing the way"" I reply. With some observations Eric decides to give it a try. Mount Formidable Clearing Standing at the Edge of Cloudiness Considering the steep snow slopes to get to Yang Yang lakes, we decided to take the lower route. This is where my years of navigation though storms paid off quite well. We did a combination of descending and ascending through snow slopes and shrubby areas. At one point I wasn't quite sure which way was the right path. Pulling out the camera I see a ""C"" shaped snowfield right near by me. Using photographs and piecing together the evidence I figured out exactly where we were. With a bit of descending we arrived at Yang Yang lakes. We were both pretty pleased. For what ever reason the weather at the lakes was a bit better and allowed for minor openings in the clouds. But not enough to get much information on how exactly to go about our route. Pointing Out the Way (Eric) Yang Yang Lakes View After having lunch at the lake I decided that following the trail was the best option. I'm not always into conformity but in this case it looked as if any other options could lead us onto places that are less than ideal. The trail faded off into a snowfield leading us up to the proper gully. As we enter the gully Eric announces that he does not feel comfortable with the idea of heading up into bad weather when neither of us know exactly where the route goes. ""No worries Eric, I'm glad that you were willing to give it a try"" I reply with a smile. For myself, the attempt was not in vain. We went back to south Yang Yang lake. ""Our level of risk taking is quite different"" Eric said. ""I know"". ""So your okay with going into a white out with howling winds, possibly stormy weather, and not exactly sure where you are going"" Eric replied. ""Yeah"" I whisper back. While bad weather was a possibility, it was not a certainty. Bailing on the Ptarmigan Traverse isn't such an easy task. It's a committing route. Eric and I were very aware of this fact. I told Eric that I was more than willing to bail, but that I believed that we could proceed safely. Eric examined his map figuring out our escape options and how far we still had to go. There was only one reasonable escape option which involved hiking down a potentially very bad bushwhack valley (Flat Creek) and then hiking up the Stehekin river all the way up to Cascade Pass. Then it would involve another round of possible hitch hike difficulties plus a 12 mile bike ride. View from South Yang Yang Lake We had much debating of our options and thought it over for a long time. Eric finally came to a conclusion. ""I don't think this is a good idea, but I'll go for it"" Eric announces. With quick time we hike back over from the lake to the bottom of the gully. The rest of the gully was not as bad as it looked. At the top of the gully we started descending the nearly flat ridge toward Le Conte Mountain. Eventually I found the trail! We were both ecstatic. After a while the trail faded into snow. Seeing a cornice near by was a good sign of us being on route. Making the Best of It As I traveled along the snowfield it appeared to steepen with cliffs below. ""I'm not liking the looks of this"" Eric said. He suggested the snowfield that was above. I didn't like the idea at first considering that it conflicted with evidence that I had, but I undermined the distance of a photograph. Nearing the top I take a look at my photos again and was pleased to announce that we were on route. From here the snow gently traversed along the edge of Le Conte Mountain. As I traversed the snow, I found the ski tracks again. ""Well I'll be darned"" Eric said with excitement. It was a neat time frame to see the Le Conte Glacier hanging over cliffs with a beautiful blue lake below and to be heading into a white out. Using Pictures to Figure Out the Way (Eric) Myself with Le Conte Lake (Eric) Le Conte Glacier though the Clouds Following the Ski Tracks Looking down on Le Conte Lake Flat Creek Valley Near the edge of the glacier we found a rock spot to rope up. There was just enough room for the two of us to carefully get our gear together. It was a little bit tedious. Any wrong move and it could sent my backpack, ice axe, or other equipment flying down the cliffs below that go into a glacier. When we were all set I decided it was best to have my camera away. Eric fortunately took a few picture on the next part of the trip. As we walk onto the glacier, the views disappear and we are back into a whiteout. The Cliffs Above Crevasses on the Le Conte Glacier The glacier was in mostly good shape with a few crevasses to walk around. ""Eric look, a arch shaped crevasse!"" I yell. ""I don't even want to look"" Eric replies as he watches each step carefully. It had multiple layers to it. It almost had the appearance of an arch from arches national park. As the slope flattens out I start heading to the glaciers edge in hopes for it being our exit. As I look above I see nothing but dark gloomy cliffs. The place was anything but inviting. I decided that if this wasn't the way, either I passed it or had to try going higher. I decided it was best to try up before going back. Fortunately going up was the right call. As we arrive at the second flat section I head back to the glaciers edge. ""This is the gap"" I yell in excitement"". I show Eric the man made rock camp site. Eric was thrilled about this. At the very least we had a bail spot. But to maximize our time we decided to keep going. While traversing the edge of Sentinel Peak I had no more photographs to help give any evidence of where we were going. Fortunately I found the ski tracks which we followed for as long as possible. Eventually they led us to a series of cliffs. Through the fog we could see the glacier down below, it looked so massive. Perhaps one of the biggest in the state. With a little bit of looking around I found a ramp down onto the glacier. South Cascade Glacier Below (Eric) Is this Going to Go? Exploring the Cliff Edge (Eric) Taking the Ramp onto the Glacier (Eric) We passed by a man made over sight. To my surprise the glacier did not have many crevasses. Yeah, there would be a baby one here and there, but no big deal. As time goes by I'm in a constant slog walk going up. Not entirely sure where to exit. We were lucky to have had a break in the clouds to see our exit. But the way it happened made it still some what of a mystery. ""Josh, you need to head right"" Eric would yell. I'd walk a bit right, but then eventually go back in the habit of following the curved glacier streaks. Perhaps it was because I was so tired. Eric told me again later, so I had us go diagonal to what we had been going. The slope steeped and eventually required a traverse. After crossing the snow we arrived on rock. After doing a bit more exploring I saw what appeared to be a saddle. Excitement roars as I tell Eric ""I think this is it!"". Heading down onto it I quickly discover that it was a cornice. The sky was getting dark rapidly. I could see white rock lakes down below. I explained the situation to Eric. He was not pleased. Not only would we have to belay each other off the cornice but we were not even sure if the slope safely went. ""Josh, we don't know if this goes"" Eric yelled. ""We are running out of time and we don't have a lot of options"" I yelled back to Eric. There were only two passes that we saw. One was a high pass and the other was a low one. We were on the low one. Logically this made sense for this one to be the one, especially with what I remembered from looking at maps. But I could not confirm it. Eric seemed quite worried about this. I was a little bit as well. ""We have to at least give it a try, waiting here won't solve anything"" I said. Eric agreed. I set up the anchor while Eric took care of the rope. Eric decided to go first, I got the belay ready, and he was on. As I was belaying Eric off the cornice I saw one of the coolest things I've ever seen. Glacier Peak popped out of the clouds with full on alpenglow color. It dwarfed Dome Peak which looked huge in itself. Seeing it all in one setting was beyond words. It was for my eyes only. I couldn't take a picture because I was kinda sorta belaying my partner off a cornice. And it's kinda a big deal for me to make sure that goes well. By the time he was down the colors were gone. It was time for me to head down. Face in the slope, place axe in well, and kick in the snow. At the bottom we followed the bottom of the cornice to the other side where it seemed safer. Still racing the clock I quickly plunge step down the snowfield to make sure it goes. Once Eric arrived I did the final traverse and could happily announce ""it goes"". The rest of the way down was a snow walk to the lake. After looking around for a little bit we found a flat spot a set up camp. ""That was the most absurd day of my life"" Eric exclaimed. Heading Down to White Rock Lakes (Eric) So Excited for Dinner (Eric) I walked down to West Agnes creek to fill up water for cooking and drinking. The view was so beautiful I decided to return for a night shot. After some tasty cheese pasta and good food I slept great that night. Dome, Sinister, and Gunsight during Evening Dome Peak during Evening Day 5: Bushwhack CityOnce again we slept in a bit due to how tiring the previous day was. Eric helped bandage me up due to my blisters being even worse. ""Josh, I know how you like your adventure. So how would you like to solo the rest of the way and I'll head down the Downey drainage?"". It was indeed a tempting offer. I could avoid serious buchwhacking if I did this route. However there were some serious red flags that were raised. The gap over Spire Point had a cornice. There were some crevasses over the glacier. The Downey creek drainage had some steep contours. If either of us got injured, it would very very serious. With all these red flags I decided against the idea. ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm going to have to decline"" I said after a while of thinking it over. I've seen a lot of trouble in my time from splitting up. After having a bowl of cereal we packed up camp. Creek View of Dome Peak Spire Point's Northeast Face Looking over the Maps (Eric) Sinister Peak's Northwest Face The Pass we Came From Agnes Mountain's West Face Heading up to the Pass White Rock Lakes View Gunsight Peak Yours Truly with Dome (Eric) Spire on Spire Point Old Guard Peak's Summit Crevasses on the Chickamin We passed by Agnes creek and filled up our water. I was going to miss this place, but at least I plan on being back. We hiked up to a pass above White Rock lakes just north of the German Helmet. We took a break and then proceeded down the last valley. Going down the snow wasn't bad at all. Heading over the Last Pass Mount Buckindy East Face Hoch Joch Spitz South Face Eric with the German Helmet Pond Reflection The German Helmet East Face Eventually we start getting back into the woods. This is where things got interesting again. As we went down the route appeared to drop off a cliff. I decided to traverse slightly upward towards the German Helmet. To my luck I found a 5 slinged rappel station. It looked like the only reasonable way down. The rope would not reach with a traditional rappel. Fortunately Eric knew how to setup a pull cord. After a while of setup Eric carefully rappelled down and so did I. As I went down I made sure there was no tangles on the tree. At the bottom I pulled the rope and it came off cleanly. This was the beginning of what became one of the worst bushwhacks I've ever had. Rappelling Down from the Woods Waterfall Below the German Helmet Finishing up the Rappel (Eric) Near by Waterfall (Eric) The bushwhack started out moderate. The slope was steep enough to knock rocks down and require many veggie belays. As we went down further there were snow patches that went over a small creek. At times you had to hope you wouldn't fall in. Sometimes you did anyways. There were so many bugs in a few spots. At one point I was constantly picking them off of me and holding my breath. It didn't help that it was humid, hot, and I was covered in sweat. For a short period of time we escaped the bushwhack and onto boulders. I could finally take off my plastic boots and gear down to tennis shoes. But before doing that I had to inspect my feet. They felt terrible! The band aids and bandages were old, leaving me no choice but to take them off. It wasn't pleasant. Eric pulled out his first aid kit while I washed my feet off. Eric used a ciringe to pressure wash the wounds on my legs. He took good care of me which was deeply appreciated. After everything was all set we started hiking down the boulders. Every step was painful by this point. Every now and then I would almost sprain my ankle. Eric saw this and was concerned. So was I. Each step had to be made with caution. But due to my fragile state my carefulness wouldn't hold up forever. At one point I lightly rolled my ankle. Fortunately it wasn't bad so I was still able to proceed with a fair pace. Heading Down into the Bushes My Feet Before they Got Worse Veggie Belaying Down (Eric) Happy to have Washed my Feet (Eric) As the slope eases the creek bed nearly ended and the bushes took over. This is when things got ugly fast. Following the creek would never word, so we decided that heading into the woods was the best option. The edges between the woods and the creek were the worst spots making it a annoying zone to cross. The woods at least provided some relief, although they weren't that good either. It slowly got worse and we ended up seeing fields of devils club. Fallen over trees were either our best friend or at other times our enemy. Some trees would ""explode"" as you walked on them, but it is worth the risk considering how much time they saved. There was no where good to camp. In fact there was no where bad to camp, it was all terrible. After hours of bushwhacking we see another major creek drainage. ""I think this is Bachelor creek"" Eric said with a happy tone. ""Sorry to bring the bad news, but this is not Bachelor creek. Above is the Spire Glacier"" I replied. We were both disappointed by this fact. This meant we had hours to go before arriving at camp. Friendlier Bush Whacking Spire Point from the Northwest Messzilla Going from One Tree to Another The forest became more and more epic as we went along. Jump here, climb over that tree, get scrapped up by devils club, cross this creek, head up hill a ways, go back down. Soak soak, my feet just got soaked. I'm sure that will help add to the blister situation. It wasn't like this happened every now and then, it was constant. I was constantly out of breath, constantly sweating down my face, getting new scrapes, hurting my feet, getting more exhausted, running out of time, becoming more fatigued, head ache starting up, jump, jog, walk across the log. Suddenly it collapses and I hit my shin super hard on a hidden log sticking out. ""Awwwwwwww ha ha!"" I yell in pain. Almost like being stabbed, oh wait I kinda was. I saw blood coming out my sock. This was the worst battle scar from the trip. Crossing a Creek Looking above I saw the ridge going down. But it had been going down all along. Or so that's what it looked like. ""When will it end?"" I laughed with hysteria. With each motion, each push, and every breath I knew that if I give in just a little bit I would be forced to sleep out in these terrible woods with no tent and getting bit up all night. After many more hours of bush whacking the woods finally curve, we rise up in elevation, and I knew we were close. The woods were getting dark but we arrived just in time to the Downey creek trail. ""YESSSSSS!"" I exclaim in a joyous moment. We soon arrive to a flat area where camp was set up. I filled up water and sat down. I had spent almost everything I had to come this far. I was so fatigued I couldn't help Eric setup the tent. Well I could have, but by the time I would clip in a item or two he would have done at least 10 times more work than me. I just lied down under all my weakness. After some well deserved food and water we went to sleep. I Don't Feel Like Getting Up (Eric) Are We Done Yet? Day 6: Leaving the MountainsEric bandaged what he could of my feet. ""Those are the worst looking feet I have ever seen"" Eric exclaimed. ""This is the worst my feet have ever felt"" I replied. I wasn't quite sure how well my feet would hold up that day, but I wasn't about to give up now. The start of the trail was decent until we crossed the Downey creek bridge. Back Into the Bushwhack The trail was in terrible shape. ""What is this?!"" I yelled as I saw dozens of fallen over trees and devils club on the trail. There's no easy way out. I smiled knowing that's how it usually goes down. But I didn't come here for easy adventure. The devils club even grew over parts of the bridges which was a huge surprise to me. Last year when I climbed Dome Peak the trail was in great shape. Now it was one of the worst looking trails I've ever seen. After many more miles of bad trailness we arrive at the Suiattle river road. What is This? The rest of the walk home was just enduring miles of road walking while being quite tired. Eric made me remember a poem as we walked which to my surprise I remembered. We had many other fun conversations during this trip. When we arrived near the trailhead I said ""the mind see's what it wants to see"" as I thought I imagined seeing the gate. Sure enough I saw it again. ""I wasn't imagining it"" I yell happily. I instantly bit my tongue. At the car I was so happy to take off my pack, shoes, and socks. Paranoid of Hornets (Eric) Happy to be Back! (Eric) After the trip I went to see a doctor for my feet. They gave me over 10 days of antibiotics to prevent my legs from getting infected. My legs on some days would be so swollen that I would almost skip college, but I knew that would defeat the purpose of rushing on this trip. So I went anyways. It wasn't until 11 days later that I could comfortably run again. This was an experience I will never forget. Images View Booyah!

Josh Lewis - Jul 24, 2013 4:49 am - Hasn't voted Re: interesting trip I wanted to go over the Spire col. But Eric was tired of climbing over mountain passes and wanted to get out of the mountains as soon as possible. I knew that going solo the standard way would be way to hazardous for both of us. Eric wouldn't have had a rope for the rappel, I could have had to travel on glacier unroped and go over a cornice. We could have tried to figure something out or go for the Dana Col but again, he felt that he had enough. I can't say I blame him. The bushwhack down Bachelor was friendly, almost non existent. I wish it was like that going down. But we made the best of it and got a good adventure out of it. awilsondc - Jul 23, 2013 11:15 pm - Voted 10/10 Dang! I've always wanted to do the ptarmigan traverse, but after reading this I'm having second thoughts... sounds like the last couple days were terrible! lol, I'm glad you made it back ok and that your legs and feet weren't worse off then they were!

What ever you do, don't take the upper Downey creek drainage. markhyams - Jul 29, 2013 8:49 am - Hasn't voted Shwack!! Well done on surviving the bushwhack down Downey creek. Bushwhacking in the Cascades is possibly the hardest thing to do in that range (or anywhere). It makes glacier travel seem easy and straighforward! My buddy and I also wanted to bail at White Rock Lakes, and we decided to go down West Agnes Creek and try and hook up with the PCT, which was a terrible idea. We got trapped by raging glacial melt creeks and slide alder and had to be helicoptered out. Dana glacier and Spire col look so steep from White Rock Lakes, especially after being so tired and mentally exhausted. Every time I think about that trip, I think, ""we should've taken a rest day,"" and just gone over the Dana Glacier. Looking back at photos and maps, it's no steeper than the stuff we had already gone over, like that steep descent from Spider-Formidable col and the descent to White Rock Lakes. And even going up LeConte glacier. Anyway, that helicopter ride is the low point of my mountaineering career, but calling for help did seem to be the right decision. The guys who rescued us told us that if we hadn't gotten trapped, it would've taken a week to navigate all the deadfall and brush to get back to the PCT. Apparently the trail shown on the map up West Agnes Creek from the PCT hasn't existed for years. Lesson learned. No bushwhacking in the Cascades, especially going DOWN unknown terrain!

single-day,Climbing Mount Rainier in less than a day... from sea level,"The following trip report is a detailed record of the three years leading up to a climb of Mount Rainier by a couple of old high school buddies from Montana (Matt and Braden). The account of our climb in late July of 2012 doesn't start until about halfway down if you wish to skip ahead. Prologue As best as I can remember, the first discussions of this trip were during a climb up Black Mtn (MT) in 2009. Pictured is Matt climbing the Y couloir. While mountaineering in Montana in the summer of 2009, my friend Matt (elchivoloco) proposed an interesting idea for a trip: What if we climbed Mt Rainier, but instead of starting at a usual trailhead (Paradise, Sunrise, etc.), we started at sea level on the Puget Sound and only used human power to attain the summit. This would involve road biking from sea level, then climbing to the summit for a two part adventure that we would later call Sea 2 Summit (S2S). Matt had previously worked in the Tacoma area and apparently this giant mountain had been inspiring him to push the limits of cycling and climbing. I was skeptical but offered to support him by participating in the climbing portion of the trek. I'd been interested in climbing Rainier for almost a decade, but I was living in Montana and never had an easy opportunity to schedule a climb. Conversely, while I owned a road bike, I'd never taken it on a ride any longer than 15 miles, so the thought of biking 75+ miles from sea level to over a mile up just wasn't that appealing. He seemed to accept that answer at the time as he had local biking friends in the Tacoma area that might be interested in joining just the bike ride portion. Hard training on a bike was new to me - such as this ride on the Going-to-the-Sun Hwy early one spring. But by January 2010 (after a few more climbing and skiing trips with Matt), I was fully engrossed in the idea of completing the entire trek. Matt's original idea was just to complete the S2S bike/climb in one day (24 hours), as that would be a feat in and of itself. After researching the idea myself, I started to wonder just how fast one could travel from the sea to the summit of Mount Rainier, using only human power (this was the only other record I could find in my internet meanderings - but this trip has been brought to my attention since posting this trip report). So I offered a counter-proposal: I'd join in for the whole S2S trek, but with the goal of pushing ourselves to complete the journey in the fastest time we could muster. This seemed to be in the neighborhood of 12-14 hours, based on some rough calculations. The idea of competing against the clock was not foreign, as we'd both ran cross country and track in high school and participated in numerous other timed events. That history may have made the idea all the more appealing. Unfortunately, an attempt of the S2S in 2010 wasn't possible as I was working on data collection and analysis for my Master's thesis that summer. Stretching my knee on an easy ski tour at the start of my recovery in the spring of 2011. In the fall of 2010, we started discussing potential trip schedules and training regimens for an attempt of the S2S in June 2011. We decided that the route we would attempt on Rainier would be the straightforward Disappointment Cleaver, with a direct ride from the Puget Sound starting in Steilacoom and ending at Paradise. But before we got very far, I injured my knee on a skiing trip in December 2010. After numerous doctor's visits and physical therapy over many months, I was on the path to recovery by late March 2011. But this did not leave me enough time to adequately train for the strenuous demands of the S2S, even at an easy pace. I had kept Matt in the loop with regards to my injury, but in mid-April we decided to call off the trip for 2011. It was a difficult, but necessary decision. Flash forward to 2012. Matt and I started training in late winter for a 2012 attempt at the S2S, building on a base of backcountry skiing over the winter (Matt had been in Colorado for a few years now and I was still in Montana). We'd actually pushed back our attempt from June 2012 to July in order to complete more training on real roads and mountains (vs. a gym), which ended up being quite fortuitous as the weather in June ended up being miserable and wet on Rainier. [The only downside was that my wife would be 34 weeks pregnant with our first in late July...] Our training consisted of road biking, mountain biking, trail running, and mountaineering. Over the next few months (April-July), we both put in hundreds of hours training and by the middle of July, were both well prepared for the S2S attempt that was only a week away. Our route from sea to summit, looking NW from Rainier to the Puget Sound.    Imagery source: Google Earth Final Prep and Dry Run The Crew: Braden (me), Andy, and Matt, left to right Matt arrived in Montana on July 23. He brought a friend along (Andy) who was going to help us out by joining our dry run climb and shuttling a vehicle/setting up a basecamp at Camp Muir during our S2S attempt. We spent the next day riding a local mountain bike trail, organizing our gear, and reviewing glacier rescue techniques. After paring down our gear to the basic necessities, we crammed our gear into Matt's Impreza. The next day we drove to White Pass in Washington and on the morning of July 26, we were in Paradise. We'd decided long ago that we wanted to complete a dry run of the Disappointment Cleaver route prior to the S2S. There were many advantages to this, including getting first-person beta of the route (which I had never climbed but Matt had), figuring out our climbing pace and clothing systems, and getting some time on the rope together (we didn't have the opportunity to climb together at all during our training in 2012). The primary disadvantage was that it would tire us out, even with a few days rest. So over July 26 and 27, Matt, Andy, and I ascended to Camp Muir, rested for 11 hours, and then completed the climb to the summit of Rainier in the wee hours of the morning. The dry run turned out to be invaluable, as we learned just how difficult it was to pass other rope teams on the DC, especially the larger and generally slower guided groups. We had originally planned to summit around 4-6 am during our S2S attempt, but we realized that there was no way we would be able to maintain a good pace if we kept running into other groups of climbers. Our goal for a summit time would have to be earlier to avoid the crowds, as would our start time at Steilacoom. The original plan was to start the bike at 4 pm, but we decided 2 pm would be more favorable and would hopefully keep us in front of other groups summitting that morning. Shots from our dry run: our first view of Mount Rainier, taking a break just below the Muir snowfield, Andy, Matt and I enjoying the summit, and descending a snowy section of the DC. After finishing the dry run, we scouted the bike route along the Mountain Highway back to the coast. There were two substantial hitches along our intended bike route. One was the closure of a few miles of Hwy 7, which we had known about since June. The detour through Eatonville ended up adding 1.5 miles to our route, as well as additional elevation changes. It seemed there was no option but to take the detour, despite the more narrow and winding roads it followed. The second hitch was that the roads we intended to use south of Tacoma were far too dangerous for cycling, with fast traffic and non-existent shoulders in places. Thankfully, we had a couple of rest days to find a suitable, safe route and were successful in re-routing that part of the bike. Mike and Andy, our support crew, on their way to Camp Muir. While resting between the dry run and S2S, we visited two friends in the Seattle/Tacoma area. Our second host (Mike) decided to join Andy in supporting our S2S adventure at Camp Muir. Both decided they would haul their skis up to Camp Muir and ski down the morning after our climb. Mike's place in Tacoma served as our base of operations and we organized our gear on his front lawn and ran through our crevasse rescue techniques again before heading out for dinner and a beer at a local pub. The Sea 2 Summit Attempt The car packed with a small mountain of gear, ready for our S2S adventure. I woke up the morning of July 29 earlier than I expected at 7:30 am. Matt was awake as well. We'd hoped to sleep in until 10 am or so, as we weren't starting until 2 pm and would be climbing through the night. But both Matt and I were too excited to keep sleeping, so we got up and made a few last minute preparations to our bikes and packs. Something was bothering me, however. I'd had an itch in the back of my throat the previous evening that had gotten worse through the night and now my lymph nodes were swollen. I decided to play it by ear and see how I felt closer to noon, but let Matt know that I wasn't feeling all that great. A little after noon, Matt and I sat down to discuss our options. He wasn't feeling 100% either but wanted to get going rather than wait a few days to see if our health improved. I really wanted to be at 100%, not 90%, as we'd put in so much effort into training for this attempt and I wanted there to be a high chance of success. In the end we decided to go for it, with the explicit understanding that if either of us felt we absolutely needed to stop, the other would comply. Around 1:40pm we arrived at the ferry terminal in Steilacoom, WA. The temperature was around 70°F, the sun was poking between clouds, and you could smell the salt in the air. We did a last minute lube of the bike chains before heading to the water. There's a public boat ramp next to the ferry and we were able to start with our rear wheels touching the water. It was thrilling to get going after years of prep. This was it. At 2 pm on the dot, we set off for Rainier. Mike and Andy took off for the mountain as well to grab their permit to camp at Muir and turn in our climbing permit. Final prep at the Steilacoom Ferry - wheels in the water and off we go! Matt set a quick pace as we snaked through south Tacoma, progressing from Steilacoom to Lake City to Parkland and then Spanaway. The roads we had chosen were fairly wide and only had minimal traffic on a Sunday afternoon. The traffic lights seemed to be turning in our favor and we only put our feet down at a half dozen or so times as we sped through town. Things were looking good, although the pace was a bit quicker than I expected. The scratchiness in my throat appeared to subside in the first few miles of the ride, but that could've just been due to the adrenaline. I meant to take photos during the ride but kept forgetting to get my camera out. By the time we passed the junction to Hwy 507, we were in a nice groove. Matt would pull for a few miles, then I'd take over and lead the next few miles while he drafted. We cycled like that all the way to Eatonville, snacking occasionally and hydrating heavily. It wasn't ridiculously hot, but far from cool. We rolled through Eatonville at 1 hr 48 min into the ride. The uphill south of town on the detour was a little steep, but manageable. A few minutes after cresting the hill we had our only close call with traffic: a truck blew by us with less than a foot to spare and nearly knocked us off the shoulder. Otherwise, the cars passing us were giving us wide berth and even slowing down when traffic was thicker. The detour was certainly the most dangerous section of the ride and I was relieved to be past it and back on Hwy 7 before too long. A quick shot of my watch at the Park entrance. Matt and I passed by the towns of Elbe and Ashford, still rotating the lead (although Matt's pulls were longer), and arrived at the Rainier Park entrance at 5:15 pm. We filled up on water thanks to a ranger who had just come off duty as there weren't any publicly accessible water spigots. Our arrival was a bit earlier than I expected, but we'd kept a fast pace over the first 60 miles. I took a photo of my watch to record the time and we set off a few minutes later after downing a couple of snacks (gels, bars, etc.). Matt took the lead up the road and the grade of the road started to increase. I wasn't able to keep up the pace we'd had before, but Matt seemed fine to stick with me for a slower climb, despite this being his strength. As the road steepened, my calves were straining to even maintain a moderate speed and I slowed further as my legs grew weaker. As we passed Longmire and Cougar Rock, I could feel my legs starting to cramp up and had serious doubts about even making it to Paradise. I started thinking we'd gone way to fast at the beginning of the ride, and that there was no way I was even going to make it to Camp Muir without a serious second wind. Matt kept providing encouragement, but eventually I had to stop. We rested for a good 11 minutes as I tried to find the strength to power on for another 2100 vertical feet to Paradise. I just didn't know if I had it in me. Failure seemed imminent and I had basically lost all mental focus. I don't remember how, but a few words from Matt brought me back just far enough to keep going, away from that dark pool of self-doubt, anger, and disappointment. I was f%#&ing frustrated, but got back on the saddle and kept pushing, one pedal stroke after another, plodding up the hill at what seemed to be a snail's pace. Thankfully, the uphill traffic was basically non-existent in the park that evening, so at least I didn't have to focus too much on keeping my bike on the shoulder. Another shot of my watch at the Paradise, about halfway through our 25 minute break. A mile or so shy of Paradise, I insisted that Matt forge ahead and find the car in the overnight lot. He sped off up the hill and out of sight. I couldn't remember how much further it was at that point and figured another few switchbacks were ahead. But almost out of nowhere, I rounded the last bend and saw that Andy and Mike had left the car almost next to the road in a great location. Matt had already pulled our packs out of the back and was scarfing down some food. The time was 7:06 pm and it hadn't even been 2 hours since we'd entered the park. I gingerly hopped off the saddle and stashed my bike on top of the car. It felt good to get off the bike. It felt even better to eat some real food and change out of our sweaty bike clothes. Still, I was extremely concerned about my energy levels and needed to get on the trail to see if I should call off this attempt for the summit. I left the lot 5 minutes ahead of Matt at 7:32 pm and started climbing the asphalt trails above the lodge. As we'd sat down to eat at the car, a fog had rolled in and it was now extremely thick. The maze of trails above Paradise was easier to navigate due to our wanderings on them days earlier, but I was still worried that one of us might take a wrong turn. Everything seemed familiar, though, and my energy levels seemed to be picking up. The muscles I was using now didn't seem to be as ragged as when I was on the bike. Around 6500 ft, the fog broke and my spirits lifted as I looked up toward Rainier. I passed a few climbers coming down the trails and had them relay a message to Matt that I was still ahead of him and would meet him at the Muir snowfield. My legs were feeling stronger and being able to use trekking poles really helped out. A beautiful sunset from just below the Muir snowfield. Matt on the Muir snowfield I crossed Pebble Creek at McClure Rock and washed my face in the crisp water as I waited for Matt. He rounded the bend minutes later and we rested a few more minutes before starting up the snowfield. The snow conditions were actually quite favorable – just hard enough to keep from sloshing around but soft enough not to need crampons. The climb up to Muir seemed to race by and before we knew it, the Muir huts were visible. I raced ahead to find Mike and Andy and arrived at Camp Muir just after 10 pm. The original plan was to have Andy and Mike prep a hot meal and melt some water for us at Muir. Sadly, they had only arrived 30 minutes ahead of us and were just starting up the stove. We set to work getting the meal ready and melting additional water for our summit push. Andy dug around in his pack for a few pieces of climbing gear we'd pawned off on him. I took a visit to the lovely outhouses at Muir and was lucky enough to talk to a couple of climbers who had a spare liter of water to give us. It probably saved us 15 minutes of melting water. We ate, drank, geared up, and set off from Muir just over an hour later. There had been one headlamp crossing the Cowlitz Glacier during our break, but it looked as though we'd beat the rest of the groups out of Muir. Matt took the lead of our two-man rope team and we charged off into the dark just after 11 pm. Matt and I double check our gear before leaving Camp Muir for the summit As we crested the Cathedral Gap, there was still only one light on the route ahead and a bit of activity at the Ingraham Flats camp. We'd left our crampons off for the rocky climb up the gap, so we secured our crampons and set off to get ahead of the groups at the camp. The route across the Ingraham Glacier had become more circuitous in the few days since the dry run as more crevasses had opened. We almost thought we'd gone too high before traversing and dropping back to the base of the Disappointment Cleaver. Luckily, Matt was able to stay on route and we made it to the cleaver without getting lost. The cleaver was a slog, as it had been on the dry run. I hate wearing crampons on rock/sand. We'd discussed removing them a few days prior but decided it would be too much trouble. I watched Matt's crampons spark on the rocks and we started up a conversation as I'd shortened our rope for the cleaver. The conversation actually helped as it distracted me from my increasingly tired legs and a slight headache that had settled in. By the top of the cleaver we really started to slow down. We'd been going strong for over 11 hours and the elevation and cumulative effects of hours of hard activity were starting to show. The headlamp ahead of us on the glacier was encouraging, though, and we pushed on to the switchbacks awaiting us in the dark. Energy was waning fast as we hit 13,000 ft. We could climb for 2-3 minutes but then had to rest for 15-30 seconds. The wind started to pick up and the temperature was now below freezing. Matt and I yelled back and forth, making sure both of us were still warm enough in our minimal clothing. Neither of us really wanted to stop to put on another layer unless we had to. We finally caught up with and passed the solo climber around 13,500 ft. He watched us cross a snowbridge and I offered a belay, but he declined. At this point, we knew we were getting close and I think we subconsciously picked up the pace. Matt told me later that the whole climb between the cleaver and the crater had been mentally taxing; this section had been much easier on the dry run when the sun had started to rise and we could more easily monitor our progress. I think we still made great time, but it did feel like forever. Looking out onto the Emmons Glacier in the twilight from the DC (taken during the descent) Exhausted elation in the middle of the night on the summit of Mount Rainier! The crater rim came into view, and I felt a surge of energy. We were so close! We topped out at 2:34 am and I wound up our rope for the trek across the crater. The last ¼ mile went by in a flash as we pressed on to the summit, though we did stop twice to catch our breath. But in almost no time, we were there. It was 2:44 am, 12 hours 44 minutes 30 seconds since our start at sea level! I let out a hoot and we snapped a quick photo in the dark. Matt waited patiently in the biting wind as I sent a SPOT message to my wife from the summit to let her know we'd made it. I was elated and drained at the same time. We'd pulled it off! Retreating to a calm nook just below the rim, we put on a few more layers and prepped ourselves for the long trek ahead. Our goal had been reached, but we still had 9,000 ft to descend in order to call this trip a success. As we crossed paths with the solo climber in the crater, we offered our congrats and encouragement through the breezy night air. Exhaustion had truly set in as we returned to the east rim of the summit crater – just a few feet of uphill travel showed us just how tired we were. And at this point, all we wanted was a cautious and deliberately slow descent back to Camp Muir, but it would still take lots of energy, especially since we could now see the string of headlamps of the other climbers snaking up the mountain. We'd have to pass them all on one of the steeper parts of the route. We made contact with the first group about 700 ft below the crater and by the time we reached the top of the cleaver, we'd passed between 60 and 70 climbers. Thank goodness we had made it out of Muir/Ingraham camps ahead of them. At the top of Disappointment Cleaver, the solo climber caught up to us, and we chatted for a few minutes. Clif, from Vancouver, B.C., was surprised to catch us as we'd been strong heading up, but seemed to understand our cautious approach to our descent. The sun rises over the Ingraham Glacier and Little Tahoma. Matt rests for a bit as we descend the Cathedral Gap. The rest of the descent down the DC was slow and uneventful. I even had time to snap a few photos of the glowing landscape as the sun rose. We stumbled into Camp Muir at about 6:20 am and crawled into the Muir hut to get a little sleep in just our climbing attire. I was successful and awoke at 9:05 am to find Matt heading out the door. He hadn't slept much and thought he'd have better luck at the car. I stuck around for almost an hour packing and enjoying the sunshine above the clouds with Andy and Mike as they prepped for their ski down the Muir snowfield. Again, Paradise was obscured below the clouds, still hovering around 7,000 ft. By 10 am, the sun had warmed the snow sufficiently and I glissaded much of the way down the Muir snowfield. Another 50 minutes and I was standing at the car, glad that this trip had come to a close at about 11:35 am on July 30. Epilogue Matt and I celebrate the successful summit on the dry run, knowing that most of our journey is still to come. Completing the S2S was one of the hardest things I've done in my life. At the top I was gassed and felt like another step up would have been impossible. And by the end at Camp Muir I was about ready to fall on my face. I could have passed out right there on the Cowlitz Glacier or curled up in a ball on the cleaver if I'd given myself the chance in those last hours of our descent. What made it so difficult? There wasn't any single event, no crux of the climb that was especially taxing or challenging, it was purely the accumulation of activity, hours upon hours, that slowly wore us down. Matt thought the hardest part was knowing just how fast to go, as we traveled at a relatively conservative pace until the last thousand feet or so. I can agree with that and honestly thought I went too fast on the bike, putting the whole trip in jeopardy. But everything seemed to work out just right. Part of that was luck, no doubt, but much of it was years of mental, physical, and emotional preparation. All I can say is I'm glad I did the S2S. Looking back, only a few days ago now, I ask myself, “Why did I do it?” This project, this route had been on my mind for years, slowly building in intensity. For the last few months, it had been my number one priority. But where did it get me? On our S2S climb, I only spent 7 or 8 minutes on the summit of Rainier, a few moments in time. It really was the journey in this case that was important, the hundreds of hours of training, researching routes, finding the perfect equipment, and preparing mentally. It would not have been possible without all that work. But without those few moments at the very top, would I have been satisfied? I doubt it. I would have returned to try the S2S again. I may still return to do it again, to see if I can beat the clock another time. Just not for a couple years... “It was just a moment in the mountains, but enough moments add up to a life.” - Douglas Chadwick, The Wolverine Way Thanks Matt and I attempt to calm the butterflies in our guts seconds before heading for Rainier.

multi-day,A Weekend in the Enchantments: 4 Peaks in a Row,"Introduction ""Where the clouds can go, men can go; but they must be hardy men."" -A. Maurer Last year my brother Michael and Eastking went up Colchuck Peak in Late March which for over a year I been wanting to do. Last week Redwic invited me to join with Gimpilator for a Grand Slam in the Enchantments. Redwic let me stay over at his house which we sorted gear, planned out our routes, and printed off maps. Dragontail Peak from Colchuck Lake We woke up at 2 a.m. for a nice alpine start to head out to the Stuart Lake Trailhead. By the time we got to the trailhead we were all excited by this point. When getting out of the car it was so nice to feel the fresh mountain air again. For the past several weeks I had been stuck at home with tons of homework which I graduated June 9, 2011. The weather was absolutely perfect, we could not have picked a better time to head to the Enchantments. The weekend before people said it was too snowy, and then next weekend permit season was going to start up. The Edge of Enchantment Peak Going for ColchuckAt around 5:30 a.m. we started hiking up the trail to Colchuck Lake which was nice and easy even with a heavy pack. Later up the trail we encountered snow which was mostly solid, views of Dragontail and Colchuck Peak came into view. The first Bridge Crossing Colchuck Peak through the Trees The Second Bridge Crossing At the lake we enjoyed a nice break which I decided was time to enjoy some cream soda. From here we walked around the lake and started the ascent up the Colchuck Glacier. From here on out we gained elevation quite rapidly in fashionable time, to the South we could see Mount Cashmere, Mount Canon, and Aasgard Pass. As we were climbing we chatted with some guides from New York who stayed with us until we reached the Colchuck Col. Sharp Edge on Colchuck Peak Gimpilator Excited for the Climb Climbers with Cashmere in the Background Redwic Heading Up Halfway up the Colchuck Glacier The Views to the South of the Col At the Col we ditched our packs for the summit, by the now the heat of the day was softening up the snow making for a few posthole steps. On the summit of Colchuck we could see clouds moving in which Gimpilator figured we would be in a white out soon, fortunately that never happened. Redwic near the Summit Endless Mountains Looking West Argonaut Peak's North Face Colchuck Peak Summit Panorama Mount Stuart Panorama Descending back to the Col Dragontail from the Col Dragontail's Ridge Heading over to DragontailWe quickly descended Colchuck back to the Col to pick up our packs and went on over to Dragontail. We misunderstood some info we got online and made attempts to avoid the gulley by cutting right to the ridge. This turned out to be a mistake, after topping out of the ridge all we could see were cliffs and a rappel ring which obviously this was not the way. I carefully explored a bit more and ended up having to down climb some class 3, we gave up and went back to the gulley. The Ridge Above Gimpilator checking out the Ridge The gulley was around 45 degrees or so, but by now the snow was soft enough to feel comfortable heading up, which it was glissade worthy. Pretty soon we reached the top at Pandora's Box which we started to wonder where exactly we should go next. Colchuck Peak's East Face Redwic heading up Dragontail Nearing the top of the Gully Mount Stuart Clearing Up The Crux of the Trip Redwic on the Edge After Gimpilator went around the edge of Pandora's Box he spotted a steep snow slope leading to the Dragontail snow field. ""This is it!"" Gimpilator announced, looking over the edge it looked steep, I could see small cliffs and rocks sticking out which did not make me feel good about the slope. At the time I did not even see the cliffs that were below until after we were past the crux. Gimpilator was the first to go down and kick steps which I'm thankful he did this for us. He stayed perfectly quiet which we figured was him feeling fine but he later said he needed full focus. When Redwic went through he seemed worried at first but then seemed less nervous when almost near the bottom of the crux. Redwic Heading Down the Crux Redwic seen from Below Then it was my turn, I was a bit nervous heading onto the down climb slope but was trying to remain calm. After a few steps down I instantly realized the seriousness of the slope below and the dangers of the cliffs. I now was putting as much effort as possible to kick steps in further, and began to feel vertigo. I don't mind heights, but when my life is on the line, I become quite scared. ""Relax"" I whispered to myself as I went over the crux of the crux (the middle was the steepest part). As I went down my middle and index finger began to go numb as well as my toes which when stepping in I could not feel exactly how far in my foot was in. On top of this I was carrying a over night pack and began to have cramps, this reminded me an awful deal of how Sahale was (although not as bad). I became more worried when I saw how easy my ice axe plopped out of the snow, which I knew that my axe was no longer my life line, my footing now was everything. Redwic every now and then would yell out encouragements which I tried smiling while knowing that I had to get off the slope soon. On my next step I saw part of the step break, this did not make me feel any better. If I had known how the slope would have been perhaps I would have not even attempted going down, but as far as we knew at the time this was the only way to Dragontail from Colchuck. After taking more careful steps I was out of the crux which I felt much better, it was among the top 5 scariest things I have ever done. In mountaineering you always got to be in control, when I'm not, that's when I start to panic. If I was either roped up or had an ice tool I would have felt much safer descending. From here it was a nice easy traverse onto the Dragontail snowfield. Me Descending the Crux The Easy Pathway to Dragontail Peak From Dragontail to CampFrom here it was smooth sailing, the summit of Dragontail from here was relatively easy. At the summit it was a bit cliffy which I quickly touched the summit and went back a few feet to eat (I did not feel comfortable unlike Gimpilator being on the top rock on the summit for a while). Soon we started our descent which I got a nice glissade down to a mini pass. From here we went left down to Aasgard Pass, the snow was punchy making progress slow. Mount Daniel above the Clouds Enchantment Basin Below Dragontail Peak Panorama The Jagged Ridges of Dragontail Peak Heading Down to the Basin Little Annapurna By the time we reached the bottom I could see my knees were all cut up from the ice crystals from falling in many snow holes. We were all pleased to be in the Enchantment basin which is where we put our camp at. After setting up camp I decided to be the cook which in a sense was nice because I got to enjoy the sunset and evening colors over the mountains around us. Sunset on McClellan Peak Our Campsite Sunset on the Rocks Evening in the Enchantment Basin In the morning it was a bright sunny day, when grabbing my boots from outside they were too frozen for me to get my feet into (they loose flexibility). Redwic had to put my boots out in the sun to help thaw them out. In the mean time we boiled more water and I enjoyed some top ramen in the tent. Pretty soon my boots were flexible enough for me to squeeze them on, and pretty soon we were on the move. Next Stop Little Annapurna! Dragontail Peak with Isolation Lake We started out crossing Isolation Lake, I was a little worried with the idea of crossing a lake which had pools of water on the West side of the lake, but we did see foot prints of people who crossed it in mid day, we were crossing it in early morning. Once across we started heading up the slope of Little Annapurna, which turns out to be the easiest of the peaks we climbed during the trip. Aasgard Pass Witches Tower Gimpilator heading up Little Annapurna Looking Down on Enchantment Basin On top of Little Annapurna we looked over to figure out our exact route up Enchantment Peak, and of course had our selves a mini celebration. Blue Ridges from Little Annapurna Redwic on Little Annapurna Little Annapurna's Spires Little Annapurna Panorama Redwic Glissading Down Little Annapurna Our Final Destination: Enchantment PeakThis peak was perhaps the most out of the way, but was certainly a fun one. We descended down the North East Side of Little Annapurna to Inspiration Lake and onto Prusik Pass with a slightly different variation. Along the way we got a very nice place to refill our water and refresh ourselves. From here we then ascended on up to Enchantment Peak which at first we went for one of the false summits by mistake. Enchantment Peak Panorama Prusik Peak Gimpilator leading the Way The Real Summit of Enchantment Peak We then back tracked and went for the East summit which we believe to be the real one. The ending had a bit of class 3 section which Gimpilator calls it ""The Ladder"" because there were nice foot holds although not for the fearful of heights. We were all very pleased to get this summit, but as we looked over we could see incoming clouds which there was potential rain coming in. Gimpilator near the Summit Redwic at the bottom of the Climb Little Annapurna with Clouds The Return Trip Gimpilator glissading Down The way down was a nice big glissade to the lake, and then we had to go up hill once again to get to base camp. We decided to cross around the lake now that it was late in day. At base camp we relaxed for a little while and then packed everything for the return trip down Aasgard Pass. My feet were finally dry from changing my socks but sure enough not 100 feet from camp I fall in 2 snow holes and end up getting my feet wet again. At Aasgard Pass there was a nice glissade to the lower part of the pass, on the way down there was a hidden rock which hurt a bit, but fortunately nothing serious. Gimpilator with Cashmere Peak The Glissade Down Aasgard Pass Looking up the Glissade After looking over the edge I was almost drooling at how nice the glissade ahead looked, I down climbed 200 feet where it was harder snow, but once it got soft, man I was flying down the mountain! 1,000 feet later I decide to wait up for the team, and then go down another 1,000 feet in high speed. At the lake we then get back on trail. From here I had some good conversations with Redwic and Gimpilator and it was a nice mellow walk down to the trailhead. Cashmere with Colchuck Lake Thanks guys for taking me, this was a great experience and beautiful place. I would recommend this to any peak bagger who wants both big peaks and adventure!

Thanks Redwic, you did great on this trip. It was a big accomplishment for all of us! As for trying to prove we all had a good time, I wrote at the end of the trip report that I had a great time, you would know if you had a great time, and Gimpilator's video made it pretty clear that he had a good time. So I think that is proof enough to me that we all had a great time! ;-) Snidely Whiplash - Jun 20, 2011 12:25 pm - Voted 10/10 Well done! Way to go. That's an epic trip.

You have some great pictures of some famous peaks I have always heard about. Showing you guys in different parts of the route going up or down really makes the viewer feel like he is there. A great report and some inspiring photos. Josh Lewis - Jun 23, 2011 5:54 pm - Hasn't voted Re: great photos Thanks Mike, I'm glad to hear that. The Cascades are certainly a worthy visit, if you ever do come to these parts, be sure to visit the North Cascades National Park. As for the pics of people, I decided to take a new approach to my photography, in the past I would rarely photograph people, but my brother would complain to me about that. So I figured adding people to the photo would make it seem more personal. Plus the person in the photo I'm sure is pleased. Sierra Ledge Rat - Jun 22, 2011 12:08 am - Voted 10/10 Groovy! ""In mountaineering you always got to be in control, when your not, that's when I start to panic."" I've spent a lot of time going up and down steep slopes, up when I was brave, down when I wasn't, all the while fighting panic. Sometimes I made the summit, sometimes I didn't. Love the glissading pics! Josh Lewis - Jun 23, 2011 5:57 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Groovy! It's a true fact. The more I live through exposure, the more I realize how vulnerable I am, and in a sense the next time I go I'm even more frightened. Most people it is the opposite, but for me I think its good sense kicking in. I've lived through some dangerous mountaineering in my time, and try to avoid it when ever possible. So sometimes it's hard to balance just right between perils and adventure. Because I do have to say I'm very adventurous at the same time!

multi-day,A Blessing in Disguise,"IntroductionThis trip certainly was a defining moment for me in my ever so fast paced and quickly evolving mountaineering career. Here I would be tested mentally and I needed to use my previous experience and knowledge to make this trip the success it was, despite not making the summit. I had been getting messages on the NWHikers forum from someone who has been wanting to go on a climb. However since he was a true vagabond he wasn't up in northern Washington until later in September. The time finally came when he made his way north and I tried to think of a potential group of Bulgers in the North Cascades we could do knowing he was new to snow travel and such. I thought about the Ragged Ridge Traverse, Mount Logan, Golden Horn and Tower Mountain but I finally decided halfway to Burlington that we should do Primus Peak. This decision was both good and bad but turned out to be a huge blessing in disguise. Below is the story about our adventure and a good accomplishment for me despite missing the summit. Starting OutWe made our way to the Thunder Creek Trailhead where we gathered up our things and started up the trail pretty quickly. Paul was carrying a whole lot of stuff and after 15 minutes on the trail he realized he forgot his food in the car. I thought to myself how that was possible he was already carrying almost as much as he could carry. So I wait for him to go grab his food and he comes back with an enormous bag of homemade yams, apples, pears and bananas. Now he did tell me he never eats wheat or grain products so I expected him to bring fruits and veggies however he brought enough to feed an army for over a week! As we continued up the trail it was very evident we were not going to make the climb up the steep ridge of Tricouni Peak that day so we decided to just hike to the McAllister camp after seven miles and bring bivy gear up the ridge the next day. Thank goodness there is a bridge over Thunder Creek here or no one would ever get across this raging river like creek! I told Paul he needed to leave half his stuff and food behind or he would never make it. So we rolled into camp, cooked a nice meal, built a six foot cairn along Thunder Creek and went quickly to sleep. The weather was very warm and the sky was clearing. The dense canopy of trees made it dark much earlier than I had been used to all summer long. But the season was winding down and the days were getting shorter. After a nice rest, we re-packed, hung the spare food and started up the long, long ridge. This ridge is technically called the ""lower north ridge of Tricouni Peak"" and it sure is a real pain in the ass. We ascended 800 feet on a steep boot path (which was a surprise to find) to an opening where we saw our first views across McAllister Creek towards Snowfield Peak. This climb just got steeper as we had to skirt around a series of cliffs but eventually we got to an area where the trees were very small and very close together where the terrain flattened slightly. But it got worse quickly and the worst part of the climb was an area of bad slide alder right before a big view point. We stood atop a nice rock for our first panoramic views of the trip. I was in awe at the immense beauty I was looking at. I was home... Just beyond this viewpoint, the ridge became flat for a ways where the boot path was harder to follow. I just stayed on the crest of the ridge and when it steepened once again the trees began to thin out and we started to see much more color. This was what I had been waiting over two years for! Finally I got to see for myself the true Cascades fall foliage. First I saw bright red in the maples down low, then the small bushes closer to treeline were orange and red and finally, as we rolled into the bivy site at the base of Tricouni Peak I saw my very first golden larch trees. Looking down the ridge we just came up Perfect fall foliage Paul setting up camp I was speechless and at a loss for words at what I was seeing. Certainly far more beautiful than anything I have seen in Colorado. When the nice soft dirt and shrubs turned into rock and talus on the ridge we located the bivy site and set up shop for the night. By the nature of the clouds that afternoon I knew we were in for a sunset of just epic proportions. So I waited and relaxed at one of the best places I have ever been. A beautiful green colored lake lie at the base of the dying Borelis Glacier. The route up to lucky pass looked difficult at best and I was unable to locate a nice route up through the ice or the loose rock to the climbers left which was to my disappoint but in a place this beautiful, I could hardly complain. I was so in awe about the beauty the summit just seemed secondary. The Reason I Climb...There are many reasons why I climb mountains however one of the biggest reasons is to see for myself the wonders of this Earth we live on. I am not going to say much because words cannot describe what I saw during those next 15 hours. The phrase a picture is worth a thousand words carries great weight here and I invite you to enjoy for yourself the beauty of this place that I want to share through my photos. Although they do no justice, I hope they can bring joy to others during the holiday season. They are the best photos I got in 2012 which says a whole lot because I have been to a lot of places this year. The Sunset Snowfield Peak Alpenglow Sunset over Mount Logan Mount Logan at its best At a loss of words Tricouni Peak Primus Peak Sunset Snowfield Peak Tricouni Peak Sunset North Cascades Mount Logan Sunset Panorama Black Peak, Ragged Ridge and Fisher Creek Primus and Tricouni Peaks The Sunrise We slept under the stars that night and it was very moist in the air. It was a bright full moon but at times we saw fog roll through. Our stuff was very wet and frosty the next morning but this sunrise ranked the best sunrise I have ever seen without a shadow of a doubt. The crystal clear air, the gorgeous colors, the fog below us in the valley, and the rugged peaks surrounding us all came together perfectly. Primus Peak Sunrise Snowfield Peak and fog The perfect Cascades Sunrise complete with valley fog Sunrise with Jack Mountain Snowfield Peak Snowfield Peak Borelis Lake Sunrise over Fisher Creek North Cascades Sunrise Panorama My Primus AttemptPaul decided he wanted to stay back and relax but I had to at least make an attempt at climbing Primus Peak. With the route to Lucky Pass out, the standard east ridge which is nothing more than a walk wasn't available. I scouted out other options. The north ridge from what I was able to see from our bivy didn't look too bad so I started by hiking east around Borelis Lake and climbing up to the crest of the North Ridge. I went up beautiful meadow land with alpine larches at their peak which then turned into gentle snow slopes until I reached the crest of the north ridge. The gentle look of this ridge I saw from camp changed into a jagged, serrated loose pile of crap ridge that certainly was at least 4th class. So I decided to cross over and try to find a way up on the west side of the ridge. I tried traversing the rock above the unnamed glacier on the peaks NW side to no avail. This rock was all very loose and I even sent a big one tumbling down the glacier. Next I tried travering in the big moat trying to get to the West ridge which I knew was only class 3. However I ran into bullet ice on the rock from dripping snow above me and I could not risk falling deeper into the moat and risk getting stuck deep under the glacier to freeze to death. I was already underneath massive amounts of snow as it was. So I retreated and tried to traverse the glacier on the edge at the surface. If someone was with me this would have been very easy as I could have just traversed across to the west ridge and scrambled to the summit. Although I may have been fine doing it solo especially since the snow was so hard I just didn't want to walk across a glacier alone. The west ridge was so close but I saw huge cracks in the glacier and knew if I went across and something broke it wasn't survivable. Without further adieu, I tried my final option...the North Ridge direct. I knew nothing about the route but inside I hoped it wasn't 5th class. I started my way up the really loose rock and quickly made some 4th class moves. The exposure was increasing dramatically as I ascended. I got to a notch and traversed left onto the east side to avoid a cliff but soon came to a steep jump in the ridge that was most certainly 5th class. With no one to belay me I was stuck. The route looked 5.6 with no alternatives so I was forced to retreat. I even had to set up a couple rappel anchors as I had climbed up things I didn't want to down climb. Luckily I brought my 30 meter alpine rope with me which came in handy. I conceded and allowed Primus Peak the victory this time but noted I would be back during a weaker time for the mountain...when it is sealed closed under lots of snow. Late September is just way to late in the season in this area. With that the case though, I still captured part of Primus Peaks' soul within my photos that I hope you enjoy. Primus and Larches Borelis Lake Borelis Lake and Red Mountain Tricouni Peak and Larches Alpine Larches The icy route to Lucky Pass Borelis Lake Primus Peak I think you're getting the idea Looking down on the N Ridge Looking across the unnamed glacier I needed to cross The ReturnSo I retreated back down to camp where I met up with Paul once again. He had a great time relaxing and enjoying the scenery. He was very happy to have joined on the trip and was satisfied with his time in Washington. We talked a lot about where he was going to be headed in the next couple years. He had plans to head to South America, Europe and Asia and was traveling the world. I was very envious. We started back down the ridge (which I was NOT looking forward to descending) and almost instantly we got off route and into major bushwhacking. Why is it that going down you always manage to miss the route I don't know but for some reason it always happens. We had to side hill on very steep bushy terrain to get back to the ridge crest and continue down the right way. We got back to the flat section of ridge and quickly made our way across. The rest of the descent was long and uneventful all the way back to McAllister camp where it got dark on us and we spent a second night there. The next morning we packed up and hiked the 7 miles to the car. As I said, although I didn't summit anything on this trip and upon reaching the car I branded this trip a failure, I soon realized especially after reviewing the photos at home that this was one of the best trips of the year for me. This was a blessing in disguise. See below for a map of Primus Peak and its routes and our approach.

single-day,The Struggling Bear on Blowout Mountain,"The Struggling Bear on Blowout  MountainIt had been a long since I have been on a hike with my husband EastKing. This is largely due to the fact I have fibromyalgia and do not do well in the recent surge of extreme heat that has hit the Pacific Northwest this summer. I have deteriorated dramatically in terms of any progress with my weight with it now over a very negative milestone and that has been hard to swallow emotionally. I know I have to take more action to do something about it but I know it is going to be hard to find any hiking partners who are patient enough to go and who would be willing to endure my slowness and current physical limitations. I may struggle now I but I soon hope not to struggle as bad in the future. Our Route BearQueen on the move through the huckleberries! I was very slow on the hike up this mountain. EastKing could not have picked a better mountain to go up but my fatigue and recent weight gain was making this mountain a real struggle. I could feel the pain from the lack of hiking I have done this year. After all how can a 5 mile, 800 foot elevation gain walk-up with no scrambles be so hard? Despite all the struggles heading up the mountain, I really LOVED this trail. It is so scenic and beautiful. What really made it stand out was all of the thousands and thousands of spruce trees that dot the landscape, making it look like a tranquil wonderland in summer.  It would have been complete if waterfalls were dotting the landscape, but one cannot have everything!  The total hike is high on the ridge so there are not any good water sources on this trail. There were huckleberry bushes all along the trail and they were in season. Eating these huckleberries made EastKing and I take longer going up to this summit and coming back. Hooray!!! The views on the summit of Blowout Mountain are SO REWARDING. Outside of a couple trees in some spots, the views here were completely panoramic. To the north lied distant view of Stuart, Daniel, and hundreds of mountains that I can only dream about getting to the top of. Rainier was unfortunately covered by clouds but the mountains to the east of Rainier were out and very beautiful. At the very top of the mountain lies an amazing rock to sit on and enjoy the views. Getting to the summit was so WONDERFUL after the summer I have been having and EastKing and I really savored the view from the summit and spent some real quality time together, which we needed. The summit rock of Blowout Mountain Mount Stuart from the summit I personally find the dirt road that is at least seven miles up to being very nerve-wracking.  The initial part of the road has potholes, but then it evens out, but the road gets steeper and curves around the mountain with more exposure. For those of us with vertigo, it is scary at times. The road is in decent shape and is doable with a passenger car but it can be narrow in places which terrified me. Evening sunsets on this road can be dangerous so wait until the sun is below the horizon before taking this road back down. At times we were blinded by the sun on the way back. Looking east EastKing enjoying the view! I have to say that I really need all of the emotional support and encouragement that I can get from other hikers.  I am now at a dangerous weight and I am the heaviest weight I have ever been that is a culmination of many different things and I am already beating myself up for it. If you read this and want to on some really easy but beautiful hikes, let me know. I am motivated to keep moving and getting outside and have a good list of smaller mountains that I want to do this year. Hopefully I one day will be able to write up a much better adventure in the future. Maybe one day I will stand on some of these summits!!

multi-day,"Why they call 'em the Goat Rocks, and a tale of separation.","The ApproachI've had my eye on the Goat Rocks in southern Washington for some time now. My first idea was a solo trip to Cold Lake and a summit of Tieton Peak, but I had to cancel those plans due to bad weather. Two weeks later, a promising forecast, a three day weekend, and partner to share the trip with were enough to finally explore this wonderful area. My main scrambling partner of the last two years and I took a Friday off from work and drove the 3 hours from Portland to the Snowgrass Trailhead. Our plan was to hike trail 96 and cutoff trail 97 to the PCT and make our way to Cispus Basin. From here we would set up camp and scrabmle as many peaks as we could over the weekend. I ended up having my best experience in Washington's mountains so far, and learned some lessons about hydration, route finding, and staying with your partner. Goat Rocks from the PCT Trevin on the PCT Trevin and I left Portland at a leisurely 8:45 am on Friday morning and drove to the Snowgrass Trailhead. We arrived at about 11:30 and were promptly greeted by a gentle misting of mosquitoes. After a less than refreshing shower of DEET we threw our packs on and headed out on the trail. The first couple miles slowly descended to a bridged river crossing, and then began to gain elevation as we made our way to Snowgrass Flats. About a mile after we started to gain elevation, Trevin began to move a little more slowly. Shortly after that we had to stop to rest as he was feeling dizzy and lightheaded. ""I've never felt like this before"" he said as we waited for the dizzyness to subside. Without going into details for his sake, we peiced together that he was probably dehydrated from an illness the previous two days. Since we had more than enough time, we took it slow and made sure he drank plenty of water as we made our way towards our destination. About a mile and a half from Snowgrass Flats, we ran into an older couple who were returning from a summit of Ives Peak. They gave us a brief synopsis of the Ives trail and a heads up that there were several ""impassable"" waterfalls ahead. Soon after we parted ways we discovered what they were talking about. After scampering over a couple easy creek crossings we came across a moderately difficult one. It took about 8 steps to cross and required some careful foot and trekking pole placements, but we made it across without wet feet. As we approached the PCT's crossing of the Cispus River we took note of a couple deer grazing in the meadow below and began to look for the established camp site located at this crossing. We didn't see it right away and began to hike up the western slopes of Cispus Basin looking for a place to set up camp. Why They Call 'em the Goat Rocks Mountain Goat and Kid I was a couple hundred feet above Trevin when I spotted a mountain goat and his / her kid. I froze so I didn't startle them and pulled out my camera for a couple pictures. After a few seconds of staring at me, they began to scamper off. I wasn't satisfied with the pictures I had taken, so I threw off my pack and gave chase. I hadn't seen a moutain goat in over a year and the sight of the goat and it's kid gave me a burst of energy I didn't know was possible. As quickly and as quietly as possible I sprinted after them, snapping a few more decent pictures before they finally lost me. At this point I was at about 6800 feet and when I looked up the ridge and saw a dozen more goats making their way west across a flat spot around 7400 feet. Goats on the move! I snapped some photos, and then sprinted back to where I had dumped my pack to find Trevin. He had never seen mountain goats before so I was eager to show them to him. He was pretty exhaused when I found him, but he slowly made it up to the 6800 point where I had last seen them. They were gone. I suggested skirting around the ridge to see if we could spot them coming out on the other side, but he wasn't up for it. I went by myself and saw 6-7 more heading back east, one of which had a yellow tracker box around his neck. I came back around the ridge and Trevin and I made our way back to where we had left our packs. He was pretty tired and still dehydrated, so we just decided to set up camp there. He pulled out his air mattress and rested while went to get a bucket of water for us. As I was filling up I looked over at the slopes just to the west of ""the"" goat rocks and was completely shocked to see 40 more goats hanging out on the scree!!! Goats galore! (zoom in) I had seen maybe 10 mountain goats in my entire life and had just quintupled that number in the matter of 20 to 30 minutes. I ran back up to camp and pointed out the goats to Trevin. We sat there and watched them scramble around for about half and hour until they eventually made their way over the pass to the north. After another hour of rest and about 4 liters of water in Trevin's stomach (he was kinda thirsty...) we loaded up our day packs and make our way up to the pass we had seen the goats on. When we got to the pass there were no goats to be seen so we looked around for some peaks to summit. Trevin was curious if there was any class 3 or 4 routes on the NW end of ""the"" goat rocks, which was just east of the pass we were at. I offered to scramble up the scree to the base of the rocks to check it out while he rested. He took me up on the offer and I made my way up. Tieton Peak and Goats Family Day in the Goat Rocks As I reached a high spot, I startled 6 or so goats resting there. Two took of to the north, and four went east toward the rock formations. I snapped a couple photos and quietly crept north following the two goats making sure to step on the large rocks instead of the scree as to not disturb or startle any other goats that might be in the area. As I reached a point where the valley to the north along with Tieton Peak came into view I discovered where the 40 goats we had seen earlier ran off to. They were all hanging out on a sandy flat spot about 30 feet in front of me. I was successful in not startling the goats, but my scent gave me away and they eventually took notice of my presence. Most of them occasionally glanced over at me as I took pictures, but a few of the parent goats decided to take their kids across a snow field to leave the area. Not wanting to break up the goat convention, I quietly retreated after I had a few good pics to remember the experience. Day One's Scrambling View E-SE from Ives After seeing the goats and quickly and easily determining that there were no safe scrambling opportunities in the area, Trevin and I headed west and summited peak 7476. It was a short and easy class 2/3 hike up to the summit and had amazing views of Ives Peak, Old Snowy, McCall Glacier, and Rainier off in the distance. Ives, Old Snowy, and Rainier We determined that we had about 3-4 hours of daylight left and after some discussion, I was able to convince Trevin to scramble over and summit Ives via the east ridge. ""Ok..."" he said, ""but don't be surprised if I tell you I hate you in an hour and a half."" I smiled and we made our way down to the saddle between 7476 and Ives, then over to Ives' east ridge. Apparently there is some sort of trail up to the summit, but from where we were at we decided to just stick to the rocks and boulders. This was a pretty fun scramble. Most of it was class 3 on solid predictable boulders, but I was able to find a couple sections of class 4 rock to scramble up for some extra challenge and enjoyment. The view from the summit was truly amazing! Of all the peaks I summited over this weekend, this view had to be the best. Trevin also agreed with me. He said ""Do you remember when I said I was going to hate you in an hour and a half? Well, I was wrong... this is awesome!"" We soaked in the views for a few minutes and then headed back to camp. We cooked some food while I played guitar, enjoyed a wonderful sunset, and stared at the stars until we went to bed at 11:00. Goat Rocks Massif Peak 6735 and Adams Day Two: a Tale of Seperation Camp in Cispus Basin We slept in super late in the morning and got up at 9:00. We ate some breakfast, packed up our daypacks, and headed out to climb some more peaks. The primary goal for the day was to climb Gilbert Peak, the tallest in the Goat Rocks. I also had my eye on peak 6735 to the south of Cispus Pass ever since we got there, so we decided to start with that one. Peak 6735 We made our way around Cispus Basin and hiked up a snow crease eventually topping out on peak 6872. It was at this point I wish we would have done things a little differently. Looking south along the ridgeline towards peak 6735, Trevin decided it wasn't worth it to him to go down, up, down, and up again just to climb peak 6735. I, on the other hand, was all about it and didn't want to leave the area without climbing it. After thinking about the situation we came up with a few ideas: He could wait on 6872 for me to summit and return, or we could both go to Gilbert now and I could run over and tag 6735 on the way back. He didn't like either of these as they both involved him waiting for me at some point. We finally decided that he would start heading toward Gilbert and I would head over to 6735, summit it, and catch up to him when I could. I usually hike a good deal faster than him so it sounded like a good idea. This turned out to be not such a good idea as the route over to Gilbert was a class 3 traverse where good route finding was needed to avoid class 4 and 5 terrain. More on that in a second. I wanted to bag peak 6735 as quickly as possible so I literally ran along the ridge over to the base of the peak. As I approached the north ridge of 6735 it looked a little steeper than I had imagined, but looked well within my ablities. I began to scramble up the class 3/4 ridge which was pretty fun until about 70 feet below the summit. Here it got a little steeper and I decided I had better try and find an easier route up. I traversed to the left across some dirty ledges and eventually found a comfortalbe scramble to summit. It was a pretty fun climb all in all, but could easily get ugly if your route finding and decision making are poor. I didn't want to down climb the north ridge so I went south, wrapped around the west face, and traversed the snow and scree below the cliffs. It sucked. I slipped once on the snow and scraped my knee a little and the footing on the scree was terrible. Eventually I just glissaded down a snow patch and over to a grassy area where I re-gained the ridge and made my way back up to peak 6872 where I had left Trevin. We had discussed the route to take over to Gilbert... stick to the band of white aggragate, follow the goat path, etc. so I had a pretty good idea where he would be. I made my way down to the base of the rocks and started to make my way up. Goat Rocks from Peak 6735 As I started to climb, the terrain around me looked a little intimidating. Solid footing and hand holds are plentiful, but are difficult to pick out through all the loose rock and dirt with out a good eye for route finding. About 20 minutes into the climb I hear Trevin's voice calling my name from just up ahead. ""Sweet!"" I thought, ""I'm catching up to him quicker that I thought!"" I responded with a ""Yeah!?"" and continued on looking for him. Five minutes later I hear him again, but this time behind me. I turned around and saw him on a ledge below and behind me. I yelled out ""What are you doing?"" and he replied ""I got stuck man, this sucks! I kept running into class 5 sh**... I almost died twice! I'm heading back."" We both just stood there for about 10 minutes. I wasn't having any trouble finding my way across the rock, but Trevin obviously was and didn't want to continue. He was almost to the base of the rocks so I asked him if he could find a safe route down. He said he would be ok, so he continued down and I continued up. This is a really confusing traverse with all the spires, gullies, and undulating terrain. I knew the route was to traverse across the white aggragate and avoid going up too much, but as I continued there was no obvious path to follow so I went up anyway as it was more comfortable. It turned out ok as I just had to descend some snow and scree for a couple hundred feet to reach the final saddle below Gilbert Peak. The rest of the way was just a class 2 dirt and rock march up to the final class 3 summit block. I hit the summit, took a self photo from the west summit, ate an energy bar and headed back the way I came. Marmot Gilbert Peak Self Photo I actually had more fun on the downclimb than on the way up. I took basically the same route back, but dropped down one of the earlier gullies and traversed my way back to the pass. I had a blast route finding on the way down, stoping every 50 steps or so to look for the path with the most solid footing... down climbing is fun! Once I gained the pass I made my way back through the snow and found Trevin safely at camp. Although I had a really fun time the second day, Trevin felt it was the ""scarriest and stupidest thing I (he) had ever done"". We both learned some valuable lessons that day. I was disappointed to hear my climbing partner of the last two years say that a climb I enjoyed so much was hell for him. When we were on top of peak 6872 and decided to go seperate ways, I figured he would be able to navigate through the class 3 terrain with out any problems. We had been on a dozen or so scrambles together including the Big Gully route of Castle Peak, ID and other challenging scrambles and hadn't had any problems like this before. After the trip when I got to thinking about the situation I realized that it was route finding ability that made this climb so difficult for him. Usually when we hike together I'm a little faster so I end up going first with him following. That leaves most of the route finding on the trips we do up to me which I am pretty comfortalbe with, but has robbed him of the valuable experience of finding the safest route up a given peak. Had we simply stuck together I know for a fact that he would have been able to complete the traverse as he is a very good climber. Fortunately his decision making is top notch and he was able to turn back without getting himself hurt or worse. Next time we scramble together, we're sticking together... and I think I'll let him lead. Images View Why they call 'em the Goat Rocks, and a tale of separation.

single-day,Getting Back Into the Swing of Things: Triple Couloirs Car to Car,"Introduction Due to serious head aches, pain, and getting busy I haven't written a climbing report in a long time. Fortunately things have gotten better, been working out, going on 5 mile runs, eating healthier, losing weight, becoming a lightweight-aholic (gear wise), and am back on the road to alpinism. January Will and I climbed the North Buttress Couloir of Colchuck as a starter kit for the year. Avalanches, bad weather, sickness, and extreme pain had it's vengeance February through April. Rather than throwing my hands up I kept training, stayed motivated, and sought after the opportune moment to get my first multi pitch ice lead in. Triple Couloirs has been on my to do list for a long time, definitely a great route. With 6840 feet of gain, 20 miles, 18.5 hours of hiking & climbing, 4 pitches, and a lot of kicking in steps it made for a good work out. Triple Couloirs Diagram We woke up at 4:15 a.m. and were hiking up the 4 mile road by 4:45 a.m. There wasn't snow until the last 1/3 mile. As others have mentioned the trail is completely solid making the hike to Colchuck Lake luxurious. After the second creek crossing shortly beyond the Stuart Lake junction we re-filled our water. Making excellent time walking across the lake, felt refreshing to have the entire place to ourselves. At the base of the route we put on our harnesses, crampons, and ice tools. I was extremely pleased that the route was in. Hiking up to Colchuck Lake Coolwars and Ice Battles The ramp had alright snow conditions, some ice/snice, with occasional tool placement failures due to soft snow. Inside the first couloir the snow climbing felt cozier while having dazzling theatrics above. At the top of the couloir we enter the Runnels which is when things started spicining up. It was the beginning of the ominous sound track the mountains play as the day progresses. Ice chunks coming down, loud humming of snow/rock chunks, and small doses of spin drift. I dug a small ledge just wide enough to setup a belay. As Thatcher setup the anchor, I did an alpine dance to regain feeling into my toes and fingers. Colchuck Peak's North Face Thatcher with Cashmere Mountain Buttresses on Enchantment Peak Looking up the stair case to the first Couloir Climbing the First Couloir The first pitch went well, was able to get a nut in the wall followed by two snow pickets for the anchor. The second pitch is when things got more exciting, was torn between which runnel to climb. I choose the one on the right, the left one was probably better. The ice was thin in a few places and sloppy in others. Fortunately was able to find a spot that would accept a screw. After climbing another 50 feet higher I looked around for another potential protection placement, non could be found. The crux was a little tricky due to softening snow, ice tool placements were iffy at times making it essential to kick in good steps. ""Impeccable timing"" I sigh to myself as my legs cramp up. After taking a few deep breathes I carefully climb over the crux. As the rope length ran out I desperately looked around for a place to setup a belay. Every ice screw placement either hit rock or broke due to loose snow. Seeing that I was out of options I used a last resort move which was to bury my ice tools and compress the snow around it. After stress loading it and giving it hard pulls, the anchor seemed strong enough to hold a non lead fall. For further protection my legs were anchored in so that I could bear some of the weight as a precaution. The Runnels Topping out of the Crux Thatcher made it up the pitch in good time, he took the lead for the second couloir which we simul climbed. Felt amazing to follow steps in such an exciting environment and be head ache free. As the snow softened more we heard the roar of a small avalanche on the mountain adjacent to us. Seeing that it was getting late I took the lead up the third couloir past the Aasgardian Gendarme. As we topped out I could see weather was coming in. The traverse to the summit was mellow, albeit I had to watch out for the cornice near the summit. Climbing the Second Couloir Topping out of the Second Couloir Dramatic Spires rise above the Triple Couloirs Climbing below the Dragon Sword Topping out of Triple Couloirs Mount Stuart and Sherpa Peak Let's Book it Out of food, water, and time we didn't spend long on the summit. Looking below I could see our descent route had nasty cornices making for a potentially precarious descent. As we near the Dragon Col I start picking up the vibe that a potentially deadly cornice is blocking the route. Luckily there was a slightly steep escape ramp that bypassed the standard route making for an easy descent down to Enchantment's basin. Was able to get a few glissades in around Aasgard Pass. At Colchuck Lake we could see that significant melting had occurred, near the end of the lake our foot prints were already submerged in water. Thatcher discovered that we could refill our bottles from the lake itself which was very exciting news for our parched lips. Cornices along our escape route The Route we considered McClellan Peak with Gloomy Weather Cross the lake at first was iffy. Our steps sank further in to the point of soaking my boots with blue water. After becoming unreasonable I announce ""I'm out"". While walking along the shore we found that the western shore was more solid, making it a viable option for crossing. Keeping a fair distance from each other we walked across the lake. After getting off the lake we hiked down the icy and slushy trail in evening light. Was interested to see it transition rapidly back and forth. Just beyond the trailhead Thatcher put on his approach shoes while I walked down in my mob buckets. Needless to say we were extremely pleased to arrive at the car.

multi-day,No Small Effort For Big Horn,"PROLOGUEOf the 20 most technically difficult county highpoints in the contiguous United States, also known as “Apex” county highpoints, seven are located in Washington. Of those seven peaks, I was fortunate enough to have summited two of the most technically difficult, Mount Olympus and Bonanza Peak, at the beginning of July. After those trips were completed I only required summiting two more peaks, Big Horn and Mount Baker, to complete the Washington County Highpoints. Of those two peaks, Big Horn is considered to be much more technically difficult than Mount Baker. In fact, many people consider the “crux” move near the summit of Big Horn to be the most difficult crux move of any county highpoint in the contiguous United States. I knew that Big Horn would likely be my last big obstacle before completing the Washington County Highpoints list. Big Horn Looms Above Cispus Basin I began seriously considering an attempt of Big Horn starting the previous year. My biggest concern was not the peak itself but rather who I would make an attempt with. Due to my own inability to lead rock climbs at this stage, I immediately knew that I would need to find a competent rope leader who would be comfortable in that role. However, most of my county highpointer friends had already summited the peak and I was not aware of any person willing to summit the peak twice. Knowing that few people outside of county highpointers attempt Big Horn, I began wondering if finding the right team for a successful summit attempt might be more challenging than actually summiting the peak itself. If I was to be a part of any potential summit team for Big Horn I wanted to make certain that I would be with the right people for such an endeavor. The people would need a variety of mountaineering experience and skills, and perhaps more importantly would need to be people who I could completely trust to be with on such a technical peak. The Horns Of Goat Rocks (Big Horn In Center) As luck would have it, I was invited to join a potential summit party. The group was to consist of several mountaineers: Adam Helman (who for the remainder of this trip report will be referred to only as Adam), Greg Slayden, Adam Walker (who for the remainder of this trip report will be referred to only as Gimpilator), Eric Noel, and I. Adam needed Big Horn as part of his quest to summit each of the county highpoints in the western United States. Greg had summited Big Horn during early July 2007 despite suffering from an accident during the ascent, and was surprisingly willing to go back one more time (which virtually nobody does with Big Horn) to lead our group. Moreover, because Adam had done much of the planning for their successful mountaineering trip in South America earlier during the year, Greg wanted to help return the favor to him. Gimpilator was not a county highpointer and had little knowledge of Big Horn outside of what I had mentioned to him on several occasions, but he had always wanted to visit the Goat Rock Wilderness Area where Big Horn is located. Eric unexpectedly backed-out of the team several days prior to trip due to other commitments, and after his departure we kept the team small and intact to enhance our chances for success. I wanted to optimize our chances for success by driving to the trailhead on Friday evening, but that was not the consensus. We would each be carrying heavy backpacks, which would be especially more difficult for Adam to do considering his small size (5' 7"", 110 lbs). Plus, Greg worked on Friday, so it was decided that Saturday would be our low-key, non-technical day. We planned to start hiking midday on Saturday, find a decent campsite area in Cispus Basin that afternoon, and then make a summit attempt on Sunday. That plan did not allow room for error in case of bad weather on Sunday, but we were fortunate to have a weather forecast that looked good. DAY ONE: Greetings And The March To CispusI picked up Gimpilator and Greg on Saturday morning, July 30. We drove over three hours to reach the Snowgrass Flats Hiker Trailhead #96A (~4650’ elevation). Adam was waiting at the trailhead for our arrival. This was my first time meeting Adam, and I quickly discovered he has a vast knowledge of peaks in general and county highpoints specifically. After our various introductions and gear sorting, we began hiking at 11:35 AM. The weather was very good and there was no snow along the lower section of the trail. We encountered occasional minor patches of snow prior to the bridge crossing Goat Creek, but nothing significant. After Goat Creek, the snow became more frequent. At one point, the snow covered over the trail so much that we lost the trail route altogether. Greg and I each had GPS devices that showed our intended direction straight ahead, although we later discovered during our descent that the trail system actually switchbacked along a hillside to the west of where we had lost the trail route. Greg and I had the team continue straight along snowy terrain towards where our GPS devices showed the trail reaching a creek crossing. It was during this part of our route that I began to realize just how much Adam hated trekking with snow. Considering Adam lived in southern California, I could understand why he might have some uncomfortability with hiking across snowy terrain. However, considering Adam had summited all but 11 county highpoints in the western United States, including some of the snowiest and most technical county highpoints, I was shocked to see him express such discomfort just hiking along snow, which was not at all steep terrain. He claimed this discomfort resulted from what he considered ""a perfect storm"" which he had never previously encountered all at once: a heavy backpack (which nearly equalled half his body weight), side-traversing along hilly terrain, and slushy snow. With that said, he was determined to continue and we maintained a good pace. At 1:35 PM we reached major creek crossing at the same location that the actual trail crossed it. Without a bridge present, we had to ford the creek using rock-hopping techniques. We each took several minutes to examine the various options. Greg, Gimpilator, and I were comfortable with one particular section to cross, while Adam found a section further upstream that he thought looked easier to cross. Fording A Creek Once on the other side of the creek, a wooden sign pointed our team in the correct direction, and although there was continuous snowpack to traverse, the route was relatively straightforward to follow. Within an hour, we reached a junction with the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) and decided to take a break there. Despite the snowpack, we could see and follow several bootprint tracks along the PCT. Where tracks were not present, we could still trace the PCT route fairly simply. The route soon began side-traversing along snowy slopes, which increased Adam's dissatisfaction with the terrain conditions. We eventually reached open talus slopes followed by meadow slopes, prior to reaching Cispus Basin. These slopes had more exposure to direct sunlight than the rest of our earlier route, and there were numerous sections already melted-out as a result. Small streams passed across the trail under multiple snowy sections, for which we used extra caution crossing. One decent-size waterfall crossing was required, but still nothing trivial. Side-Traverse On PCT Approaching Cispus Basin We finally reached our camp (~6150’ elevation) at Cispus Basin at 4:05 PM, exactly 7.5 miles and 4h30m from the trailhead. Shortly after reaching camp, I looked slightly northeast towards our next day’s goal of Big Horn. While looking up the basin I saw a lot of movement along the snow at the base of the rocky ridgeline near the peak. I quickly realized that the movement was a large herd of mountain goats trekking across the upper basin. In total, I counted nearly four dozen mountain goats, far exceeding any herd total I had ever previously seen. After watching the goats for a while, we spent the remaining daylight hours setting up our tents, resting, making dinner, and preparing our gear for the following day… our summit day. Cispus Basin Nearly Four Dozen Mountain Goats! Big Horn At Sunset DAY TWO: Great Team, Good Snow, Bad Rock, And Worthy SummitThe following morning, July 31, our team began leaving camp at 5:35 AM. We reached a mountain pass (~6900’ elevation) at 6:10 AM. The pass has no official name, although Greg dubbed it “Black Thumb Pass” due to its close proximity to a rock spire nicknamed “Black Thumb”. There was a lot of evidence of previous mountain goat activity at the pass, especially where they had rested and left tuffs of hair on the ground. Our group put on our helmets (although my helmet was already on when I had left camp) and crampons (except Gimpilator). Then we continued heading east over the pass. Summit Day Begins! ""Black Thumb Pass"" We passed by two steep snow gullies before reaching a gully located immediately prior to a stream gully. We ascended the steep snow slope for ~100’ before Adam found a rock rib to scramble for a while. Gimpilator did the same. Greg and I continued on the snow because it seemed safer, more straightforward, and less labor-intensive. Eventually, the rock rib ended at a large rock-snow moat, forcing Adam and Gimpilator to follow the snowy route being ascended by Greg and I. However, as soon as another rock rib was reached higher up, at ~7300’ elevation, Adam and Gimpilator once again left the snow in favor of a loose rocky scramble. We soon each crossed a short snow slope to a boulder rock outcrop (~7550’ elevation) at 7:30 AM, where we took a 15-minute break. From the boulder outcrop, we could see the rest of our summit approach route. After crossing a steep snow slope, we would reach a steep rock rib that we would scramble for most of the remaining ascent. The upper snow slope that we were about to side-traverse to the rock rib was the same area that Greg sustained a fall during his previous trip to Big Horn during 2007. He showed our team where he had fallen and described how it had happened. Fortunately, our team was able to cross the snowy slope and reach the rock rib safely at 7600’ elevation. Crossing The Last Steep Snow Slope... Adam and Gimpilator were both ecstatic at the prospect of leaving snow a final time for our ascent. After removing our crampons, we began steeply scrambling the rock rib. Due to several steep sections on the leftside and middle sections, we primarily scrambled on the rightside of the rock rib. There was no “wrong” route; we just kept trying to find the path of least resistance and that seemed to work well for us. We finally reached the “crux” section (~7960’ elevation) of our trip, a short but steep rock climb, at 8:45 AM. Greg, Gimpilator, and Adam Scrambling A Rock Rib... Redwic and Adam Scrambling Steep Rock... Scrambling High On Big Horn... Gimpilator Sees The ""Crux"" Section As mentioned earlier, the “crux” move of this section is considered by many people to be the most difficult crux move of any county highpoint in the contiguous United States. Famous local peakbagger Fred Beckey lists this crux move as YDS Class 4, but most people categorize it as being in the YDS Class 5.4-5.6 range. The “crux” section involves ascending a 10’-15’ crack, which would be the shortest rock climbing pitch that Gimpilator and I had ascended during our various trips during that month. Greg setup the rope and led this section, followed by Gimpilator, Adam, and finally me. This took some time, but we were trying to be as safe as possible. I tend to agree with the YDS Class 5.4 rating for this section; there was only one spot in the middle of the rockface that required extra time to ascend, but only slightly so. Once atop the “crux” section, the rest of the ascent was an easy ridge walk (~30’) to the summit (8000’ elevation), which we reached at 9:25 AM. Gimpilator Climbing The ""Crux"" Section Looking Up At The Summit Of Big Horn Reaching the top of Big Horn was quite an achievement for each of us. For Greg, it was his second successful summit of the peak. For Adam, it was his 35th Washington County Highpoint achieved and then only had 10 county highpoints in the western United States still to summit. For Gimpilator, it was his first summit attained in the Goat Rocks Wilderness Area, and he enjoyed the ascent so much that he immediately wanted to attempt more peaks in the region. For me, it was my 38th Washington County Highpoint achieved, leaving only Mount Baker (located in Whatcom County) to complete that peakbagging list. I did not think the summit approach, overall, was more difficult than Mount Olympus or Bonanza Peak. However, due to the steep snow slopes, loose rocky slopes, scrambling, and rock climbing involved, I could easily determine why Big Horn deserves its “Apex” status as one of the more difficult county highpoints to summit. Happy To Have One Less Summit To Climb After taking a break along the summit ridge, we rappeled down the “crux” section and then chose to rappel most of the rock rib rather than downclimb it. Doing so required more time but also seemed safer than downclimbing. The rappeling made us feel much more comfortable, although Gimpilator and I briefly considered steeply descending the snow slope located on the side of the rock rib. After reaching the bottom of the rock rib, we each crossed the steep snowy slopes back to the boulder outcrop at 12:15 PM. Greg Rappels The ""Crux"" Section Greg Leads The Second Rappel... Adam Begins The Second Rappel... Gimpilator Begins The Second Rappel... After taking a 15-minute break there, Greg, Gimpilator, and I began trekking towards Gilbert Peak while Adam decided to stay at the boulder outcrop and rest. We did not reach Gilbert Peak only due to time constraints that day, only getting as far as the upper slopes of Goat Citadel, and we returned to Adam at 2:15 PM. Adam did not like the prospect of descending steep snow slopes, so we sought a better descent option elsewhere. We found a rock rib located near the gully we had ascended. There were several cairns on the rock rib, which gave us confidence that we were on a viable route. The rock rib led our team down the other side of the stream gully that we had avoided on our ascent, forcing us to steeply descend to, and then cross, the stream. After traversing over one final short rock rib on the other side of the stream, we plunge-stepped and glissaded down the remaining 100’ to the basin below. Adam Descends A Loose Rocky Rib I reached “Black Thumb Pass” at 4:10 PM, with the rest of the team a short distance behind me, and then we reached camp at 4:35 PM. After taking a break, gathering water, and tearing-down our campsite, we headed back onto the PCT shortly after 6:00 PM. The descent to the trailhead was mostly uneventful except for reaching our vehicles at 9:40 PM in the dark. Greg, Gimpilator, and I said our “good-byes” to Adam before heading back home at 10:00 PM. Adam, on the other hand, decided to car-camp that evening before heading to Idaho to attempt more county highpoints on his “to do” list. I finally reached my home at 1:50 AM on Monday morning, very tired but very happy to be home safe after a successful trip for Big Horn. TRIP VIDEO SPECIAL THANKSSpecial thanks to Greg Slayden for making this trip possible. His prior knowledge of the route and terrain, combined with his rope-leading skills, really benefited our team. Thanks also to the two Adams, Mr. Helman and Mr. Walker, who were great mountaineering partners and who provided great conversations throughout the trip.

single-day,Rainier in a Day: A Challenging Escapade,"Introduction ""Do not wish for easier lives, wish to be stronger men"" -John F. Kennedy ""I am not an adventurer by choice but by fate."" -Vincent van Gogh This was quite the undertaking. The previous year I climbed Mount Rainier in two days which was a little bit tiring, but not a big deal. This time it was both physically and mentally challenging due to the high altitude. We would be heading up from Sea level to 14,411 feet in about 14 hours which I had never done anything like this. Though out the summer I had been climbing so many mountains that you get to a point where nothing is hard anymore, you find yourself wanting a new challenge, something completely new. On this trip I got more than what I bargained for. My buddy Eastking introduced me to his friend Jordan who turned out to be a nice guy. Jordan called me up asking if I wanted to climb Rainier, his work had his free time limited which I purposed the idea of doing it in a single day. My brother Michael decided to join on this trip making us a solid 3 man rope team. The weather at first was looking quite questionable, but every time I've been on Rainier I was above the clouds. This was perhaps the hardest climb I did all year. A Day AttemptI started off my adventure hiding multiple buses to get to Jordan's house in Seattle. From his house we took off towards Paradise for our Rainier climb. Although it was misty, I was pleased that it was not raining on us when we first stepped out. The snow had been long since gone in comparison to my previous attempt. On our way to Camp Muir I saw some Lupine Flowers, Marmots, and some nice clearings though the clouds. As we near Camp Muir we get above the clouds just in time to see the alpenglow of sunset. It was quite rewarding just getting to Camp Muir. Lupine Flowers Lush Green Forest Marmot on the Rocks Skyline High Point Hiking into the Mist Marmot Upclose Hiking up the Muir Snowfield An Opening in the Sky Walking into Wonderland At camp Muir we decided to take a rest and have dinner before we got up into the higher altitude. My brother noticed that he was running low on head lamp power which he was forced to ask the ranger for extras. The ranger then told us all about the mountain conditions and was nice to us. After getting tried in we were ready to cross the Cowlitz Glacier. Sunset Colors from Camp Muir My brother and I Muir Peak during Sunset Alpenglow from the Cowlitz Hiking Above the Clouds Crossing the Cowlitz was easy as expected, the altitude was not effecting me so far. The Cathedral Rocks were a bit of a hassle because the rope would get caught in the rocks making us have to slow down and whip the rope out of them. As we got near Ingraham Flats Michael was starting to feel the altitude which I kept in mind but did not think much of it. As we got higher breaks became more frequent, but still at a decent pace. When ever I went to get a drink of water I would have ice chunks making it less desirable to get a drink. But I forced myself to because I knew it was necessary. As we got onto the Cleaver I started feeling sleepy. I've always heard about warnings against headaches, dizziness, and other sick feelings when at high altitude. But rarely do I hear about people complaining about getting ridiculously sleepy. I was feeling strong in my legs and in the lungs, but the altitude was starting to get to me. There is a point where we should have turned around sooner, but the ambition and that strive for pushing a challenge compelled us to continue. It wasn't about making the summit. Both Jordan and I have already summited before. Michael's physical condition was deteriorating quite rapidly and I silently nodded knowing that we wouldn't make it. Jordan wanted to see at least how far we could make it. This was now beginning to be a challenge because you just become so tired that you look at a pile of rocks and think to yourself ""That would be so nice if I could just for sec lay down and sleep"" but I knew how dangerous that would be. You tell yourself things like ""Get a hold of yourself, we got a climb to do"". After pressing on for what seemed like hours we were near the top of the Disappointment Cleaver. Michael finally announced that he cannot press on anymore in the condition that he was in. So we finally decided to call it quits and save this for another time. Descending DownGoing down was a bit frightening. I was so sleepy that if we even as much as stood there for a few seconds idol, I would instantly fall asleep. The scariest moments are when you wake up to plunging in your ice axe and feeling like you could have slipped just then down the steep icy slope below. Staying awake was not easy to do when the altitude is effecting you more than you had anticipated. I would end up having to do everything I could to maintain a focus on what I was doing. When we got down lower it was a big releaf. After crossing the Cowlitz Glacier we rested for a while and watched the sunrise. Sunrise on Camp Muir Gibraltar Rock during Sunrise Sunrise on Mount Hood Sunrise on the Tatoosh Heading Back Down Sunrise on Eagle Peak Morning Sunrise to the South Morning Ridges Above Clouds Sunrise on Mount Adams Southwest Views from Rainier The weather now was nearly perfect. The snow was a bit icy on the way down but manageable. After an hour or so we were back to the car. This was quite a tiring trip. But my Rainier goal was not complete yet, a few weeks later I returned. Rainier in a DayFrom my previous day attempt I knew this would be a challenging climb. This time my brother did not come in knowing that it would be too much for him. For the approach Jordan invited a friend who had little mountaineering experience. I was fortunate enough to get a hide from Jordan this time which meant no hours of busing and waiting which was nice. Like the other times, the weather was not looking so good, it was raining on the ride in which I was starting to estimate that we had between a 10-33% chance of making it. ""What food will I need for the trip?"" asked our driver. Jordan replied ""Oh just a subway sandwich"" which I laughed at this comment. ""What would say say for a winter ascent of Rainier?"" I asked. ""Perhaps a second subway sandwich"". Paintbrush Flower Wet Blue Flowers Grouse on Rainier Danger Zone Sign When starting out on the trail my boots felt quite tight making my feet have a pulsing feeling. This worried me, but fortunately this went away after a while of hiking. This was once again the usual hike up through Panorama Point, Pebble Creek and up the Muir Snow field in the fog. Near Camp Muir the fog started to clear up some revealing Rainier although some of it still lingering and rising. This time we made it to Camp Muir at about 3:20 p.m. which we rested for about an hour and started the crossing of the Cowlitz Glacier. Hiking through the Fog Mount Rainier Clearing Up A Hungry Camp Bird Hiking Towards Cathedral Rock Scrambling the rocks during the day is much easier considering that you don't go off route. During the night some of the rock looks similar to the trail making it sometimes slower going. When we got above Cathedral Rock we were officially above the clouds. I suddenly became a lot more optimistic about us making it. Jordan Hiking the Pathway to Ingraham Flats We were making great time, from Camp Muir to Cathedral Gap in about 20 minutes. But just as the weather was getting nicer above, as we cross over to Ingraham Flats the winds start picking up. At this time of year the Ingraham Glacier is quite broken up requiring us to go up a little bit of the Direct Route and then back down in order to get to the Cleaver. There are a few minor crevasse jumpings along the way. Before crossing onto the Cleaver there was perilous section that went over a snow bridge. There was no margin for error here, one one side you have a 50 foot drop below you, if you step in the wrong spot on the bridge it might collapse, and to your right is a very large cliff making this section the second most dangerous part of the climb. Also this spot has rock falling hazard as well. Little Tahoma in Clouds Snow Bridge to the Flats Ingraham Direct Looking into a Crevasse Climbing into Dangerous Terrain The winds returned making the puffy jackets very nice to have. The sun had long since passed beyond the mountain making the air much cooler and giving the landscape an evening like feel. We had to make the best of our day light situation which is why we rushed up the Cleaver. Once we got above the Cleaver we were back on the glacier which was heavily broken up. We ended up having to curve far over to the right to avoid an impassible crevasse field which for the most part there was a pathway. But every now and then we would come across a section that you would ask yourself ""Is this the way?"". Penitentes Above the DC A Break in the Clouds Upper Ingraham Glacier Lenticular Forming on Adams Looking Down the Cleaver Myself Crossing a Crevasse The Pathway during Sunset Darkness came over the mountain, it was time to turn on the headlamps. There were now numerous crevasses that we passed by and step overs that we had to be careful. One of the latters to avoid a crevasse section was out of commission due to the glacier being to broken up. A moment later we came across what I consider the most dangerous part of the route. Most people who climb Rainier won't have to deal with this part as long as they don't climb in late season. The pathway suddenly seemed to have vanished, Jordan and I had to descend in a bowl like section. As Jordan took a few more steps I could head crackling noises and what sounded like we were going to break though! I instantly was in a bit of a panic wondering what would happen next. We spotted a set up rope that crossed over a very precarious crevassed section. It certainly would not be ideal to travel in the same way that the rope was set up. After hearing more crackles and seeing the icicles and the over hang behind us I realized we were on a ice shelf. Fortunately it was so compact and icy that it remained solid. If I recall correctly there was a jump that we had to be very careful about and make a big leap. After the Ice Shelf section and a few mini crevasse crossings things became a lot safer. But at the same time we were gaining altitude. I was becoming very thirsty from the climb, every time I got a drink it was less and less desirable with the fact that the lid and the water was freezing over. It got to the point where I couldn't get the lid off until I banged it on a rock, then I had to use my ice axe to chip out enough ice to get a few sips of water. Looking to the East we could see the moon rising in a bright glorious red color, Jordan asked me ""Wow! Is that the sun?"" which I found humorous because it resembled it quite a bit. Getting up to 14,000 feet was fairly easy with little obstacles. I managed to find a spot that was out of the winds to capture a 60 second shutter speed shot of the view to the East. But the down side was that it made my hands very cold. The Views to the East from 14,000 feet during Night Time I once once again feeling quite sleepy, but unlike last time I felt as though I had a bit more energy in me and by this point we were almost there. Before getting to the crater rim there was a latter that goes over a big crevasse. What made it feel a little worry some was the fact that as you got on the ladder, it slid as you climbed across it. I held onto the provided rope just in case the ladder slid too far and fell in. After the ladder crossing it was a walk to the crater rim. At the crater rim many people unrope here, but we were so tired and the fact that the winds were blowing hard made the idea unappealing. As we crossed the crater rim I started realizing why it might have been a good idea because the rope was constantly catching on Penitentes (ice spikes) making travel a bit more difficult. But soon we were out of the snow and onto the final rock section. I was feeling the altitude more than ever, but with us being 200 feet from the summit we slowly scrambled/hiked to the summit at about 11:20 a.m. I was excited to have completed this challenge. The Summit Crater during Night Time Going Back DownWe stayed on the summit for about 2 minutes because the winds were blowing quite hard making us feel quite cold. The night sky was so beautiful, like being on top of the world. We could see distant city lights while at the same time being above the clouds with the moon shining brightly above. Every 1,000 feet of altitude we lost I felt much better and became less sleepy. My headlamp was semi low on power which for much of the way down I turned it off to save power. The moon light was so bright with the reflecting snow that I could see quite fine. The only real worry some parts on the way down were coming back through the ice shelf and getting off the Disappointment Cleaver. It was kinda funny running into the guides and such at 2 a.m. and telling them that we summited hours ago. The way down was pleasant in the sense that the winds stopped and it seemed warmer than before. After passing through Ingraham camp for some reason we got a little lost looking for the pathway. We had to walk over more mini crevasses looking for the right way until I finally decided it would be best to go towards the ridge of Cathedral Rock which eventually brought us to a boot path. I considered taking off my crampons for the rest of the trip, but kept them on for the Cowlitz Glacier. This turned out to be a bad idea on my end. I was so tired that I kept tripping over my own crampons. I became heavily sleepy and was in a state of stumbling, partly because my ankles were giving way. ""Hold yourself together, maintain focus"" I whispered to myself. A second later I instantly lost focus and nearly fell on my face. This was one of the more miserable moments on the mountain were you start thinking to yourself ""I need to take a break from mountaineering for a little while"". Or at least those are your thoughts on the mountain when your exhausted. Part way across the Cowlitz Glacier I finally decided to take off my crampons because it was too painful to keep stumbling and nearly twisting my ankle on each step. Seeing Camp Muir ahead was such a teaser because I knew our pace was slowing down to a dreadful pace. A while later we arrive at Camp Muir at about 3:52 a.m. and finally take a rest. I'll admit I was not soar, but was mostly sleepy. We decided it would be best to rest for a few hours before going back down. Just getting into my bunk was challenging because every time I did anything, it made quite a bit of noise which people were trying to sleep. I had to make very slow movements but eventually had myself situated. Then I instantly fell sleep. Waking up 2 and a half hours later we decide to finally to pack our gear and head on down. The Muir snow field was a bit icy. I did not feel like wearing crampons again, so what I did was I used the textured snow field where it dips in to help me slow down as I went down hill in fast motion. After getting out of the snow I ran much of the way down in order to get to the parking lot in time to get an official less than 24 hour ascent and descent. On the way I saw some beautiful flowers and marmots. I made it down with time to spare. Blue Ridges though the Clouds Mountain to the West Waterfalls above the Nisqually Lupine Flower with Droplets Preserve Fragile Meadows Yellow Field of Flowers Marmot Down Climbing A Field of Lupines Mist over the Tatoosh Peaks Lupines with the Trail Toosh Ranger with Flowers Lane Peak with a Flag Hiking Back into the Clouds I was disappointed that I had no victory treat because my crampons had punctured a hole in the soda can that I was looking forward to. This happened earlier on in the trip. On the way back home I once again had to take multiple buses. When I got home I could finally get some well deserved rest. Doing this mountain in a single day makes all the difference in the world in the difficulty.

multi-day,Olympus: 4th Of July Route On The 5th Of July,"When I was attending WWU I found a book in the Library called Glorious Failures. In this anthology I read the historical account about the race to be the first to climb Mount Olympus. This challenge was highly publicized in the Seattle area and it took something like 9 months for the would-be climbers to hack their way 18 miles through dense forest and brush to the Blue Glacier. Anyone who has hiked the Hoh River trail can imagine how difficult it must have been on that first trek. Unfortunately, that first summit party made it to the top in a white-out. They returned to Seattle as adventurous heroes, but later it was proven they had climbed the east summit by mistake. Olympus has several summit spires, the west being the highest. Weeks later, another party followed the path which was created and made a successful summit climb in 1907. Olympus Seen From Mount Angeles, August 2007 For most peakbaggers, 44 miles combined with glacier travel and rock climbing in the rainiest part of one of the rainiest states in the country sounds like a daunting challenge. At least it did to me. Furthermore, one of the leading causes of failure on Olympus these days is blisters. But the goal was a worthy one. At 7,969 feet, Olympus is the highest in the Olympic Range and the highest point on the peninsula. If I was successful on this trip, I would be fulfilling a 5-year dream and it would also be my second Mount Olympus. Olympus Seen From Gray Wolf, November 2009 Fortunately, in our team of three, each person had special skills to offer to the group. ""Redwic"" Craig is a gifted planner/organizer and expert navigator; Dave has many years of rock climbing experience, and I've led a lot of rope teams across various glaciers. As trip organizer, Craig insisted that we each reserve a week off of work so that we could optimize our chances of getting a ""weather window"". This irritated my boss (and me), but it later proved to be essential for our success. Mount Tom and ""Janus"" Seen During The Approach We began our approach on July 3rd. The first few miles of the trail were choked with tourists. I couldn't understand what the draw was for this trail because I know hundreds of trails in the Cascades that are far more scenic. We were glad to get deeper into the woods where the real hikers were, people who practice proper trail etiquette. Overall, the first day was uneventful. We hiked the first 10.7 miles to Lewis Meadows, setting up camp right next to the Hoh River. I was very pleased to be missing the loud explosions in the middle of the night on the days preceding our country's Independence Day. Out there in the wilderness I slept like a baby. The Trail, Destroyed By Avalanche As we suspected, the second day was harder. Each of our packs was over 50 pounds and we had to gain 3,000 feet in 6.9 miles to reach Glacier Meadows, our staging area for summit day. As we had heard over the last few years, this section of the trail was thrashed. Many avalanches have totally wiped out the trail. One chute was over 100 meters across. In the preceding year, the park system had set up a rope ladder on the steep side of the chute, but this year we found only a hand line. Blue Glacier Ice Falls Upon arrival in Glacier Meadows, the snow was in rapid melt-off with runoff streams everywhere. That made collecting water much easier. We had carried a snow shovel to make a flat platform for our tent, but since nobody was staying at Glacier Meadows, we pitched out tent right on the front porch of the Ranger's yurt. It nearly covered the entire porch. After setting up camp, we went to a nearby snow slope. I wanted to make sure that the z-pulley procedure for crevasse rescue was fresh in everyone's mind, including myself. Ascending Snow Dome Mount Mercury We set our alarm for 4am, hoping to get moving by 5. The next morning we tried to avoid the cold with some of Dave's instant coffee. It was great stuff but it triggered some necessary delays and we didn't get moving until 5:30. We made an ascending traverse to an avalanche chute where we turned straight uphill. Then we pushed through some trees to a point where we could see the glacial moraine. I was excited at this point because I knew that from the top of that moraine, I would have my first up close view of the Blue Glacier and Olympus. It was an amazing sight! But we could not see the west summit, as it was hidden by the formation known as Snow Dome. From the top of the moraine it was difficult to find a good place to descend to the glacier. One ranger had warned us that for many people, this is the hardest part of the route. The rocky slope is very steep and every part of it which is disturbed, gives way and falls downhill. Footing on that slope was tricky and good handholds were nonexistent. The Summit Ridge Fourth Of July Route When we reached the glacier, we ditched our trekking poles and donned our harnesses. After double-checking each other's prussik loops, rope knots, personal anchors and waist straps, we set off across the Blue Glacier. We passed over a number of trivial crevasses, most of which were only just starting to open up for the season. Many were only visible as small cracks about an inch wide. On our left, Mount Mathias and Mount Mercury towered thousands of feet overhead. In front of us we could see part of the East Summit. To our right was our next objective, Snow Dome. Ascending Snow Dome allows access to the upper glacier, bypassing the dangerous icefalls and serac mayhem. Near the top of Snow Dome, the views to the north and east really started opening up. The views of the Bailey Range were exceptional and Mount Mercury made a dramatic backdrop for some photos. Redwic Crossing The Bergschrund We turned southwest and headed straight for the west summit spire which was now in view, standing high above the glacier. We were following the tracks of a 3 person team that had summited two days prior. They were the first successful team this year. We hoped to be the second. They had taken the ""4th of July"" route which is the most direct route. This route is rarely climbed in the summer, due to the fact that it has several gigantic bergschrunds that open up fairly early in the season. We could not tell from our vantage point what condition they were in. The standard route traverses around a grouping known as ""The 5 Fingers"" and then goes over the false summit. Going that way would add at least an hour each way. Nearing The Summit Block We made our way up the steep snow slope passing by the end of several of the schrunds. We crossed one snow bridge and the view down inside the chasm to my left was disheartening. Near the saddle between the west summit and false summit we came to the last bergschrund, which the previous party had warned us about. They said, ""It's kind of like a big step, but it depends on what you're comfortable with"". It looked as if it had melted out even more since they had been here. I could see a spot where it was filled in with snow, but I knew better than to trust what looked like solid ground. If the filler snow was soft, there might be nothing underneath but empty space. On the other hand, without this spot as a crossing, there was no way to proceed with our chosen route. Summit Block, East Face I asked Dave and Craig to straighten out the rope and take all the slack out of it. I told them to be prepared to arrest if I should fall in. I probed the snow and then took a step of faith. It held. The upper lip of the bergschrund was about 8 feet high and part of it was overhanging. I had never tried to climb overhanging snow before, but I found that if I placed my axe in at an angle, as high on the lip as possible, I could create enough leverage to pull myself up, using the front points of my crampons to kick into the overhang. After some struggling, this technique worked and I was on the other side. Dave's turn was next and then Craig. We were very cautious as each person crossed, already partially in arrest position should anything happen. Redwic Crossing The Moat At the saddle, Dave assessed the summit rocks. The standard route climbs the east side, which is covered with loose, crumbly rock. Dave said he thought the north ridge looked more solid and Craig confirmed that this is what his research had suggested. We climbed a short 60-degree snow slope up to the base of the north ridge. At Dave's suggestion, I made a belay station in the snow using two axes for anchors. I had led on the glacier, but this was Dave's area of expertise and now it was important to follow his directions. The problem here was that a nasty moat had began melting away from the base of the rocks. Down inside was an unwelcoming fall into ice on all sides. Dave said he thought we would have to do the rotten east side after all, but I encouraged him to try to get across the moat. After struggling for awhile, he made his way across a very thin snow bridge that didn't look like it should hold any weight at all. Once he placed the first cam I breathed a sigh of relief. He was now in his element. As he climbed, he placed several more cams and finally a nut. Near the top, what appeared from below to be the easiest part, in fact turned out to be more difficult. He was not able to protect that portion of the climb. On Top Of The North Ridge When he reached the crest of the ridge, he set up a belay station and I followed his route, cleaning as I went. When I was up, Craig followed. Apparently the thin snow bridge had had enough of our nonsense because it collapsed under Craig just as he reached the far side. Craig made quick work of the rock and even dodged a falling rock that was triggered by the rope. When we were all on top of the north ridge, we scrambled up to the summit. Not a cloud in the sky! What an awesome day. We could see the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Pacific Ocean. We could see Mount Baker, Mount Rainier, and Mount Saint Helens, and all round us were Olympic peaks. We spent 15 minutes on the summit. Back at the belay station we took turns rappelling. I went first. It was kind of a trick to get across the moat now that the snow bridge was destroyed, but we managed. The Summit After roping up, we retraced our route past the bergschrunds, upper Blue, Snow Dome, lower Blue, moraine, and avalanche chute back to camp. We packed up as quickly as possible hoping to make some progress before sunset. We made it as far as the High Hoh Bridge, which left only 13.5 miles for the following day. It was a wonderful evening, camping in solitude with two friends in the wilderness after a successful day of climbing. I must say that achieving a tough goal somehow makes dehydrated food taste gourmet. By the time I finished brushing my teeth and got in the tent, Craig and Dave were both fast asleep. 360° View From The Summit Full Size (click again on next page) The next day we passed the Olympus Guard Station, 9.2 miles from the trail head, and informed them that Olympus now had two successful ascents for 2011. We told them that we had climbed the ""4th of July"" route on the 5th of July. Furthermore, because of worsening bergschrunds and moats, we explained that the route would be impassable by now. One Ranger shook his head as if we had taken an unnecessary risk. The other rangers looked impressed. They asked us not to tell any other climbers about it if we ran into them on the trail, so that no one would be tempted to follow in our footsteps.

I bet you are glad that I insisted on taking the entire week off from work. We actually did the trip sooner than originally anticipated. We originally were thinking about making an attempt later during that week, which we discovered after our trip had horrible weather and conditions. Many potential summit teams fail because they do not allow enough ""wiggle room"" time-wise just in case of bad weather. Besides, you still got to help out your boss later in the week, anyway. ;-) Side-Note: Yes, the rangers did not want us to tell other potential summiters that we used the ""Fourth of July"" route. However, I had the opposite theory. I made certain to tell several other potential summiters that we passed, as well as rangers, to *not* follow the footsteps on the mountain. If I had not done that, then other teams likely would have followed the footsteps thinking that was the best route. With only two successful summit teams (ours and the one two days prior), I did not want other people to follow the same route with worsening conditions and fail (or get into unseen risks). Telling others that advice seemed to be the right thing to do. gimpilator - Aug 3, 2011 12:24 am - Hasn't voted Re: Great TR... It sure was a great trip. I'm glad we could do it together.

single-day,Old Goats Scramble North Twin Sister,"North Twin Sister West Ridge Trip Report: North Twin Sister; west ridge on the right skyline On impulse I looked down and there before me on bended knee were 200 ravishing, gorgeous females! No sorry, that’s wrong. I meant ravenous and gorging. The bent knees were mine and the females were of the blood-sucking gender of the genus Anopheles clustered thickly on each kneecap where the fabric of my pants was stretched tightest and thinnest thus enabling the easiest route to their supper. But, hey, at my age, you take female attention where you can get it right? This all took place at a camp that Don (74), Tony (65) and I, Martin (the baby at 60) had placed at the top of the highest road giving access to the west ridge of North Twin Sister, our objective for the following morning. We had left Victoria, BC on the 9 am ferry earlier that day, had endured the now normal but fortunately brief encounter with US border paranoia and arrived at the gated bridge over the Nooksack Middle Fork at exactly 1.10 pm. Judging by the number and type of vehicles parked there, there were obviously quite a few people making the more usual bike-approach day-trip out of the climb than planning an overnighter. None of us creakier types much fancied pushing heavy bikes up 850 vertical metres of logging road, so we had opted to haul even heavier packs up there instead. I’m still not sure if this was the right decision and it’s too late now anyway. For the most part the roads are in very good shape and all you have to do is put your head down, your brain in neutral and grunt away steadily for 4 hours or so. The only distraction of note that I can remember was fording the Galbraith River at 3.30 and at an elevation of 880 metres. The approach directions Tony had printed out from Matt Gunn’s “Scrambles in Southwest British Columbia” (I love the way Matt has annexed Washington) were impeccable and without putting a foot wrong, 5.30 pm saw us at the bottom of the trail that leads through recent new growth, nice open old growth and finally onto the west ridge itself. The afternoon had been clear and hot and after pitching camp all we really wanted to do was drink, drink and drink some more. Having re-hydrated we finally did feel more like supper and eventually got round to fueling up for the next day’s effort. Mosquito heaven below North Twin If anyone is planning on camping at this spot note that unless there’s snow on the ground the nearest water is 5 minutes back down the road you came up on at the last switchback that turns right. Fill up here before carrying on to camp where we did. Or, for the sake of 5 minutes, put your tent up right by the road. There’s no-one coming this way but folk mountain biking down the road and they’re all long gone by 6 pm or so. By 8 pm we’d eaten, cleared away, organised packs for the morning, fed the dense clouds of mosquitoes many times over and were pretty well driven into the blessed relief of the tents by 8.30. The night was warm and I didn’t even get into my sleeping bag until the early hours of the following morning. As usual before a climb, I slept fitfully and was already up when my alarm went off at 5 am the next day. After the usual morning ablutions and oblations to the local mountain gods – and giving the mozzies their breakfast of course - we were off up the trail in smart order at 6.10 am.   Base of the west ridge  Lower west ridge. It takes only about 45 minutes of easy walking before the ridge narrows, the first easy scrambling starts and its time to put the pole away and the helmet on. The route goes very gently at first at barely Class 2 but then Class 3 passages begin to present themselves more frequently and of longer duration. By the time the “obelisk” was reached at about 8 am, the ridge is solid Class 3 climbing and you’re beginning to wonder if that last 20 metres or so wouldn’t have been more accurately described as easy 4th. Eschewing MountaingirlBC’s and others’ heroics on the obelisk as the domain of those who have not yet discovered the meaning of mortality, we down-climbed a little to the right and made progress up towards the false summit mostly on this side of the ridge crest.  West ridge above the obelisk A few false leads followed to be sure but, as all the books say, the olivine rock makes you feel like Spiderman and a huge hold presents itself almost every time you need one. I can only remember once stepping up to find I had to use a crimper for my next handhold rather than a huge velcro jug. Not bad at all in 800 metres of vertical gain. Once the base of the false summit was reached we down-climbed a bit to the right – following Becky’s route now rather than Gunn’s - until we could see the “comb” above us on the skyline. This a distinctive set of rooster’s comb-like pinnacles on the ridgeline approximately midway between the false and main summits. We then traversed to the right to a chossy gully directly below an obvious notch in the ridge to climber’s right of the comb. Rather than the gully we went up Class 4 slabs and blocky faces to its left and arrived in the target notch little more ten minutes later. Upper west ridge approaching the notch From the notch we squeezed through a narrow cleft that gave easy access to the ridge once again, walked across a flat snowfield and then up to a small sub-summit from which the main summit was in full view.  The snow saddle just below the summit. From this point it was only a matter of walking down a gentle snow slope to the narrow snow saddle above the north face and a further minute of easy Class 3 to the top of North Twin. We summited at 10.55 precisely. Approaching the summit of North Twin Now began the summit photo ritual. The only problem is that there’s barely room for 3 people up there and stepping back sufficiently to get subject plus Baker or South Twin in shot results in becoming gravitationally challenged in short order, followed quite soon thereafter by death. So we made do with close ups of two days of stubble and maybe-that’s-Baker-peeping-over-his-shoulder stuff before returning to the snow saddle at the top of the north face for real photos and lunch. South Twin from the summit of North Twin Mt Baker from the summit of North Twin It’s hard to wax eloquent enough about the views, at least on the day we climbed North Twin. Perhaps it was a little too hot to deliver the right clarity for that perfect photo but who cares. It felt like you could almost reach out and touch Baker and in spite of the haze, we could still see as far as Rainier. Contemplating the descent. Downclimbing the north face The north face is steep. We set off down it at 10 minute intervals at about 11.30. Tony first, then Don, and then me. We all faced in for at least the first 150 vertical metres. Judging by the angle of my axe relative to the snow, I would estimate the slope to be at least 60° and maybe even more right where you drop off the saddle. Take this bit seriously! Don’t start to glissade too soon – or at all. I did and, to my shame, lost control. All ended well but let me just say thanks to “Dave” in the group that followed us down and retrieved the bits that fell off! Traversing back under the NW face Once the initial steep bit was behind us the return to camp became a pleasant walk traversing under the NW face to intersect the west ridge just before the point where we had put the poles away that morning. We arrived back at the tents at 2.15, a quick brew, pack up (why is one’s pack always heavier and fuller on the way out?) and we were heading down about 3.15. Just over two and a half hours of I-don’t-think-my-knees-were-made-to-do-this later and the Nooksack hove once more into view. The long road home. Thanks to my patented (and highly secret) border approach methodology, we negotiated a more than half-mile long traffic queue at Customs in just under 15 minutes and made the 9 pm sailing with ease. We got our $17 worth out of BC Ferries “Pacific Buffet” that night I can tell you. A few notes about gear. We carried a rope and some rock pro but never got anything out of the packs. We also schlepped crampons and a couple of pickets up to our camp but, based on the reports of people coming down and the temperatures during the night, left all that at the tents. Axes, however, were essential to downclimb the north face. Work gloves for the west ridge save cuts and scrapes on the super abrasive rock and make the climb that much more pleasant. Many thanks to Don and Tony. Great companions both and a privilege to share this experience with. Thanks a million guys!

single-day,Going for the Gold,"After having a few mountaineering attempts that week I decided it was time to stay low in the mountains, with a clear day I figured Gold Mountain would be a good choice. Fortunately I was right on this call, although sadly we did not make the summit. I took the bus to Arlington which Chris then drove us to Darrington which is right next to Gold Mountain. The road started off with semi deep snow (certainly too much for my mom's car). As we got higher up on the road the snow got deeper which at times we started loosing speed. Chris was persistent with wanting to get as far up the road as possible. Pretty soon there was a tree in the road which I figured would be the end of the line. Nope, sure enough Chris pulls out his chain saw and has me depressurize the tires so that going through the snow is better. Prairie Mountain from the Road Fallen Over Tree Prairie Mountain Panorama After this we came across more trees which Chris sawed away, on the last fallen over tree the chain saw nearly ran out of gas but we got lucky and got though. Later on we got caught in some deep snow which Chris once again was persistent to drive up, so he would back up and ram in 6 or so inches, go back and ram the snow again. The only other person I could think of with that much persistence with driving up is my dad. Eventually we managed to make it though. I can guarantee that most people's car's would not have made it. Eventually when snow got to around 2.5-3 feet deep we finally had to start the walking. Illbiot Peaks Looking Towards Darrington After all the previous trips breaking trail was tiresome for even a flat road. All the fresh snow made all the difference in the world with difficulty. After a ways we decided to skip a few switch backs which had a few tough spots because we had to take off our snowshoes. Soon it was back to the road again. I'll admit after a while of trail breaking part of me wanted to not push on so hard, but I knew if I didn't there would be no way we would summit. When ever Chris would lead walking behind his steps was like resting, sometimes what I would do is have him break trail for a few minutes and then I would be able to for a while. Trees on Prairie Mountain Mount Baker Animal Tracks The atmosphere of the place never got above freezing and we rarely saw the sun. For most of the day we had little views due to tree cover and such. But after passing around a corner we were finally rewarded, which made the whole things certainly worth while. Sloan Peak's North West Face A Big Cliff in the Mountain Loop Highway White Chuck Mountain with Clouds Shadows over Mount Pugh Mount Shuksan and Sauk Panorama Jumbo Mountain Mount Pugh Clearing Up Alpenglow on Illbiot Peaks Alpenglow on Prairie Mountain Alpenglow on White Chuck Mountain A Nice Evening After taking tons of photos it was 4:24 p.m. which we had to get down. We came very close to the height of the summit. On the way down we had some nice conversations, the sunset was quite nice which White Chuck Mountain which had been buried by clouds most of the day made a good appearance. Travel back down to the car was much easier. Chris drove me to Smokey Point which was out of his way, but was much appreciated. From here I took a few buses down to Lynnwood. It was another great and beautiful day to be out in the mountains.

multi-day,Fathers Day on Mt Adams,"Hey Dad, Happy Fathers DayAt the summit of Mt Adams a slender hand comes out of its mitten and I hear “Happy Fathers day, Dad!” It is my 16 year old son, Tanner, who likes winter mountaineering as much as I do. He is on his High School snowboard team, so where there is snow, that’s where he is likely to be. Dad, I am so excited, lets go! So the snowboard is coming, right? Ten extra pounds on his pack and of course, he is willing to endure that. You don’t know how many times we got bonked on the head by his snowboard on the way up. It did make a fine cook table at the Lunch Counter. Our crew includes two other dads, two of my dearest friends. Day One Trailhead for the #183 South SpurThe day started off at the Cold Springs campground, where our first glimpse of fun was a very neat little grey fox scavenging around a campsite. We snapped a couple shots of him and we hit the #183 trailhead, then we were on our way. Chewin up the #183 We slogged up to the Lunch Counter (Suksdorf Ridge) where we busted out our tents and make camp. Before we got the water boiling, we noticed a goat across the snowfield on some rock. A mountain goat on Adams? Local Resident I thought goats didn’t like crowds. After Tanner ate 1.5 mountain house meals, we went to explore. My buddy Matt got within about 40 feet of this guy and we got some great pictures. A great way to end day one with the sun going down over the LC, just an amazing place to be. Sun setting at the Lunch Counter (Suksdorf Ridge) Day TwoSure is a lot of snoring going on at 7:00 am. Its Fathers day—where’s my breakfast in bed? Oh right, I am in a tent @9200 ft and only one of my children is with me and he is not getting up to make me breakfast. So I made him Backpacker Pantry Biscuits and Gravy. Time to get everybody up and get ready for our summit push. We got no sleep on Friday, so we all agreed the night before to sleep in a little. At 8:00am we push off for Piker’s Peak. 30 degree snow climb? Huh. I didn’t take the time to measure, but it was steeper than 30 deg. Cowsface on day one on the South Spur It is not dangerous, but steep. We got up to Piker’s, took a long rest and started the trek to the summit. 400 feet below the summit of Mt Adams On the summit somebody left the freezer door open as the winds kicked up and the temperature dropped way down. We put our glissade pants on here (I don’t know why we didn’t wait until Piker’s) and trekked back to Piker’s Peak where my son picked up his cached snowboard, then everyone took off for the 2200ft fun time. I haven’t glissaded in years and am real rusty, not to mention I would be a like a freight train out of control and might hurt someone if I got too much speed going. Very happy group of summiteers, ""splattski"" style summit photo So I invented a new technique. I call it Gliss-SLEDING. That’s where you plow down the mountain much like a glissade but end up with a 300lb snow ball between your knees and your butt crack. Refreshing! Hey, what are those fast moving clouds and wind coming from? Hurry, pack up camp and our packs and let’s get out of here. Packed up in 30 minutes and we started glissading on our fannies, feet, plunge stepping, and sprinting for the Cold Springs Campground. It took us 50 minutes with a couple of five-minute breaks. We arrived just in time for the ice, hail and snow to start beating us in the face and vroom—we were outta there. Did I mention I forgot to call my wife this day? I had cell service for most of it and just couldn’t find the right time. So back home, she was planning funerals, but wanted me alive so she could kill me again (for dying or not calling). Despite the population on Mt Adams and the 400 mile approach from Boise Idaho, this was one of the greatest experiences I have had in many years. I have no regrets (well—besides not calling my wife or having her on the mountain with me). I was with my two dearest friends and my oldest son who was able to greet me with a “Happy Fathers Day” on the summit of Mt Adams. Rock On!

multi-day,The Picket Range Expedition,"The PicketsI slowly pulled myself forward though the thick brush with twigs still caught in between my 65-pound pack and my body. I struggled to free myself and press uphill. It was two steps up the hill and one step back because of the muddy ground sliding beneath my feet. Every branch that I fought through was wet and the rain made it that much more miserable. It is one thing to be hit in the face with a branch but it is quite another when its soaking wet. It was as if I was being slapped with a wet sock, over and over again. I was climbing up the approach to the Eliey Wiley ridge on day 2 of my 8-day expedition into the Picket range. It was a rude awakening when I realized what this mountain range actually included. The trip had not been presented to me as a bushwhack through the rainforest while being rained on and then endless climbing on loose boulder fields. I felt like I was trying to climb 50,000 bowling balls stack up on top of each other. But it didn’t matter; we were already 17 miles and a boat ride away from civilization. I had no choice but to press on. The BushwackWe started out on the first day of the trip with a boat ride 6 miles down Ross Lake to Big Beaver pass where we said goodbye to civilization. My guide and I were stuck for the next 8 days in the wilderness with no quick or easy way back. As we started our journey, I realized we would be fine with heavy 65-pound pack. We had packed enough food I was sure. We hiked 10 miles on a trail to Luna camp and then another 7 miles the next morning until the bushwhacking began at Eliey Wiley ridge. I found myself during the first few hours of battling the brush taking five steps forward and either falling/sliding down the muddy terrain or taking 4 steps back. It was almost as if the Pickets were playing a cruel joke on me. I would take three or four tries to step up and over a fallen tree uphill from me. Or I would get caught in a thick slide alder, a weed-like tree with thick branches that refuse to let you through without a fight. Going downhill, these alder trees have slick branches that grow along the ground making it slippery and causing you to fall. Eliey Wiley RidgeWe also faced Devils club, aka the guardian of the Pickets. Devils club is a thorny plant that grows in wet areas and has thousands of sharp thorns on each plant. They grow close together making it difficult to cross without pain and being poked many times. These are some of the hazards of getting into the Picket range. Once on top of the Eliey Wiley ridge, we set up camp. The problem we ran into was none of the snowfields had running water coming out of them. They were all dried up. We knew it was a long way to the next water source. So we took out our ice axes and started hacking away at the downhill edge of the snowfield. After a few minutes of hard work, it had released enough water to allow us to rehydrate and have enough for cooking that night. The next morning we headed out and traveled on the side of the ridge. This involved a pile of very loose rock leading to unstable footing and several falls. The problem was, once I got a 60-pound pack moving in the wrong direction, I could not stop the momentum, which was caused by loose rocks shifting under my feet. I ended the day with multiple bleeding wounds on my arms and gruesome bruises on my legs. We pushed on the next day toward our first objective, Mount Challenger. We decided to stop at Wiley Lake. Mount ChallengerWilley Lake is a natural campsite with stunning views of the lake. The lake is surrounded by huge ice cliffs on two sides and has an ice bottom. Moving on the next day, we made it to the base of Mount challenger by mid morning. We setup our camp for that night and set off to climb the peak. The Challenger glacier was not broken up much and was an easy climb. We got up to the Bergshrund in about 2 hours. The normal route was not crossable due to the melt out. A schrund is a large several hundred feet deep crevasse that looks as though it has no bottom. We had to improvise if we wanted any chance to summit. We spotted a 55-60 degree snow climb on an exposed ridge to the far left. As we headed there, we found a natural route to the summit. We climbed and tried not to look at the 1500 foot drop offs to either side of us as we climbed. From the top of this, it was an easy 30-minute traverse across a snow ridge to the summit pyramid. The climb is about 5.3 but it feels much harder if you are wearing mountaineering boots. I had double plastic boots on so I could not foot jam. Therefore, it was all arms. I pulled myself the final 80 feet to the summit, which is a bird’s nest type of feeling. It is a little spot big enough only for two people to sit on but the views of the virgin untouched wilderness are stunning and unmatched in the cascades. After repelling down the summit pyramid and down climbing the steep snow ridge, we headed back to camp. Lousy LakeOn the fifth day, we headed out from camp for a huge 10-hour push with full loads to Lousy Lake. We setup camp on a rock island about 30 ft into the lake, which contented spectacular views of the surrounding peaks. Louise Lake is a glacial lake that had a huge glacier on one side and a rock/ice plug on the other side holding the water in. It had deep, algae, green colored water due to the glacial sediments. Even with this color, the water was very pure, clean, and great for drinking. That night there was constant rock fall off the glacier into the lake. We looked at the wall of the glacier on the edge of the lake and noticed it was separated from the rest of the glacier, tilting towards the lake. We even joked about the possibility of the wall falling into the lake causing a tsunami, which would blast us off the island we were on into the rocks on the edge of the lake. Well, soon thereafter, we heard loud cracking that went on for about 15 seconds. We got out of our tent and looked just in time to see the ice wall fall into the lake. We stood stunned, unable to do anything but wait and see what would happen next. We watched as a huge wave formed. However, lucky for us, we found out later the lake is only about 10-20 feet deep and the impending wave of doom ended up 2 feet below our tent platform. It was a scary sight to see and we were thankful it did not turn out worse. Mount Fury The following day we headed back toward Mount Fury to attempt the northwest face, which was not in the greatest condition. It was stained by rock fall on the left side of the route. We had hopes to find a route up the right side of the lower portion of Fury’s NW face then cross the rock fall area quickly to minimize the risk. In hindsight, this was a not great plan but we thought we would try it. The closer we got to the route, the more we could see what terrible shape the route was in. We started climbing the steep snow and ice up, about half way to the top of the rock fall area (shown in the photo). There were boulders twice the size of cars coming down the far side of the route. The final factor that led us to turn around was a huge ice serac the size of a house came crashing down the west side of the face. It shook the earth so much it made one of my ice axes pop out of the ice. This is quite a scary feeling when you are two-tool ice climbing up a 60-degree face. We decided to turn around after this as the objective danger was off the charts. We then, as quickly as possible, repealed down the face keeping an eye at all times on the ice cliffs above. We got back to camp very thankful that any rocks or large ice chunks did not hit us. Luna PeakWe headed up Luna Peak, to the saddle, the next day where we were going to camp and attempt Luna the following day. It was a difficult day since I had torn up my feet the day before. My wet feet never really dried the whole trip because of all the rain. I had large, deep, open sores on my feet that made me limp slightly in pain with every step. We made it to the saddle about 4 pm and enjoyed the views of the Southern Pickets and the rest of the Northern Picket range. We had an alpine start to attempt Luna but we ended up calling off our summit about half way up because of my feet. We headed back down to camp, packed up, and head down through access creek for another full day of bushwhacking. We enjoyed the pleasures of slide alder, devils’ club, fighting wet brush out of our way, and balancing on slippery logs across rivers. We down climbed and hiked for about 10 hours until we finally reached Beaver creek. We had a 2-foot wide tree that had fallen across this fast flowing creek about 100 feet wide. It would be very bad to fall at this point. The risk of drowning was very real. I slowly shuffled my way across the creek and made it across. I was greeted by a 200-yard field of devils’ club and then I was back on the trail, 1 mile away from Luna camp. The Home StreachWe arrived at Luna camp and I was very happy to be there. Having dealt with rain all day and being soaked after falling into a smaller stream we had crossed early that day, I was ready for a break. That day left my feet sloshing in 3 inches of water inside my boots. To make it worse, the sores on me feet had gotten much worse making it almost impossible to walk without a limp. Back at Lousy Lake, we were able to tape my feet to my insoles to limit the movement of my foot inside my boot. This helped a little but the pain was still horrible. It made me almost a cripple around camp without my boots on for protection. Tasks like getting water and going to the bathroom were huge ordeals since they involved putting pressure on my torn up feet. This was not the end of the trip though. We still had 10 more miles or so of hiking on Luna trail to the boat dock the next morning. The next day was full of pain and agony in my feet. Every step hurt but was made even worse by the pressure of my heavy pack. I reached the dock about 1pm. I could not believe I had made it. Just days before, I never thought I would make it to the dock. We caught a 2-hour nap while we waited for our water taxi. The final test of stamina was, once back at Ross lake resort, we had one final mile of uphill climbing to reach our car. It seemed like forever but I was very glad to see the parking lot. We made it back to the car safely. [img:334318:aligncenter:medium:] SummaryAs an entire expedition, I would consider the Pickets successful. They are a special place for me. They are where I learned what real mental toughness is. I learned about planning expeditions, a lot of wilderness navigation and how to analyze objective hazards. This mountain range charges a high rent… payable in sweat, blood, and tears. The reward is worth it all, a spectacular experience of a hidden treasure and beauty in northern Washington. While I did not have the best experience in the Pickets, it was priceless. Maybe someday I will get back there, back to the land guarded by alder, devils’ club, and miles of despair and agony.

Your story makes me want to pick up that pack and ice axe and head north. From my wanderings in the North Cascades I prefer approaching the Pickets from Sourdough Ridge in the south and down to Luna Lake. Too bad you didn't make it up to the top of Luna. The views from Luna Peak, Jack Mountain or Crater Mountain are considered the best in the Ross Lake area because they are isolated from the mountains around them. There is one bushwack in the North Cascades to avoid at all costs. Goodell Creek to Newhalen from the Mt. Truimph area is a terror. Two of my climbing companions made the mistake of taking the ""short cut"" out of the area and spent three days wading in ice cold water, fighting through vine maple, devils club, and nearly drowning forcing a crossing of the creek in July runoff.

What really struck me is how much the glaciers have receded since climbing there in 1968. I'd say they're about half the size we encountered.

Murph1 - Nov 10, 2007 12:51 am - Hasn't voted Lousy Lake My take on the name comes from the fact that those first climbers in the area in the 1950's found there is no good campsite near it.

single-day,Mount Thomson East Ridge Solo,"Love at First Sight Mount ThomsonSo one day I was having lunch with some friends when -bam!- there she was! The most gorgeous little thing I had seen in years, her beauty was stunning. She really stood out from the crowd. I wanted to say something, but it was like my tongue was tripping over its own taste buds and all I could utter was “Wow!” It was love at first sight and I knew that we were meant to be together. No, I’m not talking about the first time I saw my wife, sorry sweetie, this here story is about Mount Thomson! The first time I saw Mount Thomson was on top of Kendall Peak. A friend of mine invited me along on a hike he was planning to the Kendall Katwalk. I’m not much into hikes without summits, so fortunately Kendall Peak summit is very close to the Kendall Katwalk and I was able to convince my friends to hit the summit while we were there. They agreed, although reluctantly. I was the first to the summit and was greeted by a most impressive view of Thomson. I instantly fell in love with the mountain. I loved its profile, its sheer ridges, and its vertical relief from the surrounding scenery. I knew I was going to find my way up to the summit sooner or later, and turns out it was sooner. Three weeks later I set off from my home town of Chehalis, WA at 5 am for the 2 hour drive to the trailhead. Kendall Peak Summit - First View of Mount Thomson To Bushwack or not to Bushwack?During my research for the trip I had read about a couple of shortcuts. The first involved taking the Commonwealth Basin Trail instead of the PCT for the first leg of the hike to save about a mile worth of trail. This was a no brainer since I had been on the Commonwealth Basin trail twice before and it’s a great trail even though it is “abandoned”. The second shortcut I was contemplating was a cross country route that involved some bushwacking but supposedly saved 2 miles. I had read several trip reports of people attempting this route without much success. Here are some excerpts: ”...The first shortcut follows Commonwealth trail and is nice but the second one is a complete bushwhack and not recommended. This shortcut not only did not save any time it also wasted us.” ”...There is no boot track heading down to the Commonwealth Creek. We bushwhacked up and climbers left and it was awful, dangerous bushwhacking and 4-5th class loose veggie cliffs before we finally got to the trail again.“ “...I took Alternate Shortcut 2 up to Kendall this past week. I am not sure if its really the much ""shorter"" in that it takes a while to bushwhack… I ended up up and down climbing to make my way around cliff bands.“ ”...After some more brush-battling when the talus slope petered out we ran into more snow covered slopes, and then after a short steep section we finally stepped onto the PCT. Great success! By this point we were about 6 hours into our adventure, and an aging hiker who passed by as we were regrouping on the trail told us that it had taken him just 4 hours on the PCT.” So did I listen to all this sage advice? Of course not… I took the bushwack route! I made quick time up the Commonwealth Basin trail, up to the PCT, and to the big switch back where the bushwack route starts. As I stared off into the brush I kept trying to convince myself that this was a good idea. Eventually I took the plunge and stepped off into the foliage. The going was slow and tedious, in fact it was miserable. About 10 minutes in I contemplated turning back and cancelling the trip all together but I pressed on. Tired of forcing my way through shrubs on steep sidehill, I decided to just head straight up the mountain. I had seen pictures of the west side of Kendall and I knew that eventually the terrain would open up. After another 10 minutes of plowing through bushes it opened up! Right into some cliffs! There was a nice looking class 3 gully across the way, but alas, it was blocked by a 30-50 foot ravine with no possible way to downclimb. Again I considered turning back and I was reminded of a quote from Jim Birdwell: “A sense of uncertainty that is potentially fatal is what makes climbing an adventure. Anything less is just working out.” I certainly felt the uncertainty part, although if I had actually though my life was at risk I would certainly have turned around. Instead I pressed on and up the mountain dealing with multiple route finding challenges up the class 3 rock and vegetation covered slopes. I would make my way left, back to the right, and back left again several times before the terrain became largely dirt and talus and shortly after I reached the trail! Start of the Bushwack Cliffs! Doh! Morning Sun on Red Mtn I was pretty excited to reach the trail again. The bushwack route had taken me about an hour and certainly was an adventure. I was happy I took the bushwack route, but in hind sight I doubt I would do it again. I hiked the PCT a short distance to the Kendall Katwalk where I took out my GPS and looked at my stats: 2 hours and 2.8 miles! It WAS a shortcut!!! I saved about 30 minutes and about 2.7 miles of trail. I was pretty happy about this, and my legs still felt fresh. From this point on I was feeling pretty good. The weather was perfect, mid to low 50’s with a slight breeze, sunny, and clear cloudless skies. Great weather for a hike. I recall a trip report by mvs commenting on how much he liked the trail from the Katwalk to Ridge Lake and I would agree, this section of trail is lovely! I was so happy gently floating down the trail towards bumble bee pass. This is what life is all about folks! Soon after I reached the sharp turn in the trail that marks the boot path up to bumble bee pass. The trail was steep and climbed up a couple hundred feet and upon reaching the pass the views of Mount Thomson and the basin below were stunning! As I reached the basin I noted a small trickle of a stream coming from some remaining snow in the basin and was grateful that I would have somewhere to fill up with water on the way back. I eyeballed out a route through the boulders up to the notch on the east ridge of Thomson and started the hike up. Mount Thomson from Bumble Bee Pass Fall Colors Along the Trail View from Thomson's Basin Wrong Class 4 Route Correct Class 4 Route Lost and Found Lost Water BottleIn my research for the hike I had read the climber’s log for Thomson here on SP. The latest entry was from Josh Lewis who stated “Did this one with Gimpilator. Sad to say I lost one of my water bottles on this one. This is certainly one of the better I-90 peaks.” Well, on my way across the base of the cliffs towards the notch I looked down about 30-40 feet and spotted a water bottle! The thing was pretty beat up and looked like it had taken quite the fall with nicks and scratches all over it. I thought “I wonder if this is Josh’s lost water bottle?” and tucked it away in my pack. After I got back I PMed him a picture of the water bottle and sure enough, it was the one that he had lost on the belay ledge near the summit! Crazy, huh! :) The SummitI continued up a steep boot path and reached the notch, then continued on more steep boot path towards the summit. After a few minutes of this I longed for some class 3 rock to scramble up as the steep class 2 boot path was getting annoying. Unfortunately there wasn’t much scrambling up until the last couple hundred feet. I made my way up some easy class 3 and was searching for the 20 foot section of class 4 I was expecting to find. I reached a wall and sure enough, a 20 foot section that looked class 4ish so I climbed up. It was fairly difficult and I had to be careful and remember my holds for the downclimb. Once I reached the top I was disappointed to find nothing but cliffs. I had climbed the wrong section of class 4! Oops. I carefully made my way back down and followed left around the base of the rocks where I found another 20 foot section of class 4. Not wanting to repeat my last mistake I continued left around this route where the terrain got seriously exposed and there was no obvious way up. I turned back and scrambled up the last section of class 4 I had seen and it turned out to be the right route. It wasn’t too difficult. More challenging than normal class 3 climbing but there was not much exposure at all or at least much less than I was expecting. After this a little more scrambling and I was at the summit! Overcoat, Chief, and Chimney Rock Summit Self Photo Chair and Kaleetan The summit was amazing! Perfectly clear skies and a light haze of smoke from the fires off to the east made for some great scenery. The views of Overcoat, Chimney Rock, and Lemah were amazing and I could see Rainier, Glacier, and Stuart off in the distance. Chair and Kaleetan peaks looked good from this vantage point too. I spent close to an hour on the summit having lunch and soaking in the scenery. It was one of the best summits of 2012 for me by far. I signed the summit register and made my way down. I had no trouble downclimbing the class 4 although I did have to do that section facing in. As I made my way down the boulder field I ran into another party of three older gentlemen on their way up. They were pleased to hear that I was able to make it without protection since they did not bring any rope. One of the men said he had climbed it as a teenager without problems. I wished them luck and we continued on past each other. I hope they were able to make it up and down safely. Mount Thomson Summit View Until We Meet AgainOn the way back I stopped and chatted with a few day hikers, one of which informed me that there was possibly a bear on the trail. Another woman she had talked to said she saw the bear, and there was some bear scat on the trail. Fortunately I did not run into the bear and several hikers I passed remarked that they were happy that I was not the bear when they heard me coming down the trail. I decided to take the PCT back to the car instead of repeating the bushwack shortcut. I had had enough adventure for one day. Turns out to be a good decision as the trail back was nice and relaxing and took me about 50 minutes to get back to the Commonwealth Basin trail. A short while later I was back to my car and heading home. The whole trip took me 8 ½ hours car to car and was one of the best trips of 2012. I was one happy guy.

single-day,Not the Wright Mountain: An Avalanche Tale,"Trip StatsMembers: Gimpilator, EastKing, FTZE, Josh, Gabe Equipment Used: Ice Axe, Snowshoes, Common Sense Equipment Nearly Used: Avalanche Beacon, Shovel, Sattelite Radio, New Pair of Clothes Not the Wright Mountain: An Avalanche Tale Introduction Rarely do I ever write about trips where there wasn't a successful summit involved. However, this trip up Wright Mountain was an eye opener and well worth writing about. Though the trip lasted maybe six hours, there was quite a strong potential for this trip to have ended much differently than it did. We all learned plenty of lessons on this trip and the trip made all of us stronger. The largest lesson from this trip report is to always be aware of everything around you, and don't always trust the avalanche forecast. Winter always has its surprises and today was a classic example of an avalanche surprise. Avalanche conditions were supposed to be low today but that didn’t quite turn out to be the case with the mountain that we picked. Wright Mountain was not the right mountain and luckily we found that out before something serious happened. I think all us of feel very glad that the outcome was so positive. Gimpilator, Josh, Gabe, FZTE, and I decided to take a shot at Wright Mountain, which in summer is a fairly easy 12 mile 3000 foot elevation gain mountain right from the Alpental Ski Area. In summer, this mountain can be done in four to five hours. There is a great boot path that goes right around Snow Lake and heads right up to Gem Lake. From there, it is just a minor scramble to the summit of Wright Mountain. As you will see here Wright Mountain takes on a different character in winter. The Beginning of the Trip The weather today was cold and dry but visibility was perfectly clear. There was not a cloud in the sky throughout the beginning of the trip and it looked like all the forecasters that had called for little avalanche danger were going to be right. The only clue that there was going to be issues was the heavy wind. It was blowing snow off some of the higher peak and depositing it down below. We started off in the Alpental Ski Area and decided to head up the Snow Lake Trail. The Snow Lake Trail was very well used and there was a clear path from the trailhead on the way up. The views from the trail were absolutely breathtaking and clearly some of my best photography was taken today. This first section was easygoing and most of our breaks were to take pictures of the mountains. The well-used path headed all the way to the view of Snow Lake. The beauty from this trail was unreal and the mountains were very pretty in their winter setting. On the way up there were not too many people on the trail. The First Hint It was easy hiking to the viewpoint of Snow Lake. However, getting down to Snow Lake was a little more interesting. We decided to check a couple of slopes and glissaded down to the base of Snow Lake. Once at the base of Snow Lake we could see Wright Mountain. Josh took lead on the glissade and headed down the slope with Gabe heading right behind him. They set a good glissade path on the way down so the rest of us followed. I was the last one but I noticed on the way down I picking up a lot snow below my feet on a well-worn glissade path. Gimpilator and I tested the snow just to check the quality out. The snow was not compact at all, which gave us the first hint that the snow wasn't as stable as we were lead to believe. Luckily, we did not head too much more downhill and since we were at the base of Snow Lake, we were home free!! Or so we thought.... It was tempting just to cross Snow Lake and get to Wright Mountain. But we didn’t trust that Snow Lake wasn't completely frozen over. Because of that judgment we decided to go around the lake on the east side to hit our vantage point. After the glissades there was at first a simple traverse along the side of the lake. This section eased our nerves and we were feeling confident again. The Crux Everything was going ok until we hit one tricky slope on our traverse. This 200 foot, 45-degree angle snow slope leads all the way to the frozen lake. What we didn't know was that this was one spot though where the snow must have blown off the lake and loaded this slope with snow. Gimpilator was looking at a traverse of a ridge when he noticed some cracks in the snow on the slope. He and Josh turned and headed down where me FZTE and Gabe were checking out the lower slopes. Noting that we decided to head closer to the lake where we would stay low to cross the section. At one point a number of us stepped on the lake and quickly got reminded that the lake was not completely frozen. Seeing the bubbles rising to the surface woke Gabe up and we knew that we were not even going to be anywhere near that lake. Figuring this was the crux we proceeded on and crossed the section on the safest section above the lake. Gimpilator took lead on this section and we all crossed the section one at a time. We stay about five to ten feet above the lake and kept our voices down through the section. It felt very scary walking between a frozen lake and a slope, which could possibly go at any time. However, we traversed through it and at this point we thought we were home free because all we had was a mile and a half left. So after crossing this section we headed up a slope to what we thought was a ridge. After crossing that slope we didn't want to be anywhere near the slope of the lake again. We aimrf for the highpoint of a ridge where we could possibly traverse it all the way to Wright Mountain. Unfortunately, once we hit that ridge we realized that we were going have to go down and then head back up. So from here we decided to head down at the lowest angle of slope. AVALANCHE!!! LET'S GET OUT OF HERE By now we were checking for potential avalanche areas. Gimpilator and Josh were heading down the slope to check for cracks when Josh spotted a major crack in the snow right below his feet. Gimpilator spotted it early and cautioned us all of us. Josh took one kick at the snow and there went any plans, desire or thought of continuing this trip anymore. At that very moment the snow raised and released a mini avalanche. The crack in the snow just rose up and then the entire slope just gave way. The section of the snow was 20 feet by 10 feet and to see it rise and then fall put fear into us. Luckily for all of us Josh was not taken from the avalanche and stayed above the falling snow. He was very fortunate to stay above the mini avalanche and though he was shaken, he was ok. Without any hesitation we turned back. That was all the warning signs we needed. We were still 1.5 miles from the summit and there was no reason to go further. To be honest, even if we were 100 feet from the summit we probably would have turned back. We headed back to the top of the ridge took a small break and then headed on out of there. There we got something to eat and relaxed our nerves a little before starting our return voyage. The Trip Back We decided to head back the way we came because that area we knew best and we were too spooked to go up any new slopes. The crossing of that one slope was tricky but we did it the same way we did on our way up. We also stayed on the same trails that we established in order to not hit any undisturbed areas. Heading up the glissade chutes we established was physically tough but it was much safer that attempting to climb a new undisturbed slope. This 50-degree slope was steep but it was disturbed and though the bottom was full of deep powder, the top of the slope was actually very stable for kick steps. All of us were slow on this section but we got through the section in good shape for the return trip back. Once on the top of ridge with the view of Snow Lake we knew we were home free. On the ridge though head back to Alpental there was actually a well-used glissade path that went down to the Snow Lake Trail. This was a quick fun ride down to the path. Some of us glissaded all the way down the safe slope while others just glissaded to the trail. On the way back down the Snow Lake trail was much more crowded. We all made a quick pace back to the car. Gabe likes to run down trails and this well used path was no exception. So he did his typical run down this slope while the rest of us did more of a fast paced walk. Soon we were back at the car where took a deep breath and a sigh of relief after witnessing that mini avalanche first hand. Conclusion Overall it was a good trip, but we were very fortunate with the outcome. It will go down on paper as an unsuccessful attempt on good weather. But this trip could have different. First, we will not ever trust the avalanche forecast ever again and err always on the side of caution. Second, I think we will stop on the first sign of poor conditions, not the second or third. That being said though it was a great trip and I hope we all combine again to do a ton of other mountains.

Snidely Whiplash - Jan 11, 2010 11:18 pm - Voted 10/10 You made the right call. Better not to risk it. Good trip report on a worthy winter objective. I realize that I wasn't there, but I wonder if your avalanche danger could have been further minimized by staying on the regular trail route. As I remember, it pretty much stays in trees the whole time up to Gem Lake, and then even past there up the ridge around Gem Lake to Wright Mountain. EastKing - Jan 11, 2010 11:31 pm - Hasn't voted Re: You made the right call. I think if we were higher up on the ridge that might have helped out a little but then again I'm not too sure. If you click on the picture that actually was the location of the trail (http://www.summitpost.org/image/542590/542583/the-trail-around-snow-lake.html). That part of Snow Lake actually side traverses those slopes. In summer they don't look bad. But in early winter when all it take is a minor avalanche to send you in to frozen water and break some bones the side traversing of Snow Lake can be dangerous. Gimpilator has a link to both on his page. I think I like to take a second crack at this one though in early spring when the snow has consolidated more. Viewing: 1-6 of 6 to post!

single-day,Keepin it Gangsta on Philadelphia,"Part 1: Checking out the Place Eastking and I have often seen Philadelphia Mountain on the way to much of our climbs along the highway 2 area. On April 3, 2011 we decided it was time to attempt it. We got to the trail head around 6 in the morning and were making good progress on the trail. I was pleased to see water falls along the way as well as dry trail until we got about halfway to Lake Serene. Bridel Veil Falls Multiple Falls After a ways of walking we got to the turn off for Philadelphia Mountain which follows a nice ridge to the summit. This is where we put on our snowshoes. The snow than began to fall, but we did not mind, although would have loved to get some views. After breaking trail a ways I get to a icy snow patch which looking behind me it was too late to turn around. I carefully took a few more steps almost topping out of the steep section and then this is where I slipped. I fell 40 or so feet down hill with little harm although it had snapped my snowshoes (still effects me to this day). I had to rig my snowshoes to just barely work. Eastking Heading Up Snow Cornice Although we were making decent time, not only had my snowshoe once again fallen apart (due to the strap snapping earlier) but Eastking's work schedule made time a pressing matter. Looking at the given circumstances we decided to head back down. We still had a fun trip. Forest View to the North Part 2: Keepin it Cool  Sunrise on the Monte Cristo Peaks  Mount ZekesAlmost a whole month later on May 1, 2011 we got another opportunity for this mountain. A week earlier we had attempted this trip, drove to the trailhead but was turned back due to heavy down pour and viewless conditions. But this time, we got what we wanted. Sometimes not making the summit is a good excuse to come back to the mountain with success in good weather. When arriving at the trailhead it was a clear sky which some of the stars could still be seen in the morning cool air. When hiking through the forest we could see Mount Index and Mount Persis through the trees looking almost as if it were a peak from the Andes. Once the sun rose, there was enough lighting which I could start up my photography, which of course then means I also then end up having to run and catch up. Looking Below (North) Once we reached the snow the trail was nice and beaten in making traveling much nicer. I couldn't help but look in amazement at the flutings on Mount Index's impressive East Face. Once we got near the lake we put on our snowshoes and from here on out I broke trail until the summit. I wanted to make up for the last trip and be the breaker which now I had double jobs, the other one being the photographer. When ever I stopped I had to make sure I pushed on far enough so that I could pull my camera out of it's case, turn on the camera, take the photos, turn it off, and put it away. Video cameras in my opinion are a little harder to manage, which by the time I was done with this Michael would catch up and I would have to go back to trail breaking. One of Mount Index's Steep Gullies One of Mount Index's Many Edges Michael and Mount Index The Skykomish River Mount Index Panorama As we got near the summit I found some good view points through the trees which I was impressed, although a little off the main path.

Avalanches Pouring Down Mount Index Waterfalls on the Way Out On the way down I met a few nwhikers which is always cool. From here we dashed down to the car. The last minute of the trip I was dashing to the car, told Michael ""Quick! Quick, Eastking's coming and we got to go now!"" which we scrambled our stuff in and we drove out.

single-day,An 18 Hour Day On Mount Baker,"One Day Ascent via Easton Glacier Mount Baker Redwic and I wanted to climb Baker via the Easton Glacier. Prior to June we assembled a team of 8 climbers, all experienced and very strong. Unfortunately, a long period of bad weather in early June derailed our plans completely. We lost all of our team members. It was nearly impossible to find other glacier climbers who could be available on such short-notice. If the storm ever broke, we might only have one day to work with, rather than the standard two-day ascent. Could we travel the 16 miles and climb 7500 feet in a single day? Were we up to the challenge? Potential Hazards Of The Easton Glacier After another bad weekend (June 17,18) we noticed an upcoming weather window mid-week, just one day of clear skies, as we had suspected. Lucky for us, our supervisors at work were willing to cooperate. I contacted Joe (SP member Fjes6) and was happy to hear he had Wednesday off work. He asked if he could bring his friend Jeremy along. The four of us set off from the cars at 8pm Tuesday night. We carried no tents or sleeping bags, no room for error. Our intention was to climb Baker in one long push. I estimated that we would reach the summit around sunrise, or thereafter, and then get down below the glaciers before the snow bridges started softening. Before Dawn The first half-mile to the end of the road was still snowed in. Joe made a good recommendation for where we should cut up onto the Railroad Grade ridge. Part way up the ridge, the last light of day faded, and we switched to headlamps. We passed several groups of tents at the various camps and we later learned these were mostly students for the Alpine Ascents climbing course. Mountain Shadow We roped up at Sandy Camp. Redwic was in the back, ready to initiate Z-Pulley if needed, while Jeremy and Joe, were in the middle. We followed tracks to around 8000 feet. I felt bad for the previous climbers when I saw the tracks end at 8000 feet. Judging from the depth of the tracks, it had been raining when they were here. At 9500 Feet We passed by a couple small crevasses off to the side, but so far they few and far between. Perhaps with all the June precip, there was still too much snow to see the majority of them. I said, ""hey, maybe we won't see much in the way of crevasses"". Then I immediately wondered if I shouldn't have said that. The tracks ended at the base of a steep incline. I started leading up the slope until I heard a strange tinkling sound. I immediately froze in my tracks. Something in the back of my mind told me I had heard that noise before, and it was a bad thing. I took one more tentative step forward and then I could see it. I was on the very edge of a massive gaping maw, the largest I had ever been close to. Lincoln Peak Alpenglow The other side was at least 40 feet away. I couldn't see the bottom. The tinkling sound was caused by small icicles that were breaking off the underside of the lip. Someone down behind me asked ""how does it look?"". ""It looks like shit!"". They asked again, probably wondering if they had misheard me, and I said, ""It looks really bad"". I looked down at my feet and there was a large split in the snow that I hadn't seen at first. This whole lip could sheer off at any moment. I turned around and told the rope team that we needed to reverse direction. I told them to keep the slack out of the line. Redwic led the way back until we could try another way around the steep slope and giant crevasse. South Twin And North Twin We went to the right and passed between a series of very large crevasses. I wondered how Joe and Jeremy were feeling. This kind of thing can be pretty exciting/scary the first time. We continued to climb and had to cross over several smaller crevasses. Most of them were still covered enough that we could step from one lip to the other. Just after 4am there was enough natural light to see without headlamps. The crater was above us. We could see the gases pumping out and we could smell the sulfur on the wind. Volcanic Gas Above Alpenglow was now painting the peaks around us. The view of Lincoln and Colfax was especially good but we could also see the Twins, Glacier Peak, and Rainier very clearly. I was surprised about the lack of wind. We were over 9000 feet and the temperature was below freezing but very comfortable for climbing. At the rim of the crater we paused to absorb the ambiance while giant clouds of volcanic gas rose hundreds of feet above our heads. Sherman Crater Rim Beyond the crater we contoured the rocks and ascended far right of the Roman Wall. At this point I remembered my first ascent of Baker in 2006 and how the Roman wall had been icy and unsettling. But the snow conditions today were perfect, very firm but not the least bit icy. Sherman Crater We reached the summit around 8am. It was Jeremy and Joe's first volcano climb. A wonderful accomplishment! But this was also a historic moment for peakbagging in Washington State. At the summit Craig became the 10th person to complete the WA County High Points. But not only that. He also completed the WA County Prominence Peaks, the WA 25 Mile Isolation Peaks, and it was his 100th 2000 foot prominence peak. Pretty amazing if you think about it. I felt very proud of him and honored to be a part of this pivotal climb and several of the other challenging ones we had done together on those lists. I laughed out loud when he pulled out a bakers hat and put it on his head. Get it? A bakers hat on Baker. Steep Slope Above Sherman Crater We left the summit around 8:30am and followed our crampons tracks back down to where the deeper boot tracks were. The snow remained firm until that point but then it started softening up. Around 7500 feet we encountered some post-holing action which was discouraging now that the team was getting tired. At the camps we passed by several groups practicing various snow climbing and glacier travel techniques. It seemed a few of the new students looked at us longingly, jealously aware of what we had just done. Redwic The Baker Once we were off the glacier we untied from the rope. Joe and Jeremy went on ahead to meet us back at Joe's house to exchange gear. They were faster than us and we didn't want to hold them up. After a seemingly endless road walk, Redwic and I got back to the car around 2pm. It was hot and we were feeling exhausted after 18 hours of climbing. It was now approaching three full days without any sleep for me. Excitement and anticipation had kept me awake the night before this climb. On the way back to Mount Vernon I started hallucinating. I saw some very odd things on the side of the road. I stared at them hard, hoping that would make them go away, but they didn't disappear. I guess I was dreaming awake.   The Descent See also Redwic's trip report of this climb.

The climb itself was not really that bad. I think the majority of my exhaustion after the climb came from lying awake all night the day before.

single-day,The Battle to Summit North and Middle Chiwaukum,"The Trip Report Introduction Well it was 10 pm on Saturday and everyone was wondering what mountain to do. We originally were looking at doing Eldorado due to a number of absolutely incredible trip reports coming from the summit, but with a recent storm that came through the area and dumped a foot of snow on the mountain and the avalanche danger raised to considerable, Eldorado was knocked off the list. So which peak should be do next. Well after a lot of debate we agreed upon Middle Chiwaukum. Josh, Mike and I were familiar with this summit three weeks before when we fell short of the summit Middle Chiwaukum and settled for Point 7132 (North Chiwaukum as I discovered later). From North Chiwaukum we just stared at the summit of Middle Chiwaukum and stared in the defeat of the mighty mountain. For us this was a rematch of the mountain. The Beginning On this trip it was Gimpilator, Josh, Mike, Robin and I. We arrived at the trailhead at 6:30 am after a hairy ride on an ice road to the trailhead. Thankful Robin's car had traction tires otherwise this trip in wouldn't stopped before it started. We got ourselves ready and hit the road early. It should be noted that the road walk up to main climb is around the same distance as the actually climb. However with very little elevation gain and loss this road walk often only take an hour to complete. It is basically a none issue but you do gets some good views of nearby mountains from this road. Once at the trailhead we saw the footprints that we made the last time and begun to head up the mountain. As stated from the last trip report this section was very icy and the micro spikes and crampons broke out early. They stayed on up the steeper section of the trail until about 4500 feet when the snow got thicker and much less icy. The slope though remained very steep and it took the total team this time to broke trail. It was Josh though who was the strongest, followed by Gimpilator and Mike here and broke the most trail but everyone helped brake the trail. By 6000 when we hit the ridge the snow was fairly deep in spots. Coming out on the ridge stellar views were wide open with Middle Chiwaukum showing up in view at 6200 feet. Decision Time We hit a bump just before North Chiwaukum and Gimpilator decided to check the snow here for avalanche issues. The test was not promising at all. The snow here was very avalanche prone. It was decision time right here and it was head straight to the summit of North Chiwaukum and revaluate or bag it right there. Gimpilator broke out his avalanche probe and his shovel and decide to give it to one of us and took lead on the trip. He headed up to Point 7130 only to find the snow to be much more stable. Robin a little scared of the situation decide to stay back with her down and her ten essentials and emergency gear. The rest of us followed Gimpilator only after checking with Robin to make sure she was 100%. It was on Point 7130 we discovered that the snow was substantially more firm and safer. From there we went across the wide ridge all along giving look at the grand summit of Middle Chiwaukum. The views were very breathtaking but to honest I tried to get them out of my mind and focus on the summit and the task at hand. Summit Bid Once we got shoulder of Middle Chiwaukum we took a look at the task at hand. Chiwaukum Ridge looked quiet intimidating from below. We changed into crampons here and decided to go for it! One thing I have learned over the years is that these final climbs often look more intimidating than they often are. I discovered this with Painted Mountain and I was hoping this was the case. Gimpilator though took it very slow up the ridge here and solved the puzzle of this ridge like a magician. Take one slow step at a time he broke it down. Once over that crux we were on an easier slow heading to the corniced summit. The Summit With couple steps we were on the true summit of Middle Chiwaukum. We looked for the summit log but could not find it due to the new snow that has fallen in the past week. None of us wanted to put too much effort because the summit was very close to a cornice with a mighty huge drop-off. Once top we enjoyed stellar views of hundreds of peaks including, Big Chiwaukum, Mount Daniel, and Mount Rainier. To be honest this view on this day had to be one of the best views I have ever seen. We didn't stick around long but for the time we were on top it was pure nirvana. It is times like this that all of us put the effort into climbing. A special thanks here to Gimpilator for being a strong leader and getting us safely to the top. Heading Down Getting to the top though is only half way. Now we have to head down the mountain and with the addition of Point 7130 that was nearly 6000 feet of elevation. We were tired but we knew the task at hand. It was now time to start our journey down the mountain. Getting down from the summit ridge was much easier than getting up. The ridge was easy enough so that we did not have to down climb it. We were still cautious on heading down from the summit but much more comfortable. We cruised to the base of 7130 but the small 300 foot climb to 7130 became very tiring most of us and it ate up a lot of energy. So once on top of Point 7130 we took yet another small 5 minute break to refuel. After that we headed down and picked up Robin who was comfortable looking at us from a viewpoint on the ridge. There we put on our snowshoes and cruised down the fresh snow slopes. It was very an enjoyable snowshoe decent until we got off the major ridgeline. The trip here was a little more slippery with powder slowly giving way to ice. We kept our snowshoes on to about 4500 feet but were falling all over the place until that point. It was hard to get much balance on the snow and often I was on my backside than on my feet. Even after 4500 when we bare booted down to 3900 feet I was using a ton of energy heading down this slope. Finally at 3900 feet out came back the crampons and heading down became MUCH EASIER. Josh stayed with me here and we kept the crampons on all the way to the bottom where it was now getting dark. For the road on the way back I decided on snowshoes. It was a warmer day and I had little strength at this point to be post holing on a road walk. Plus I figured I could gather a lot of speed here because the road a gentle grade. I think this was the correct call because Josh and I were able to race on back and almost catch up with the others. An added bonus is that it was a full moon and though I broke out my headlamp. The headlamps were not really needed. The Conclusion Once back at the car I realize I was very over exhausted. Though I ate and drank more than I ever had before I had use a lot of energy. Once in the car I refueled on electrolytes and snacks and took a large nap in the car back to my friends place. I was very overtired the next day but now am slowly getting myself back to form. That being said I want to thank everyone for coming today. Josh did some great trail breaking while Gimpilator took over and safely broke a route to the summit of Middle Chiwaukum. Robin did awesome too and we want to thank her for the ride and for coming out to give this peak a shot. Next time Chiwaukum will be yours!! Awesome work team and a great summit.

multi-day,This is my America!,"Introduction After climbing Mount Pugh I wondered to myself ""what do I want to do for my birthday?"". Of course what would any alpinist want to do for their birthday? Go for an epic adventure! For a long time I've wanted to bike to Sahale Mountain considering that it's one of my favorite mountains. The word Sahale is a Native American word meaning high place, which fits the description well. It's mountains like these that I consider to be the most beautiful of places in the world. The adventure consisted of about 40 miles of traveling, the first part would be biking from the road closure half way though the valley to the trailhead. After that then to the pass, up Sahale Arm, and to the summit and back. We had a limited budget on what we could bring for food so Michael and I rigged up 3 bean burritos, a some what filled jar of peanut butter, a small bottle of jelly, a half loaf of bread, and some granola bars which would serve as our food for the entire trip. If everything went according to plan, we would be back Sunday. Unfortunately the rope deal complicated the trip beginning, my friend Mark Straub let us borrow his rope which we then made our way for Sahale. Day 1: Riding though the Cascade Valley Cascade Valley Hidden Lake Peaks Summit Fallen over Trees Road Closure By the time we got to Cascade Valley the sun was already setting behind the ridge. We had to make good time if we were to make this a success. The bike ride though the valley was a decent challenge in itself. The fact that I was using a bike from the 1980's and had a heavy pack on made it more exciting. Around mile marker 12 was where the construction was taking place, the bridge was in good shape, but they were reinforcing it. Quite often the Cascade Valley has been known for washouts though out the years which this year was no exception to this. A mile later we had a nice down hill ride which meant we would have to go back up on the way back. As we went down another hill I looked up and Johannesburg Mountain looming above with clouds over it which was formidable looking. Once we arrived on the up hill part we pressed on up as much as we could and then walked the bikes. We repeated this for miles though the valley. We did not see another person until the end of the trip. I was a little worried about the thought as we kept going further and further into the mountains, but at the same time it was a comforting feeling to not have to deal with loud noises, to have quietness, and the whole place to ourselves. Eldorado Peak from the Valley As we biked through the woods the sun started to set and it started to get darker and darker. We could see mountains through the trees glowing bright red. One of the mountains I remember was sticking out, my beautiful Sahale! It was quite an amazing feeling being out in these woods in the Cascade Valley. Johannesburg from the Road Sahale during Sunset Alpenglow on Mount Torment Eventually we arrive at mile marker 21. We knew that the remaining road from here was steep so we stashed our hikes off to the side behind a log near an old abandoned cabin. After a little bit further we took a break to filter some water and enjoy the scenery. A mile later we arrived at the Cascade Pass trailhead. As we walked along I would watch as clouds would rise over Cascade Peak and the Triplets with a little moon light giving it a really nice atmosphere to the place. The stars also made for a great show, I felt like a pioneer the way that it looked, just me, my brother, and the mountains. Normally this would be an easy hike to the pass but the bike ride, climbing Mount Pugh, and the heavy pack took its toll on us. It was beginning to feel relentless switch backing through the woods. Later that night we found a good place to camp. I went to sleep fast, which was very solid that night and woke up a little after sunrise. Day 2: Going for SahaleWe had breakfast which was waffles and syrup. The weather was very nice looking outside although with a bit of winds. Along Sahale Arm we found a small pond which was a good spot to purify water. At first we were skeptical of using it because it was a bit green but it was good enough to use. Sahale Mountain in View Mount Baker far Away Filtering at a Pond Bird Flying Over Flowers with the Triplets After this we hiked on up Sahale Arm until we arrived at the Sahale Glacier. This is where things slowed down. Michael had a hard time putting on his crampons but eventually figured it out. We roped up, attached our prusiks and were ready to go. At first we were making good time up until the slope got steep. There were large crevasses almost completely splitting the glacier making it questionable whether we could even make it. We had to cross back and forth across the glacier to get past them. It was a very cool feeling to be leading my brother up the mountain, feeling some what like a guide. Michael on the Sahale Glacier The crevasses crossed each other which worried me, but to our luck we found a snow bridge that worked well. And who says the Sahale Glacier is not much of a glacier. After a few hundred feet of walking though snow we unroped and headed up the South West Ridge. It started out as a scramble through rocks which were loose as we went up. As we were scrambling on the ridge I got to a point were I did not feel comfortable and decided I would have to turn around and find another way. When I got down Michael said he was done, so the last part I had to solo. Even starting out was worry some for me, I had to be careful and hold on tight to the rock which was solid. Sahale's Summit Block Upper Southwest Ridge Looking towards Brooker Loose Rock Ahead Michael Scrambling Sahale's South West Ridge Forbidden, Torment, and Eldorado Peak As I pushed myself further and further up the face I was some how almost in some kind of trance, perhaps summit fever. It got to the point were it felt like class 4, crazy emotions started striking me. The moment got more and more intense with each step until I got on the summit ridge about 100 feet from the summit. It was one of the scariest spots I have ever touched (back in 2009), I only took one photo from this spot and carefully put my camera away. Normally I would not have even taken the one photograph but I some how felt compelled to do so, the moment was so beautiful and view was unique. I looked up at the summit which looked at least class 5, way to dangerous to approach, not only did the ridge look loose, but a huge cliff and glacier were below me, and I decided to call it quits here. Boston Peak looked even more intimidating, I did not stay on this spot long because of the dangers, after this trip I found out I was on the wrong ridge. Down climbing it was frightening, I had to be very careful. Finally when I got to the class 3 part I felt a lot better. Boston Peak's South Face Glacier Peak with a Blue Haze As I was heading down a safer route I looked back at the summit block at what could of been the right way to the summit which I believe goes a little around the east part. I decided against it because not only did it look a little iffy, I was solo, and the sun was going to set soon. Even though we spent a good effort trying to summit, I decided it was not worth the risks and that Sahale will be there some day, and besides a return trip when snow covered would be better. One of the Many Crevasses South East View Dome Peak Panorama Sahale View Panorama I return to Michael, we rope back up and tried to get down as fast as possible to avoid the glacier freezing over. Heading down was not too bad, the place was starting to get sunset colors, and soon we were off the glacier. We repacked our gear and made a hurry down, it began to get cold quick, especially with the winds. On the way down we came back to our pond to filter more water. It was partly frozen making the process less enjoyable. Filtering the water was extremely cold, my hands started to go numb fast. Sunset from the Upper Arm Yours Truly during Sunset Late in the Day Looking Down Sahale Alpenglow on Sahale Soon it became dark which we arrived at camp with the winds picking up. After eating and such we went to bed. As we were about to go to sleep we started seeing lighting up parts of the tent which frightened me at first because I had no idea what was going on. To our amazement the wind was creating static electricity which glows in the dark, but I was so tired that I soon fell asleep. Day 3: The Return back HomeWhen I woke up the sun was up which meant it was time to go and pack up our gear. We originally did not expect to stay a second night but considered it possible, so our food supply was short. I drank out of the jelly jar and ate strait up peanut butter. Johannesburg from Below Cascade Peak's North Face Sahale from the Valley Johannesburg's Summit Block Eating the Last of the Food Heading down was not as difficult as I had expected it to be, for the most part it was easy, although I had become quite thirsty by now due to the lack of water we had left. A ways down the road we hit the creek again and filtered some more water. By this point we were running down the road, although I had to stop because it became a bit much running down the steep road with heavy packs and being tired on a hot day. At least the conditions were nice. Walking the Bike though the Cascade Valley We soon got to our bikes near the cabin and started heading down. After a few miles we got to the down hill section which worried me due to the slope and turns, Michael was way ahead of me, and I did not slow down much because I did not want to fall behind. Later when we got to the bottom of the hill we took a break, Michael noticed the strange noise coming from the bike (this was the same bike I used on my Steven's Pass Attempt Trip which tends to get a lot of friction). Michael ""fixed it"" or at least for a little while, until the clicking came back, we swapped bikes which was so much easier on me when going up hill. ""And I thought going up hill on my bike was bad enough"" Michael told me when we got to the top of the hill. We swapped back, for good reasoning to. I took one last look at Johannesburg before riding down the other side of the hill. I would have taken more photos but I already deleted enough photos as it was because I was using a memory card which had 128 megabytes of space which I was disappointed about. After biking, and sometimes hiking up hill we later got to the construction zone which I was glad to see them at work on the road. After this we biked down hill and then were at the car. From here we drove home. I had to miss Monday of school which we had not expected to miss but ended up having to. This was an exciting adventure which I been so long wanting to return here, I hope to go up to the summit some day. After all, This is my America! Images View This is my America!

single-day,Forbidden Peak East Ridge Direct,"""Oops, my crampons are at my parent's house in Renton!""I had Wednesday off work so I asked Chico if he wanted to go climb something. He quickly agreed and the plan to climb the east ridge of Forbidden Peak was born. The plan was simple, I'd get off work at 6:00 pm on Tuesday and head strait home to pack up my gear. Chico would meet me at my apartment in Ballard around 8:00 pm and we'd leave as soon as possible after that. All was going very well until we started loading gear into Chico's car. I had everything loaded and remembered that I needed to get my crampons! ""They're just in my car, let me go in the garage and get them out,"" I told chico as he started his car. But upon looking in my car, they were no where to be found. Then it hit me, I have been house sitting for my parents while they are in Australia and the last time I climbed something I slept there the night after, leaving some of my gear. I could picture them sitting just under the fireplace... :( So I had a decision to make, either take boots and heavy crampons (didn't sound fun), or running shoes and no crampons (didn't sound as safe). I chose the running shoe option rationalizing that I'd just chop steps! We set off from Seattle around 8:15 pm and made it to the trailhead around 11:30 pm. I'd read trip reports of people sleeping on the ground at the trailhead and having critters run all over them at night. I didn't want that so I slept on the roof of Chico's car. It was a cloudless night and never got cold at all. bed for the night, the roof of a car The Climbat 3:50 am the alarm on my phone went off and quickly Chico and I were awake and packing last minute things. A few minutes earlier another car had pulled up and there were two other people packing. Turns out they were going to climb the torment forbidden traverse (we saw them from the summit and I'm pretty sure they bailed at the west ridge notch, although I don't know why because it was around 1:00 pm when they were at the notch). Anyway, we left the car around 4:14 am. We weren't sure how long the trip was going to take us. All I knew was that I had to work at 8:00 the next day and wanted to sleep a little before working 9 hours. In the back of my head I assumed this trip would be an epic! The trail up to Boston Basin was fairly eventful, except for the constant brush in our faces and the always nagging side alder trying to pull the ice axes off our packs. We made it to the basin in a little under and hour and a half. Forbidden was already looking fun! the first good view of forbidden Neither of us had been to Forbidden before so we lost the trail at the creek crossing and ended up going about 100' (vertical feet) up the creek before crossing it. Because of this we had to cross some slippery slabs. Chico wiped out and I watched his slid down the slabs about 20' after hitting his head fairly hard. It was a scary few seconds but he is tough as nails and we were soon on our way, Chico a bit dirtier than before. oops, he slipped! We found the trail and followed it up until it was all snow. We took the first gully we could find to make out way up to the small glacier. Here we filled up water and rester for a few minutes. Continuing up with some scrambling and snow, we reached the edge of the glacier and looked for the ""gully"" Beckey talks about in his route description. I thought it'd be more of a gully rather than a snow slope leading up to a minor scramble. Thankfully, the snow was more than soft enough for sunning shoes! Within no time at all we were in the sun an on the east ridge. into the sun mount buckner and the boston glacier I led out on a fairly uneventful first pitch which I stretched out for a full 60 meters. Chico followed quickly and was soon standing on top of the first real large gendarme of the ridge! Chico on the first big gendarme Before this second pitch, the climbing was a bit loose, but here things became much more solid. At the top of the gendarme, the climbing began to feel like a ridge climb as the ridge narrowed and the exposure increased. I arrived at the to of the gendarme to see Chico belaying at the base of the knife edge traverse pitch! I was super excited to lead it. Chico belaying just before the knife edge traverse I started out on the traverse a little alarmed at how hollow the rock sounded, but the pure fun of the climbing soon took over and the rock became solid again. A little less than a year ago, Chico and I were climbing the knife edge of Dorado Needle. The memories rushed back as my fingers gripped the knife edge of rock and my feet smeared on the solid rock... what a way to spend a day! But the traverse was over far too soon and I was climbing toward a belay. looking back after the traverse, chico is just after the knife edge part pitch chico finishing the traverse pitch The next pitches went very quickly and were fun climbing up and over gendarmes and across narrow sections of the ridge. We were swinging leads and it seemed that Chico got to climb all the gendarmes and I got to do all the thin ridge climbing. This was true for the crux as well. I climbed to the base of the crux pitch and set a belay for Chico's lead. He led the crux with confidence, though a little surprised to find the actual crux a move after what he thought would be the crux. The climbing on this pith was solid, protectable and slightly overhung, a thrilling pitch for sure. chico pulling the crux Chico set a belay shortly after the steep gendarme as the rope drag was fairly bad coming over such as bad angle. Since his pitch was so short, he led out on another pitch, this time much easier. In the middle of the pitch he called back, ""check this out!"" As I look up I see him hanging in the air doing a heel hook on an overhanging section. heel hook! HAHA! I had to laugh, only Chico would go out of his way to find something to heel hook on while in the 8th pitch of a route like this. Anyway he climbed about 40 meters then set a belay on a great exposed horn and brought me up. I took the lead and less than 30 meters later I was standing on the summit. It was just before 1:00 pm. I belayed Chico up who was surprised at how short the pitch was. On the summit we took pictures, signed the register and then began our descent. We could see the two climbing the Torment Forbidden Traverse. Just before we started down they were at the West Ridge notch. chico arriving near the summit signed summit register classic summit shot coiling the ropes before rappelling a few times We took the East Ledges descent since the West Ridge couloir looked like it wouldn't be as fun in running shoes without crampons. We did a few rappels down the ledges than got sick of rappelling and just put the rope away and downclimbed/traversed our way back to the notch where we started. I had heard so much about the east ledges and how sketchy they are. I found them to be quite simple and easy. We were back at the ridge in no time at all. scrambling the east ledges From the notch, we cruised down the slopes back to the ""gully"" which we downclimbed carefully (much sketchier than the east ledges in my opinion). Once we were back on snow, we did standing glissades down all the way to the trail. The trail to the creek crossings was easy, but we both were a little worried about crossing the creek during such a hot part of the day. boston basin is beautiful last look back at forbidden The first creek crossing was uneventful. The second however was a bit more tense. We arrived at the creek to this... the creek after the glaciers had been in the sun for hours All we wanted was to get back to the car so we could drive to the nearest restaurant and eat food. But a rushing creek was blocking our way. Two other climbers were waiting in the shade on the other side of the creek contemplating crossing towards us (I think I recognized one of them from MANY trip reports I've read... in fact, I'm pretty sure he should take half the blame for me getting into climbing, his trip reports were half the literature I read in college, the other half being MVS's trip reports of course... thanks for getting me though school guys!). Anyway, we wandered up the creek a ways to find a sketch crossing that led to a steep and slippery embankment traverse and eventually to solid ground (probably the crux of the day). It was a short 40 or so minutes and Chico and I were changing into cotton clothes at the trailhead around 5:45 pm. Turns out this trip wasn't as epic as I had imagined. Well, it was epic in the sense that we got to climb one of the most beautiful mountains and have it to ourselves in a day without any clouds or mosquitos and minimal black flies. But not epic in the 20+ hour day with no water or food in the freezing cold type of way. Sitting in the parking lot we stared up at Johannesburg. We were both thinking the same thing, ""that's next, the NE buttres, it would HAVE to be epic!""

multi-day,Battle on Mt Rainier's DC Route,"June 4th 2013 - Tuesday Ugh…the 14 hours of hell. If you’ve ever driven 14 hours straight then I salute you. For you sir or madam, are a true champion.  Also, I truly feel that paying this price for a mountain should tell you just how much we wanted to experience Rainier. Tyler, Jason, Bri (who was not climbing) and I (Anders) began our journey at about 2 AM, leaving Salt Lake City and heading straight for Paradise, WA for our permits.  I think the worst thing about this drive is the portion through Oregon where you can only go 55 or 65 and they make you feel all posh by not letting you fill your own gas tank. It made me long for the stretches in Utah of I-15 where they give you an 80 mph limit. The only redeeming thing about the Oregon stretch is the preponderance of Dairy Queens. My belly ached for a constant supply of cookie dough blizzard. The little voice inside me said, “Not yet…you only deserve a treat after you summit Rainier.” Cast of characters: Tyler ""Coach"" Jason ""Ace of Jace"" Bri ""epithet needed"" Anders ""Your author"" We arrived at the Nisqually park entrance at about 3 or 4 PM. I wasn’t thinking too clearly because we had received some very aesthetically pleasing views of Rainier. We were hoping we could get our permits right at the entrance. We rolled out of the car and went inside the information center. There was a precious model of Rainier, a topographical map type thing. I can only imagine all the kids with jam hands who have touched it, but I didn’t even care. I didn’t hesitate to trace the Disappointment Cleaver route with my finger, suppressing the impulse to wash my hand. Finally we walked over to the ranger sitting at his desk. He was a pleasant young man and our conversation went something like this ( it probably didn't happen):      “So, we want to climb the mountain,” said Tyler, brimming with confidence. I can only imagine what the ranger was thinking. Here we were…three guys and a girl all wearing flip flops and shorts and smelling of car funk. “What mountain?” He asked dubiously.      “I’m sorry,” I said, being a real sicko. “I thought we were in Rainier National Park. Aren’t we in Rainier National Park?”     “Oh,” he said, still perplexed that people in flip flops wanted to climb the mountain. “What kind of gear do you have?”           “Oh, we’ve got our stuff in the car,” Tyler said, putting all joking aside. “We just need the permits.”   Mt Rainier - from the south. June 4th 2013 The ranger then instructed us to head to Paradise. From there it was a fun little drive up the mountain to the Jackson Visitor Center. Once there we filled out the form for our $44 (each) climbing passes and the nice lady ranger hooked us up with a group permit. I was named climbing leader of our small and yet sexually charismatic party (Bri’s words). I think I was picked mainly because I think Jason and Tyler didn’t want to fill out the form. I would later have to suppress giving commands like, “take a picture of me over here,” or “feed me a stray bird.” Anyway, it was probably the best form ever and we never talked about who was leader again. We wandered around for a bit and then made our way to Spanaway, WA to spend the night with Bri’s aunt and uncle. Just a short digression…they were very nice people and their farm was really pretty. Their horses were pretty much flirting with me to take their pictures the whole time. June 5th 2013 – Wednesday As you can see the horses were flirting all day, trying to get me to take photos of them.We had kind of a late start getting up and ready. Bri’s aunt made us a great breakfast of eggs and muffins and we set off. We arrived at the trailhead in Paradise at around 8:45 AM. Bri was nice enough to take some pictures of us and then she drove away. It’s like she didn’t even care. I think she just wanted to visit with her friends in Seattle. Anyway, there was nothing for it but to begin our journey!  Tyler, Jason, and I begin our journey from Paradise. We started hiking up the trail from the visitor center at 9:15 AM. There were a few clouds obscuring the summit, but there were no other clouds in sight. It was looking to be a very good day. Soon we were off on the snow plodding up the hill. We met a guide who gave us a few pointers. Jason had actually gotten off trail, but the guide pointed us in the right direction. We pulled out some false bravado and told him we were going for the summit and butchered Ed Viesturs motto that “getting to the top is optional.” Instead we said, “getting to the top is mandatory. Getting back down is optional.” Despite saying this many times no one thought it was funny. Okay, let’s have a “realtalk” moment. My climbing partners and I have actually turned back on plenty of mountains. Weather, time, or snow conditions can really dictate if you will press on or not. The mountain will always be there…unless it explodes like St Helens…but even then I guess it’s still there. So, we just enjoy the experience for what it is and live to come back another day. We were actually humbled by the magnitude of the mountain and were trying to keep our spirits light and our motivation high. Okay, real talk moment over. Jason leads us astray...which seems odd because the whole route is wanded. I think you actually have to summit Rainier to gain permission to slide down the this slope. We passed a few day hikers who were struggling up the steep slope beneath Panoramic Point. Now this was more like it! I l appreciated the steepness of the hill but the sun was coming out in full force, making me sweat. I was wearing a sleeveless Marmot trail running shit and my Arcteryx Rampart rock climbing pants. Despite the thinness of my clothing my body refused to stay cool. It was as if we had brought the Utah sun with us and unleashed the fires of hell. Seeing as how I had been a good boy all day this hellfire didn’t make much sense to me. Throughout the course of the day it would only get worse. We took a short break near Panoramic Point...it was probably the second best break ever. Anyway, this is the view. I'm pretty sure that's Mt Adams in the background. Jason didn't even care. Tyler takes a breather as he waits for Jason and I to catch up. It was about 10:20 AM by the time we made it to Panoramic Point. There was a nice jumble of rocks to sit on, but I was too busy snapping shots of the surrounding mountains to be bothered. It was about this time that I really wished I was wearing shorts or maybe a loin cloth. I think future trends will be the gaiter loin cloth combo. It’s totally going to be a thing. Anyway, after a short reprieve we were off again.  We passed a few more people and realized that the snowfield seemed to go on forever. There were a few AT skiers slogging up and they passed us. I’m pretty sure I mumbled curses at them as they passed us. It wasn’t because they were going faster; please don’t get the wrong idea. I was jealous of their skis and wanted some of my own.  The snow was quickly becoming a mess. I’m grateful for the many people who had broken trail before us, because it made the going so much easier. Anytime we got off the beaten path we would post hole like…old man Winters digging holes for posts back on his farm. If you want to know more about Old Man Winters…just think of the guy who would yell and get belligerent if a Frisbee landed on his yard. Our team became increasingly more spread out; Tyler in front, me in the middle, and Jason bringing up the rear guard. It is a well-known fact that I do not do well in heat. It’s pretty much my kryptonite. I sweat too much and it just so happened that I hadn’t brought enough water. I had one liter of water and a liter and a half of Poweraid. There was no way I was breaking into my full liter of Poweraid, as that was to be used for the summit day. This meant that I became increasingly belligerent the hotter it became. I began to throw snowballs at complete strangers, but in retrospect I’m pretty sure it was just Tyler. I began to just put snow in my mouth and let the volcano that was my insides melt it. It worked somewhat but eventually I noticed that Tyler had stopped to rest on some rocks. I was glad for the rest and I couldn’t see Jason behind us, so it was probably for the best. I’m not sure exactly where we were below Camp Muir but we put it at about 1500 feet maybe. I downed a few breakfast bars and 300 calories later I was feeling pretty good.  We took quite the long break and I took the opportunity to take some more pictures.  Jason thought we were making our way up a volcano...not that it was in his shirt! So...we decided that the Muir Snowfield should be given the very appropriate epithet...Never Ending Snowfield. Tyler ponders the meaning of life as we indulge in our second break for the day. We were about 1000 or 1500 vertical feet below Camp Muir. The cloud turned our day into a white out. It actually made the sun more bearable...but it was now humid within mr cloud. If you look close you can see Tyler in front of Jason. About 30 minutes after our break spot we were hit by a cloud that whited out our long rang vision. I literally couldn’t see more than a hundred feet or so in any direction. I loved it. Along with my increased caloric intake, the lack of direct sun made me feel even better. I’m pretty sure I should only climb at night or in white outs now. At first I was saddened that my cloud friend left, but as it departed I was graced with the sight of Camp Muir only a few hundred feet before me. Mr Cloud decided to be nice and part just as I neared Camp Muir. It was 2:00 PM when I waddled into Camp Muir. So it took us about 5 hours to make it up 4500 vertical feet. Considering the hot nature of the day I was fine with this result. Tyler was sitting on a rock in the sun whistling the song of his people (he is a ginger). We chit chatted with one of the guides as we waited for Jason to arrive. He was a nice guy and gave us some good information about our summit day. He seemed pleased that we were pushing to Ingraham Flats and let us know that would make our day easier. He also told us to try to be off the Disappointment Cleaver by around 9 AM because the shallow snow there had been turning to mush in the heat. I ate some more Sunbelt raspberry filled breakfast bars as we listened to the guide. I contemplated eating the banana in my pocket, but I decided not to just yet. Jason arrived about 20 minutes after I did and we had a good time laughing and reminiscing over our journey. We put on our crampons and harnesses and were off again about 3 PM onto the Cowlitz Glacier.  Jason makes his way out of the clouds and into Camp Muir. It was so nice sitting on the bench. It rejuvenated me for the push up to Ingraham Flats. Some guides at Camp Muir. They loved our idle banter so much that they pretended not to listen intently to every minute of it. Jason rejoins us at Camp Muir. Tyler gets ready for glacier travel. Our first glacier to cross...Cowlitz. Look close...you can see 4 teams of 4! We gave Jason the sharp end of the rope to set our pace and I was given rear guard duties as I have more mass than Tyler or Jason. We figured I would be a good anchor if Jason fell through a snow bridge. The sun was really slapping us about now. Despite reapplying sunblock several times I could feel the sunburns coming. Looking back at Camp Muir. Jason wanted more sun, so we stopped to throw snow balls. Crossing the Cowlitz Glacier we passed about four parties coming back from successful summit bids, which is always nice to hear. We had heard that only about a week before there had been a lot of snow dumped on the mountain which had deterred several climbers. This news invigorated us and put some spring in our steps. We shot up Cathedral Gap (passed some rocks that had fallen in the snow) and received our first sight of the Ingraham Glacier and Little Tahoma. I must say that this “little” mountain on the side of Rainier looks rather imposing. It was here that the crevasses were much more prevalent. We could see how massive the ice was and how beautiful as well. And wouldn’t you know I had my camera out! We crested a small hill and we could see where our camp would be on Ingraham Flats. We could also see the trail through Disappointment Cleaver. I must admit that it looked intimidating, as the trail just seemed to traverse a slope where if you fell it would be a short trip into a crevasse. I just told myself that it must not be as scary up close and it’s still only class II. I might have also told myself that there was a cookie dough blizzard waiting on the other side. I might lie to myself like this all the time.  Crevasse on the Ingraham Glacier Little Tahoma - Vicious looking mountain. First sight of Ingraham Flats - our high camp. If you look up and to the right from camp you can see the Disappointment Cleaver Route. We arrived at Ingraham Flats at a little before 4 PM. So it took us a little less than an hour to make it to our high camp from Camp Muir. We scoped out some places where we could place our tents and asked some gentlemen where we could go so as not to disturb the guides. They just told us where the guides had probed and just about anywhere would be okay. They even let us use their shovel to dig ourselves out a nice platform for our tents. Thanks guys, you were a big help! Now…please don’t judge us too harshly here, but we each brought our own sleeping establishments. I have a terrible time sleeping next to people so I brought my own Nemo “2” man tent. Jason brought a MSR Hubba Hubba (I think – I can never keep track if it’s the HH or Mutha Hubba) 2 man tent and Tyler brought his bivy tent. Our sleeping arrangements. By 5 PM we were all snug in our tents. I had changed into clean clothes and was covering up my sunburns. For dinner I used my Jetboil stove to boil water for my Mountain House spaghetti with meat sauce meal. It’s probably my favorite right now and it was just what I needed to send me into a food coma. I also made some Swiss Miss hot chocolate (sorry for all the product placement). I also made sure that I would have enough water for summit day. I would have 2 liters of water and a liter of Poweraid. Our talk and laughter died down and by 7 PM we were trying to get a few hours of sleep. Jason checks his phone for service...which he had! If you look past him you can see the route to the spine of the cleaver. Another shot of the route as it passes onto the cleaver. Top left you can make out the trail through the snow. June 6th 2013 - Thursday I was having a wonderful dream. I had just won the Quidditch world cup and Hermione…uh…then I started hearing my name being called. A burst of adrenaline must have shot through my heart because I was up in a start.  “The guides are already up and are waking everyone up,” Jason mumbled into the cool night air.   “What time is it?” I heard myself ask.  “About twelve thirty,” Jason answered.   “I wonder how cold it is…”      “If you want a Ginger’s guess…I’d say it’s 38. Want to know how I know that? Sleeping outside every other week.” (Tyler is a guide for a company that takes troubled youth and adults on wilderness retreats all over Utah). It would later turn out that Tyler was spot on with his temperature gauge. I thought it was a very pleasant temperature in my tent, but it wasn’t cold at all outside either. I then pulled out my trusty headlamp and found that it had been on all night. Sweet…Ithought. It was still shining so I thought it would be okay. Jason fired up my stove to boil some water for his breakfast of chicken and rice. The Propane/Butane mix was cold and so the stove took its sweet time boiling the water. Apparently one should sleep with the propane in their bag to keep it warm for best results. I contemplated making some brown sugar oatmeal but the thought of it made me want to never eat oatmeal again. I put down more raspberry breakfast bars and called it good. Jason asked if anyone wanted some of his meal and I happily obliged myself. I was all ready to climb so I just stood around shoveling the food into my face. Soon we were all roped up and ready to go. I had my audiobook playing in my earphone (I leave one out so I can hear my partners or nature. It’s the best of both worlds). We were the last to leave camp at about 1 AM. We could see the stream of headlamps before us, and we followed the beaten path. The snow was perfect. Our crampons eagerly bit into the icy crust and held up our weight nicely. It was a large contrast to the postholing we did during the daytime. We quickly caught up to the line of climbers before us and soon we were heading onto the cleaver. Suddenly the line stopped and the guides began to shout about the snow conditions. They told everyone to clip into the fixed line. The words “anchor!” and then “clipped!” began to be shouted into the cool night air. I had time to look about. We had the steep slope of the cleaver to our left and to our right the steep drop into darkness. Soon it was our turn to clip in and we were off following the lights up the steep cleaver. I was a little surprised at how steep it was, especially in the darkness. It also didn’t feel like we were going that fast and I kept wondering when the climbers from Camp Muir would catch up. I was grateful when we finished the traverse onto the cleaver and began going up. It felt like an eternity going up the fixed ropes. Finally we made it to the upper cleaver and we said goodbye to the fixed ropes. It was about this time that I could see the line of lights from Camp Muir. It looked ike they were kind of close, and I wondered if indeed they would catch us. We just continued to plod on and upward. It was a great night. There was just a little bit of wind to keep us from overheating. I was so warm all I had on was a base layer and a softshell jacket. Even my gloves were my thin hiking gloves. Remarkably, the line of lights below never approached too closely.  It was around 2:30 AM when we reached the top of thecleaver. The guides had their climbers sit down and put on their down jackets. They were very positive and motivating, telling them that they had just done the hardest part, but that if anyone wanted to turn around they should do so there. What? I thought. You just did the hardest part! The mountain is right there! But lo and behold, some of the climbers wanted to turn back. We noticed the nice climbing duo (who had lent their shovel to us the day before) headed out. After eating some more bars I was chomping at the bit to go. Sorry about the terrible quality of this shot...but it's the best one of the top of the cleaver...early in the morning. The wind decided to pick up a bit more at the cleaver top, but it was by no means fierce or strong. It didn’t have the bite of winter but felt more like the caress of spring. We started up again just before the guides prodded their clients to move. Jason set a nice even pace for us. The next section was pretty steep too, but I think after the cleaver we weren’t about to let anything phase us. I felt very comfortable with it. The snow was perfect and the night was beautiful. The constant pounding of our spikes in snow was rhythmic and even cathartic. I lost myself in the working of my muscles. The night kept my body cool and my limbs were poised in case either of my partners slipped or fell. Our feet were sure and any such heroics were not needed.  As you can see we had perfect conditions! This part was a little scary, so we crawled across the ladder. The higher we plodded up the lighter it became. The sun was still a ways from cresting, but I switched off my headlamp. It had become apparent that it was shining much more dimly than everyone else's. I had extra batteries, but I figured it gave enough light. We started to see the topography of the mountain. Crevasses were everywhere. Giant blocks of ice seemed fixed in place like the scales of some mythical beast frozen in place. The air was thin, but we were making good progress. Almost sunrise. We caught up to the duo at the crossing of a crevasse. A ladder had been set up to bridge the gap. We set up an anchor and belay for Jason to cross, and he crawled to the other side. Once there he anchored himself and set a belay for Tyler. I came across last and took a few pictures. It was now light enough to do so! We continued our methodical pace ever upward and eventually we overtook the duo. They had stopped for a quick break. Sunrise on Rainier The sun crested the horizon and it was such a splendid sight. It is moments like those that make me return over and over again into the mountains. The mix of red on white coupled with the perspective of being up so high made me almost giddy. I made my companions stop so I could try to capture the sight with my camera. Tyler checks things out as the sun comes up. We took a break right below the crater rim. A little below the crater rim we took a break at Tyler’s request. Our now climbing friend duo overtook us as we rested. I ingested more electrolytes and calories and soon we were off again. It was only a few minutes before we were standing on top of the crater rim. Columbia Crest was only a short distance away. I could see vents in the volcano, sending up plumes of steam…reminding me that the mountain was somewhat alive, but just sleeping. It was this point that we knew we were going to summit. The giddiness that threatened to overtake me at seeing the sunrise overtook me. I laughed and couldn’t stop smiling. It was a perfect day. We crossed the crater and made our way up the dirt and rock past more heat vents. Our crampons eventually bit into the firm snow of the summit. Our friends the climbing duo arrived a short time before us and we shared the summit with them. I looked at my watch and it was just after 6 AM. We spent a few minutes on top snapping some pictures and having a bit of fun. Rainier Crater with Columbia Crest just in front of us. You can see the vapor come up from the sleeping giant. Only a few more feet to go! Jason on Rainier's summit. Group Shot! I was so happy to be on the summit. I couldn't stop smiling or laughing. Tyler showing his vert. Sorry, boys...but we're only halfway! There was actually a crest near us that looked like it might be higher, so we decided to head over to it. It certainly wasn’t higher, but it wasn’t a big deal. We continued along the crater rim to where we had first set foot upon it just in time for the guided group to make it to the rim. We were greeted with calls of congratulations which we returned in earnest. It was a great feeling sharing that place with others who had trekked to the top. It also turned out that one of the guys in the climbing duo had a girlfriend being guided up. He went up to the top with her and proposed! I’m not normally a sentimental guy but that was pretty neat. Also, I want to throw out a shout to the guides and climbers who came before us who set all the fixed ropes and broke all the trail. Our summit trip was made infinitely easier and enjoyable because of it. Anyway, we knew that our journey was only half-way over. Our joke of making it to the top being mandatory was staring at us in the face. We wanted to make it down before the sun turned the snow to mush. We would have loved to stay on top longer, but we knew it was time to go. And I’ll tell you what…it certainly didn’t take long for the snow to begin to soften up. Heading down from the crater. Crevasse on the way down. They were all over the place. Please rope up. Soon we were back at the ladder crossing the crevasse. The duo had joked about us crawling across it so this time we walked across. I thought it was a unique experience so I took a shot looking straight down at my feet. We all made it safely across and headed down the steep slopes. We were above the top of Disappointment Cleaver at another snow bridge. The snow was turning soft, and my leg actually punched through the bridge. I was practically already on my belly, trying to distribute my weight across the surface. I felt safe with my guys there to anchor me though and I wormed across. It was only a few feet wide, but scary nonetheless. I took a shot into the crevasse for good measure. Jason crosses the ladder over the crevasse...this time on his feet. Tyler follows Jason over the crevasse. Here I go... Looking into the open mouth... I think we all had a little bit of anxiety about descending the cleaver but in the day it wasn’t too bad. We just took it slow and steady. It was here that I shed my jacket and had my pant vents open to their fullest. The sun was deciding to be mean, seeing as we were able to summit the mountain. The snow was getting slushy as we clipped into the fixed ropes. Tyler mentioned he thought he could ski down the side of the cleaver, and I decided I’m not ready for that yet. Anyway, we kept making our way down the fixed ropes and across the traverse at the bottom.  Going down the upper cleaver. It was scarier at night. We made it back to the fixed ropes. The snow was turning to mush. I was sweating so badly by the time we were on the traverse. It was 9 AM that we returned to camp. It was so hot that I hid in my tent. If it wasn’t for the knowledge that I would have the worst sunburn ever I’m pretty sure I would have descended the rest of the way in nothing but my harness. I was in my tent eating and drinking fluids when some of the guides made it back. They told their climbers not to lie down (and follow my bad example). I was not tired physically though and I repeat…I only wanted out of the sun.  I took this shot of a Finch at Camp Muir. It was probably the best finch ever. We packed up our camp and I found that banana from the day before. For those of you who have needed closure this whole time, I finally ate it. After my time in my tent I was rejuvenated and could once again battle the sun. It was only a short jaunt back to Camp Muir and we spent the time laughing and talking about our journey. Once in Camp Muir we were asked about our trip and we gladly recounted our journey. We removed our crampons and harnesses and headed down the Muir Snowfield. OH! How I longed for skis. We could have made it back to the trailhead in about 10 minutes with skis. As it was it took a few hours…mostly sliding on our feet and glissading every chance we got. I could feel how bad I was burned, despite all my efforts to avoid it with copious amounts of sunblock. We arrived at the visitor center at about 12:30 PM. Only 6.5 hours earlier we had been standing on the summit and the huge mountain in front of us. I kept staring up at it. And all I wanted at this point was a cookie dough blizzard and a nice shower. Both were to be attained later that day, but that is a different story! Here we are...exactly back where we started!

This is a work of fiction. All of these photos are photoshopped. All of them. It's just not real life. You can pretend like those are ""crevasses"" and ""trails"" but I know they're really just poorly executed efforts at cutting and pasting. Maybe take a graphic design class or something. http://bit.ly/12bYV7G Also, it would have been really funny if that dude's soon-to-be-fiance was one of the people to punk out after the cleaver.

What's so impressive about that? I climbed up a ladder on my roof and pushed snow off of it. I added one more element by shoveling snow. Call me when you do something impressive.

multi-day,Adventure to Boston Peak and Company,"PrologueWho: Josh Lewis and I What Climb of Sahale, Boston, Eldorado and Klawatti Peaks When The last week of August Why Well...you get the idea This trip was a long time coming for me. I had been living in Colorado for over four years and been having lots of fun climbing there. I have been working on the Centennials (Colorado top 100) which is like the Bulgers for Washington but I was always very excited to get back home and head to the North Cascades. Over the past few summers I only visited home in July and was only able to do short climbs in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Pretty hard for even me to believe that this trip was my first time to the North Cascades despite growing up in Renton. This year has so far been the best and most successful climbing years in my life spending all winter and spring in Colorado, a climb of Rainier the 4th of July Weekend, then 5 weeks in Montana before a quick trip back to Colorado. I then returned home for the rest of the year in the end of August. I quickly embarked on my first trip to the North Cascades which would include climbs of Sahale Peak, Boston Peak, Eldorado Peak and Klawatti Peak. I could hardly contain my excitement as Josh and I drove to the Cascade Pass Trailhead after I picked him up from Lynnwood. My Bulger quest had begun. Forbidden Peak sunset from Klawatti Col Day 1 - Sahale and Boston PeaksOur trip started with the long drive up the Cascade River Road. This was my first time here and Josh gave me the grand tour. Since we got to the TH around 6pm surrounded by some low clouds, we decided to just camp there and start the next morning. We organized gear and went to bed with the plan to start around 7 in the morning. By 9am we were finally ooff, after sleeping in a bit. We started up the Cascade Pass trail. This trail was pretty easy since the switchbacks were low angled but the added distance was annoying. It took us about 2 hours to get to Cascade Pass where we stashed some gear and started up the Sahale Arm Trail. Cascade Pass Panorama Since I had just come off over a year at altitude, the hiking was so easy. We made it to the base of the Sahale Glacier from Cascade Pass in less than an hour and roped up for the glacier. I was surprised how small this glacier was and we crossed it in less time than it took us to rope up. Just as we reached the far end of the glacier at about 3pm we met up with two other guys coming down who had camped at the Sahale Arm campsites. They had told us they just came off Boston Peak and we asked them how it was. When they said it wasn't that bad at all I looked at Josh and I think we thought the same thing. ""Wanna try for Boston Peak I ask"" and we were both very excited to give it a go! We got some beta from them and off we went to finish the climb of Sahale Peak. Really, it was very easy. We just climbed the talus to the summit block and scrambled around on some easy class 3 terrain until reaching the top. Now for the real fun. Boston Peak lurked across the way and the ridge traverse for the most part looked like nothing more than an easy walk. We descended some slabs off Sahale and began traversing north. We reached the low saddle in no time and passed by a nice bivy spot. Sahale Peak On the Sahale glacier Scrambling up Sahale Sahale Glacier crevasse Josh ready for the challenge View of the traverse to Boston Boston from Sahale Traversing to Boston At the low saddle We continued climbing up the ridge staying on the crest as much as possible to avoid the steep loose terrain to either side. We crossed numerous knife edge sections but they were all pretty solid. Once we got close to the false south summit we traversed right and descended off the ridge to the head of the enormous Boston Glacier. A short walk at the snow/rock contact led us to a ledge at the base of the east face of Boston Peak. The beta we had gathered said to climb 20 feet up to a second ledge and walk it to its end then begin climbing up the face ""following the line of the mountain"". So we did just that, we climbed 20 feet of loose class 2+ terrain to gain the second ledge and walked a short ways to its end. From there I started to climb, hesitant at first but then I soon realized that the east face was so perfectly ledged out that the climbing rarely even exceeded class 3. Just climb from one ledge to the next following the path of least resistance. The only class 4 move was a small 15 foot chimney near the summit. The rock was no where near as loose as I had been led to believe nor was it all that exposed due to the abundance of nice ledges. The only bad part was that some of the ledges had some ball bearing scree to be sure and avoid. Before we knew it we were on the summit and I was nearly in tears. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that Boston Peak would be Bulger number 10 for me...I thought it would be one of my last ones! Josh and I took in the joy of the moment as we were standing on one of the hardesr Bulgers at 6 in the evening with the late afternoon sun lighting all the surrounding peaks in a bright yellow and orange glow. To the west lie a sea of clouds with Forbidden Peak and Eldorado poking above and to the south Glacier Peak and the whole Ptarmigan Traverse was visible and to the East, Logan and Goode dominated the views. Forbidden Peak in a sea of clouds from Boston Peak Josh on Boston Sahale Sunset Sahale Sunset Cloud glow Mount Buckner from Boston Peak We opened the big metal Mazama Mountaineers box and looked through the book to see so few ascents of this peak. Some well known WA mountaineers in there and I was honored to put my name in the book on page 50. Only 50 pages of widely spaced signatures since 1961. That really impressed me. Since it was getting late we knew we had to get down not just to avoid getting stuck up there in the dark but to also we had to hike down the trail back to the cars. We pulled the rope out and began setting up the first rappel. There were 3 rappels back down to the top of the Boston Glacier which all went smoothly. The hike back to the Sahale Glacier was gorgeous with the late evening light. We reached the Sahale Glacier just as the sun was setting and ran down the soft snow to the trail. We briefly chatted again with the guys who gave us the beta and thanked them and off we went down the trail. We reached Cascade Pass again just as complete darkness came and a bunch of fog rolled in. We took a quick break to snack and finished the long walk down the trail. Sunset over Bonanza Peak Day 2 - Eldorado PeakDay two started with a decent sleep in and a quick reshuffle of gear. We started up the Eldorado climbing route by crossing the log over the Cascade River and slogging up the steep trail. This took hours as we had to hike through the dense forests, scramble up the long boulder field, and hike up the ridge to cross over into the next drainage to the west. We reached snow and roped up for the Eldorado Glacier. Staying right, we climbed moderate snow and got to the incredible ice cliffs formation. Ice Cliffs We continued across the long flat portion of the glacier and reached the east ridge of Eldorado sometime in the afternoon. We were also greeted with our first views of Klawatti. After stashing some gear, we continued the easy ascent to the summit of Eldorado, passing over the infamous knife edge at the top. Eldorado Peak Johannesburg Mountain Forbidden Peak Dorado Needle Eldorado Knife Edge Eldorado Summit Dorado Needle Josh on knife edge From the summit the views towards Forbidden Peak, Klawatti Peak, and Johannesburg Mountain were all absolutely fantastic. There are so many great peaks to climb in this area. We began the descent off the east ridge. I decided to avoid the knife edge going down and took the rock on the other side while Josh went down the snow. We quickly met up again and returned to our gear stash. We made good time roping up again for the long traverse we had ahead of us. Since Klawatti Peak was our next goal, we started traversing the Inspiration Glacier up high and walked below the impressive north face of Eldorado. The sun got lower and the lighting we had that evening made for some of THE most beautiful sights I have ever seen. Glacier Peak to the south had such great alpenglow I was in awe at the beauty of the area. We crossed over a sketchy snow bridge and continued down to the cool just to the SW of Klawatti Peak where a perfect camp site was flattened out on some rocks next to the glacier. Snow Bridge Enroute, we had to do a sketchy descent on steep snow to cross over a steep cornice. Upon reaching the col, it was a new high for me as it marked the best place I have ever camped surpassing my previous best camp spot I had last August in Bear Basin in the heart of the Wind Rivers of Wyoming just north of Gannett Peak. We took in the beauty of the sunset with lots of photos, set up the tent, melted water and cooked dinner. Josh got some great twilight photos of Forbidden and our tent while I cooked. Klawatti Peak Klawatti Peak Josh and Eldorado Tepeh Towers Another team Tepeh Towers Klawatti Alpenglow Glacier Peak Forbidden Peak sunset from Klawatti Col Forbidden Peak twilight with tent Klawatti Col Sunset Day 3 - Klawatti PeakWe woke early to find a great sunrise on Eldorado Peak however some high thin clouds diffused the light too much for any real good lighting. We ate breakfast and roped up for the short glacier walk on the upper end of the McCallister Glacier. The plan was to climb the north ridge of Klawatti, traverse across its west face below the Smokestack then climb a gully on the SW face to reach the summit. Let me tell you though, this is one long way around for this peak. Looking back on it, we should have just climbed straight up from where our tent was which would have saved us hours. We began scrambling up the north ridge once we got to the Klawatti/Austrera col and quickly had to negotiate some very exposed fun knife edge sections. Some good routefinding was required to keep the route at third class. We got to the point where we had to traverse the west face, which took for ever since I kept trying to stay high above the vertical cliffs at the base of the face. There is a series of good but narrow ledges you have to find to safely traverse the face and I will save you the trouble by saying, you have to descend all the way to the top of the cliffs to find the best ledges. We had to keep focused the entire time as we continually were routefinding. We were traversing 65 degree loose rock on 6-12 inch ledges with a 100 foot cliff below. It took a mental toll for sure. Once we finally traversed the west face to get around the smokestack, we found a nice rib separating some of the many gullies on the SW face and climbed solid class 2+ to class 3 to the summit. I have never been on a peak surrounded by so much glaciers except for Rainier. But this peak was different than Rainier since there was world class views and rugged peaks everywhere. In my opinion, the North Cascades are the best alpine mountaineering in all the lower 48 states and I can say that without bias ow that I have been extensively all over Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, Oregon and Washington. Eldorado sunrise Josh on the N Ridge Austrera Towers Josh traversing the W face Traversing the W face Austrera Towers Klawatti W face Klawatti SW gullies On the summit of Klawatti Peak We returned the route which took much less time now that we knew the way and quickly packed up our gear and roped up to traverse back across the Inspiration Glacier. By now a series of high clouds were blocking the sun which was nice for the glacier walk. We weaved through the big crevasses and made good time getting back to the Eldorado Glacier to which the ensuing hike out was uneventful. A half gallon of milk and Costco muffins were amazing upon reaching the Shell Station in Marblemount. AftermathTHIS TRIP WAS DA BOMB!!!! Josh told me many times he thought this area is the best in Washington state, and since I firmly believe Washington has the best alpine mountaineering, the area around Forbifdden Peak including Boston, Logan, Goode, Eldorado, Dorado Needle, and the whole Ptarmigan Traverse is likely the best in the country outside Alaska!

Diggler - Oct 2, 2012 8:08 pm - Voted 10/10 nice TR Hey Matt, while I'm not sure I agree with the (frequently used by Washingtonians) viewpoint that the N Cascades are THE best area in the lower 48 for ""alpine mountaineering/climbing,"" so much of that statement just depends on how you define that (height, amount of snow climbing, amount of mixed climbing, amount of glaciers, steepness, ruggedness, ease of access (or lack thereof, ...), that it just depends on what you mean). Regardless, they are some of the most rugged mountains I know of (& certainly some of the hardest to get to!), & a beautiful bunch for sure. Glad to read about your adventure- sounds like it was a blast! Climb safe & keep having fun! Matt Lemke - Oct 3, 2012 12:23 am - Hasn't voted Re: nice TR Diggler, Yeah I know how much goes into that statement. Everyone has a slight bias and I know both of us have spent lots of time in all of the mountains in the lower 48 so I understand there is room for different opinions. The Wind Rivers in Wyoming certainly rival anything in WA. Alpine mountaineering IMO is defined by having glaciers, ice/rock climbing, long approaches/deep wilderness, weather (or the lack of), ruggedness (ie...even mountain passes are very difficult) etc. For me elevation doesn't mean as much (unless it's over 20k feet). Thanks for commenting. I will for sure continue to have fun climbing! Sunny Buns - Oct 7, 2012 5:13 pm - Hasn't voted Nice Photos and TR Thanks for an excellent report - sounds like a fun trip.

multi-day,The Glacier Peak Epic Experience,"Introduction Wow! This trip was one of my most special trips in a long time. It had been two long years since the last time I had done a Cascade volcano and Glacier Peak was in my short list for a very long time. As some of you have known it had been two long years since I have been able to get to the larger volcanoes in the Cascades. I did get Mount Lassen back last year with my wife but this peak was basically just a hike. My year started decently by going down to southern California and Death Valley but has waxed and waned since with a couple of decent climbs such as Big Lou and Icicle Ridge and one other Bulger; that being Dragontail. But I knew that this year was not going to be a true success unless I took a shot at Glacier Peak. I often told many of my partners that if I got Glacier Peak and no other summit than this year was a great success. My friend mtn.climber decided to setup a good 4 day trip up Glacier Peak in September. I was a little out of shape and as late as July my conditioning was at its lowest point. The effort up Dragontail really woke me up to the fact that I need to get into shape and fast. Over the next two weeks I had gone at least 20 miles a week and had knocked off at least 7000 feet of elevation gain. Some my longer hikes and scrambles included Wright Mountain, Mount Roosevelt and Mount Angeles. Luckily there was very little in terms of odd weather and I was really able to kick my conditioning into overdrive. But none of these hikes would ever be able to prepare for a trip like Glacier Peak. The planning could not have gone off better and the weather forecast looked very favorable for this trip. In fact there was supposed to be no clouds in site for the entire trip. Another thing going for us is our team. All of the members on our team were very strong. Our team consisted of Fletcher, OneLuv, mtn.climber, rock n'climb, Jimbopo and me. With a well thought out trip and an excellent forecast I knew this was my best shot at Glacier Peak for a long while. Day 1: Trailhead to White Pass Sloan Peak from the trail Okay if I was going to be able to be successful in getting up to Glacier Peak I was going to have to be able to carry my 45 pound pack 9 1/2 miles and over 3500 feet of elevation to White Pass. I was also going to have to carry the pack in an unusually warm September Day. Of course it didn't help that I had not done this since January and the fact that I was going to clearly be the slowest climber of the team. But there were no excuses now for me because this trip was going to determine the success of potentially the whole climbing year. I met mtn.climber and his son Derek and the trailhead. Our other two climbers, Fletcher and Rob had already started earlier hoping to get both White Mountain and Portal Peak. The first 5 1/2 miles was a warm up to the Makinaw Shelter. This involved some ups and down and wasn't very difficult. But doing it with a heavy pack was real pain. We made it from the trailhead to the Makinaw Shelter in a little less than three hour only to take a lunch break at the shelter. Just getting to this point for me became a major sweat fest. After the break the real climb began to White Pass. This section of trail is well graded through a number of switchback but 3000 feet of elevation gain with a heavy pack for me wasn't very fun. The extra weight I had put on really had made an impact. Luckily my good friend Jimbopo stayed with me throughout the entire the grind up to camp. Views near White Pass Sloan from near White Pass Despite the slow grind up all the switchbacks we were able to make camp at White Pass by 3 pm. For me this was a great victory. During the evening many of the others went to the top of White Mountain to see the sunset. Me and mtn.climber personally wanted to go but thought better of it due to the fact that we wanted to save my strength for the main goal Glacier Peak. I was able to get some great sunset views from camp, but after watching the pictures that the others got from the summit of White Mountain, I realized that I missed out on a golden opportunity. That though was the end of the first day and that night I managed 10 hours of decent sleep. Indian Head from White Pass The sunset that I missed! :( Day 2: White Pass to Glacier Gap The ridge we had to cross After a good long sleep at White Pass, the next day we decided to head to Glacier Gap. This involved a little scrambling and off-trail work, which normally isn't much of a problem. But we all had a heavy pack on. The biggest obstacle of the trip was crossing the ridge from White Pass over to the formal remains of the White Chuck Glacier. We were honestly off route here because everyone who had attempted this peak before attempted at either higher snow years or early times. The goal-Glacier Peak We choose one gully that was done last year in the snow. This time though instead of the group being greeted with a steep snow slope we were greeted with 45 degree loose scree. Before going down the steep gully all of us put on our helmets and slowly headed down. This was another obstacle that with a normal daypack is no big deal but with a heavy pack this can be a real grind. Slowly all of us headed down the steep gully. The last 50 of it ended as snow which a number of people in our capitalized on by doing a slow glissade. A new tarn lake From there we were welcomed to wonderful world of the former White Chuck Glacier. This moonscape once served as a very large glacier as recently as the 1970's. Now the glacier has receded to mostly a scree and occasional snowfield landscape. It should be quiet interesting to find out what this place is going to look like 30-50 years from now. The former White Chuck Glacier While traveling across this moonscape we slowly traveled over what was formally the White Chuck Glacier and up past a number of lakes and steep slopes. The travel time had to be slow do to unstable scree of what we were walking on. Slowly though we were able to pick our way through the landscape all the way to Glacier Gap. Some of us camped at Glacier Gap while a couple of us camp at a sub peak just north of Glacier Gap. A number of us were thinking about attempting nearby Kololo Peak but we all agreed not to in order for us to save our energy on what was our main goal; Glacier Peak. Views from the area That night we camped out on what started out being a windy night. Jimbopo and I had to use rocks in order to solidify our tent. The wind continued throughout the evening but eventually died down during the night. Most in our group stayed up in order to see the sunset. However I was tired so I went to sleep well before 6 pm. because I knew we were going to have a huge day the next day. Day 3: Part 1: Glacier Peak summit and the backpack down to White Pass Heading to the summit At dawn all us woke up for the day that we all were looking for; the summit of Glacier Peak. We all quickly got ready and by 6 am we are starting our ascent of Glacier Peak. We made decent time rising up the southern slope of Glacier Peak passing to the east of Disappointment Peak. There were some miniature crevasses but nothing to large or dangerous. There was some minor rock fall that was coming off of Disappointment Peak so we had to keep our focus up during the traverse. Looking down the ridge The crux the Cool glacier icefall lied just ahead. This area had a number of interesting moats and crevasses and required a lot of special attention. Going up this section we all took our time in order to make sure that all of us were safely across. This section was the slowest section on our trip. We were able to make it safely across and soon were continuing our trip up Glacier Peak. Nearing the summit Soon we were in the gap between Glacier Peak and Disappointment Peak. From here it was just a 1000 foot Class 2 dirt and scree scramble to the true summit of Glacier Peak. Fletcher, Jimbopo and OneLuv charged ahead while I and mtn.climber slowly pick our route up to the summit area of Glacier Peak. The last dirt scramble was not very difficult and all of us go to the true summit by 10 am; 4 hours from Glacier Gap. Riding the summit The team The views from the summit were excellent with pretty much all of the volcanoes and well over 1000 summits within view. Many people who have climbed all the volcanoes in Washington have claimed that Glacier Peak has the best views in Washington State. From what I saw I will agree with them, though I think Rainier has the best sunrises, especially with Little Tahoma in the foreground. We spent an hour on the summit, basking in the 50 degree summit temperatures, signing the log book, bouldering on the summit rocks. We also traversed all across the summit in order to enjoy all the wonderful views that Glacier Peak has. Summit Views Summit Views Summit Views Summit Views Day 3: Part 2: Heading BackAll of celebrated in our success, but we all knew that the trip was only half way over. We still had almost 20 miles of rough backcountry in order to get back to trailhead and truly enjoy the success of the trip. So we got back and headed back down to the gap. At first the travel was slow with the loose scree. But around 500 feet down from the summit of the footing got better and all of us were able to fly into the gap. Most of us including me decided to go up the quick scramble to Disappointment Peak where more excellent views awaited. The view of Glacier Peak from this summit is very impressive. After this quick scramble we were back and on our way down the mountain. Heading down While on the glacier heading back a couple of the crevasses started to open up. We had to take our time as we were crossing the glacier. When we got to the crux of the glacier all of us took our time as we were crossing the icefall. The conditions from the heat of the day were starting to make things very interesting for us. Once through the crux the trip back became much easier. We did hear some rock fall coming from Disappointment Peak but the icefall was not very bad and we were able to make very good time back to camp. It took us a little less than three hour to make it back to camp. Careful!! On the snow Once back at camp though we had to pack up the camp and head down to White Pass. We took a little break but we knew we had little time or we would be headlamping it back to White Pass. Fletcher the quickest person in our group had to rush on back to the car because he had work early the next morning. Rob went with him all of the way back to White Pass to make sure that he made back to the place safe and sound. For me heading back was tiring. This is where my physical fitness was really starting to catch up with me. I was tired from the climb but I knew I had to hold myself together because one the hardest sections of the trip were yet to happen. On the way back over ridge separating White Pass and White Chuck Glacier we took a different way back. Fletcher and Rob were able to quickly find their way around this section and were at White Pass in 3 hours. The rest of us struggled through this section. Mtn.climber and his son Derek once on the ridge decided to find their way across by doing a very tough Class 3 rock and dirt scramble through the ridge. They made it back faster than Jimbopo and I, but had a lot more thrill. A look back at our success Jimbopo and I dropped through a gully to what we thought was a climbers trail. That trail soon faded and we did not see a safe way back so we dropped in elevation and the then traversed over until we finally rose back up the ridge to find the climbers trail again. This way was much longer than the way mtn.climber and Derek did but there were no major scrambles. At one point Jimbopo was worried that we were going to have off trail for the evening but eventually we were able to find the trail and get back to White Pass. We beat sunset and were able to setup camp just before sunset. Day 4: Back to the Trailhead The last day's sunrise The last view of White Pass Okay all we had was 9 1/2 miles left downhill and we were home free. But after the past three days we were all beat. So this last day at least for me was a really grind. I was at first able to gather decent speed as I headed down the mountain. But as the elevation lowered the valley floor began to heat up and that at this point was beginning to play games with my tired body. To make matters worse my now blistered feet and numerous heat rashes were really giving me problems. I still though made great time back to the Makinaw Shelter. But past the Makinaw Shelter I really began to slow down. I was in real pain here and the impacts of the climb were starting to get to me. The heat at this point was really affecting not only my energy but my mode. What made this worse was the fact that I had one annoying bee follow me for at least 3 miles while I was heading back to the car. But at this point I knew that I was in the home stretch and so I fought through all of my pains and finally made the trailhead around 1 pm. At that point all I could is YEAH!!!!!!!!! I have successfully climbed Glacier Peak. ConclusionThis trip could only be described as epic. It took all the mental and physical strength I had to be successful here but in the end we all did it successfully and safely. The final volcano of all the stratovolcanoes is now complete and summer is a complete success. Everything else from this point on is gravy. I got the goal I wanted and now I can focus on many more awesome climbs. Don't worry the adventures will continue. I want to thank everyone for their awesome company. Everyone here played a role in the trip's success. First of all I want to thank Dave for inviting me on this awesome climb. OneLuv we all have to thank for leading us through the most dangerous part of the crux. Fletcher and Derek were awesome climbing partners as well sticking close by and being excellent company on a great trip. I hope to climb with all of them many, many times again.

Since we didn't want to finish up on pumice (after all, it's Glacier Peak), we continued across the Cool Glacier, paralleling the crevasses, and onto the Chocolate. We climbed a steep, narrowing snow chute between two rock cleavers, popped through a keyhole between the rock tower on the left and the little bergschrund, crossed a short hog back and were on the summit snow cap. Fun climb and no dirt (once we finally made it to snow). Long day from White Pass. Viewing: 1-6 of 6 to post! Don't have an account?"
multi-day,The Jack Mountain Assault: A 4 Day Epic,"Introduction ""The one who follows the crowd will usually get no further than the crowd. The one who walks alone, is likely to find himself in places no one has ever been."" -Albert Einstein Jack Mountain is rarely ever climbed due to it's all around alpine difficulty. The Previous year Yem and I made an attempt up Jack Mountain in icy conditions. This time I came more prepared with better mountaineering skills, went in better condition, and brought my ice tool as a second axe. But it still ended up being an epic trip with many exciting moments as well as getting on the edge of my comfort level. This mountain lives up to it's reputation. It has been unusually cloudy this summer making it difficult to obtain a good weather window. When the forecast looked halfway decent, we knew that this would be the best time to make a go for Jack. Yem picked me up from my house on the morning of July 19th. On the way we enjoyed a quart of chocolate milk which is part of my mountaineering tradition. Our Route up Jack Mountain Day 1: Going into Jerry Lakes BasinWe arrive at the Canyon Creek trailhead around noon which meant that the day was already hot. The trail to ""Crater Lake"" is about 62 switch backs (we counted both on the way up and down) with about 3,900 feet of elevation gain. Crossing the creek this time was not as bad, although we still had to take our shoes off. Before arriving at the lake there were some downed trees on the trail which we had to climb over or go around. At the lake I had to go from tennis shoes to plastic boots due to the wet spots and eventually snow patches. The ending of the trail marked the beginning of the scramble up to the Jerry Glacier Saddle. There was a little bit of loose rock which is why I waited for Yem to climb up all the way until I would go up. I admit climbing in plastics isn't quite as friendly for scrambling as shoes. At the top of the scramble was a large snow patch that took us all the way to the saddle (7,200 feet). Majestic Mountain Kimtah and Cosho Peak Scrambling above the Lake Looking toward Crater Lake Going to the the Saddle Looking up at Crater Mountain Jack With Wavy Clouds Jackita Ridge during Evening Waterfalls on Crater Mountain At the saddle we could see Jack Mountain and our camping destination below. We took a break and roped up for the Jerry Glacier. The rest of the way was an easy walk down about 1,300 feet of elevation loss. As we were hiking down I could see clouds rising over Jack Mountain making it questionable whether we would make a summit bid the next day. Finally we arrive at the Jerry Lakes which after a little searching we found a flat place to camp. As I cooked dinner I enjoyed the alpenglow on Crater Mountain. After this we got some well deserved rest. Yem Heading Up Heading towards Jack Mountain Roped up for the Jerry Glacier Sunset on Crater Mountain Alpenglow on Crater Mountain Clouds before the Storm Jerry Lake Reflection Pink Sky from Camp Day 2: Waiting out the StormIn the middle of the night it started to rain which is when I had to get up and put on my pack cover to prevent it from getting soaking wet outside. Sometimes I would wake up to the booming of thunder. During the morning was when the thunder was at it's worst which we could hear it crashing though the valley. Both of us were completely unmotivated to go outside which I slept in until about 2 p.m. Our Camping Spot near the Lake The rain still continued which even the idea of advancing our base camp soon fell out of the question. Yem told me an amazing story of finding his dog in San Diego and other fun conversations as more hours pass by. Even during evening the sky was foggy making me wonder if the weather would cooperate during summit day. Even though I slept so much the previous night I still managed to sleep great that night as well. The only View we got that Day Day 3: The Summit AssaultWe woke at about 6:45 a.m. and made breakfast. Yem figured an early start would actually be a bad thing considering that on our previous attempt the icy traverse was some of the more sketchy climbing that I've ever done. We were on the move by 7:57 a.m. crossing around the Jerry Lakes. Once we were back on snow I took the lead because I was the only one with plastic boots which went though the snow like butter. And besides I love kicking in steps. The Saddle above was not as dangerous this time because of there being less snow. Once past the snow section we had to do an easy scramble section and then traverse to the saddle. At the Saddle we could barely see Jack Mountain though the clouds. Once again we had to drop down the valley and lose our beautiful elevation. As we went down there was a little bit of bushes which I kept my crampons on to make going down easier even though we were not on snow most of the time. At the bottom we finally stepped foot on Jack Mountain. Crater Mountain's Summit Crater Mountain Clearing Up Clouds over Crater Mountain Yem Scrambling Up Jack Mountain Covered in Clouds I decided to go left to stay on snow as long as possible. Good mountaineering is about taking the path of least resistance, not the most direct way. I don't mind challenges, but no sense in going though bushes when you don't have to. As we hike up though the snow Jack Mountain comes out of the clouds, our good weather window had finally arrived. We continued on past our old camping spot from last year and got onto the first major snowfield of Jack Mountain. Crater's West Face Point 7292 Waterfalls on Jack Jackita Ridge Below Jack Mountain Clearing Up The first Snowfield on Jack Mountain Yem crossing the Snowfield The snow conditions were nearly perfect. Not too soft, but easy to make steps for traversing. I was very pleased that I felt fully comfortable on this, the previous year was so icy that I dreaded every step. After traversing I went straight up the mountain towards our entrance onto the route. The tactic I used was easier because it avoids up sloping traverses. After an hour from when we entered onto the snowfield we arrived on the rocky section. Looking up Jack Mountain Going up this part was much easier using crampons on the loose rock. We curved around the corner where it starts to become class 3. I took off my plastics and swapped to shoes. There was a cairn or two that ensured that we were going the right way. After more class 3 scrambling I come across a rappel sling and start to think ""this route doesn't get any harder than class 3"". A few seconds later my attitude changed very rapidly. The route traversed across a very exposed section that required very careful use of hands. I took one picture and put my camera in my pack (I usually don't put it away on scrambles). I admit that the class 4 section made me nervous, had to carefully plan out exactly where the steps were and test the holds. The rock was loose and crumbling away, looking down I could see rocks tumbling thousands of feet down the mountain in high speed. But I managed to feel fairly comfortable on this terrain. And I know I shouldn't be! Hiking Above the First Snowfield Looking Down Below Class 3 Scrambling Once I arrived at the second rappel sling, I could look directly down on my partner which was an amazing perspective. After a little while I set down my pack and climbed down to make sure that he was doing ok with the class 4 section. Once we both arrived safely at the rappel sling we were past the crux of the climb. But we still had a ways to go. I decided to take the ridge looking route up which was usually class 2 with a few class 3 spots. Eventually it ended which Yem told me that we had to get over to the snowfield on the left. To get there we carefully traversed over and slightly downward. Then the rest of the snow climbing was upwards. This part of the climb was an amazing experience for me. Yem Climbing Across Class 4 Traverse The Ridge Up Hiking on the upper Mountain We used both axes at this part for speed and control going up the slope. Looking down was still exposed, but I didn't feel one bit nervous. I was excited as I kicked in each step saying to myself ""This is Climbing as it should be"". Yem and I joked back to each other saying random ""Touching the Void"" quotes. One of them being that ""Climbing makes you feel more alive"". The adrenaline was pumping and I knew that I was in my element. It had taken us about an hour and a half to climb the snowfield when we arrived onto the summit ridge. Looking down on my Partner The Summit Ridge Jack Mountain's West Ridge The ridge was quite pleasant, the rock was good for the most part and it was much safer than all the other climbing we did that day. Looking behind us was the West Ridge of Jack. The clouds were divided right at the ridge making it have a neat atmosphere to the place. There was one snow patch that I had Yem lead because I was in my tennis shoes. With a little more scrambling and a walk up ""The Ramp"" we arrived on the summit of Jack Mountain! On the summit I celebrated by having a pack of Oreo's with some milk (we used powdered milk). I promised Yem some which I was enjoying them so much that by the time I had only 3 left I realized I had to share. The views were quite incredible, but after about 30 minutes we had to make good time down the mountain. Nohokomeen Glacier Snowfield Peak with Clouds Snow Patch near the Top The Last few Steps Mount Logan's North Face Mount Buckner Black Peak to the South Pyrimid Peak with Clouds Cloudy Atmosphere over Forbidden Peak Looking Down the East Side A Scary DescentI had not fully realized the gravity of what we had climbed. Going up I felt fantastic, but it wasn't until we started to go down that I realized that we had a situation coming up. We quickly scrambled down the ridge and got to the snowfield where I once again swapped to my plastics. As we climbed down the snow I was amazed at what we had gone up, but I was still feeling relatively comfortable. Going down took a lot of kicking in steps and ice ace placements. It was getting late in the day making it important that I down climb as fast as I safely can. At the bottom of the snow I carefully fill up our water bottles. It was a precarious spot to place my pack, but I knew that I had no choice. I was becoming very thirsty from all the kicking steps and could start to feel cramps coming on. Forbidden Cleared Up Golden Horn and the Needles Traverse Section Light Clouds during Evening Green Scenery in the Pasayten Wilderness Mount Goode to the South From here we went slightly up and were soon off the snow. The down climbing had taken us about 2 hours. I swapped back to my shoes fast (every time I did this, to save time I kept the crampons and gators attached and put it in my pack) and was back to scrambling down. Every now and then one of us would send a rock down which we had to be careful about how we were in position of each other. I was surprised how fast we managed to get down to the second rappel sling. This is where things got scary. Scrambling Down We got the rope ready and put it though the rappel ring, my biggest worry came true. It didn't reach. Looking down I dreaded the idea of having to get off the rope and down climb the last section. I knew that if there was anyone to go down first, it would have to be me. Looking around I said aloud ""there's gotta be another way"". We both knew there wasn't. This was the only way down. The rappel position was the worst I've ever seen. The people who put up the webbing couldn't have done much to fix this. With the slightest tug the webbing moved which worried me. We secured it on as best as we could. I said a prayer and got on with the rappel. To start out I had to go over to the right where there was a minor ledge. With one hand I held on to the brake and the other I held the rock. I had to traverse more towards the webbing to get it in motion. But as I got closer it became increasingly more over hang like. My arms were exhausted from the climbing and were starting to give way. I could not figure out a safe position to get to. If I fell, I could majorly swing and pull the sling in a bad direction. I was starting to shake from how scary it was and how strenuous it was. I was getting so tired that I couldn't grip my brake. If I fell it would be fatal. I was terrified. I was almost to the point of tears wondering what I could do. Yem could see that I was not having a good time and finally said ""I'm going to have to ask you to take a leap of faith"". My heart was pounding, I was trembling, but I knew that I could no longer stand idle. As hard as I could, as careful as possible I managed to brake in a awkward position and I fell back. The rock held and I continued to rappel down. I was breathing so heavy by this point, when I reached the bottom I was still breathing heavily in disbelief of what just happened. But we still were not down. I unclipped my device and looked for a way down. I made sure the ropes were even and called up that the rappel was as good as it can be. I suddenly heard the whistle of a rock coming right by me shattering into pieces and sailing down the mountain. I immediately hurried to an overhang spot, ducted my head, and hoped that I wouldn't get pelted by a rock. I heard more coming down as I waited on my insecure spot. One foot was being held up by a small hold, while the other I felt slowly sliding down. I was still terrified. As I look over I see the mountains glowing gloriously with orange and red colors. Normally I can take photographs on ledges and strange place, but not this time. Finally Yem arrives down which we had two options for going down. Both of them looked bad. After making careful observations one of them looked outright awful and would be a serious mistake. The one on our right however was possible but not pleasant. Yem came up with a fabulous idea of girth hitching a sling to another sling to the rope. This would give me just enough length to get to the class 4 section. I carefully down climbed this section and on to the class 4 section. Yem mentioned the idea of leaving my rope, he could tell right away that although I might say yes, he knew I might possibly go back for it. So he saved my rope by soloing that section which I very much appreciated. Epicing on the Side of the MountainThe sun had already set which we now had to make best of the remaining day light left. We some what quickly scrambled down the class 3 section and around the corner came back to the snowfield. Going up this class 2 section with crampons was much easier than hiking down in shoes because of the loose rock. I swapped back to boots and we got our headlamps out. It was back to kicking steps and ice axe plunging. By now it was officially night. The snow was solidifying making every step and axe placement more difficult than coming up. Eventually we reach the bottom and can faintly make out our tracks. The sun melted out our steps for the most part making it hard to see where exactly they were. I told Yem ""When you get to my house, you can have all you can eat ice cream"". It took a while to cross the snowfield which once we were on the other side I could finally start having thoughts ""I think I'm gonna make it out alive""! When we got onto the rock it was hard to make out exactly where we were. ""I can't see Jack's eastern high point"" I said to Yem which was a sign of us not traversing enough. I kept my crampons on because I was too tired to bother with them, plus they helped with the scree. We had a rigged idea of where we were, but could not find enough evidence of places we been. So we decided to go to the snow and find the bowl which would lead us back to our tracks. ""Found the trail"" I said with a smile. A few minutes later I announced ""lost the trail"". Our route up went to the right of where we were, but unfortunately we turned too early. It was steep down below as we traversed on snow. Finally it was time to turn around and back track. Back at our newer tracks we cut right though the bushes. Yem mentioned ""You don't mind if we sleep here on the mountain?"". At first I didn't like the idea which we did a little more exploring and found a creek. With it was two okay spots to sleep on. ""I admit, I'm pretty beat myself"" I said. So I approved of the idea and filled up our waters. Unfortunately I had forgotten my shell pants back at camp which I only had shorts for my legs. Yem had some thin long johns he let me borrow. Camp was still a long ways away, and if we were to have tried it we had a bit of elevation gain as well. Oh how I wished that my -20 degree bag that was at camp was with me. I managed to get perhaps 3-4 hours of sleep that night. But every time I woke up I felt very cold and was shivering. Those parts of the night felt very long. I felt so thirsty yet I did not want to move and lose heat. During the early light hours Yem and I were not getting anymore sleep which we were both shivering. Finally we got up, and started the hike down. Day 4: The Long Haul HomeWe did a little bit of traveling though bushes but were down at the bottom in decent time. Looking behind us I could see steams of clouds coming in which I figured meant a storm. We hiked back up to the saddle in about an hour and was able to see our camp down below. Carefully we hiked down to the lake and back to camp. After a good breakfast I took a half hour nap. Yem woke me up and said we had to go. All sorts of mosquitoes were buzzing around the tent. I felt unmotivated to go outside, but knew the sooner we got out, the better. As I packed my gear I had to keep circling the camp to reduce the chances of getting bit. This made packing take longer. The mosquitoes were getting quite bad which is why I was happy to leave the camp spot. Alpenglow on Jack Mountain Sunrise to the South Streaming Clouds The View above Jerry Lakes Jack Mountain during Morning Slowly we slog up hill toward the Jerry Glacier. By the time we arrive the clouds had fully come in making it low visibility. I had Yem lead this part because my legs were tired from all the snow kicking the previous day. Hiking though the fog we missed the saddle. Fortunately it clears for a short spell and we see the way we need to go. At the edge of the glacier we unrope and take a short break. Where are we? Clearing in the Fog Looking Above at the Saddle Our Exit Out Looking Down Crater Waterfalls near the Lake Marsh Marigold Flowers Camp Spot near the Lake The rest of the way down was easier going with good visibility. With a little bit of navigation and staying to the left we arrive at ""Crater Lake"". Before long were on the 62 switch back trail making great time. After hiking down for a while we arrive at the trailhead. As compensation for kicking in steps Yem buys me dinner at Marblemount which I was very pleased. And of course I had to get chocolate milk for the way home. This was a very exciting trip with many experiences on the way. Anyone climbing this mountain I urge you to know that it takes years of mountaineering and is quite an under taking. I want to thank my partner Yem for his research, driving, and good company on this trip. This trip filled my adventure cup for a while, most mountains don't even come close.

Doable, but much harder than Rainier. I had minor cramps on the way down which I had to be careful of how I kicked in the steps. Fortunately we found flowing water which I was able to recover.

Aaron Dyer - Aug 16, 2012 7:42 pm - Hasn't voted rock quality your account on the bad rock and scary class 4 brought back too vivid memories of a similar experience on nearby Sentinel Peak. We went up a 3rd class that led to 4th class gulley and it became apparent as the rock transitioned from typical cascade loose to compacted dirt gravel that we were not going down the same way. We had left our packs lower, had no rope, and did not know if there was another way off it. Gotta love the committed feeling! We too were not uncomfortable on that terrain, as you noted. It's because you can't afford to be nervous: that kills you. Viewing: 1-20 of 25 12 to post! Don't have an account?"
multi-day,Three Volcanoes And A Rock,"On The Summit Of South Sister Part of the deal I struck with my boss that enabled me to take time off for the Greece and Egypt trip this Spring was to work a promotional gig in Oregon in the middle of July. Bummer! During the height of mountaineering season, on one of the best weekends, I would be stuck working. But then I started thinking about the volcanoes. My counter offer to my boss was to get a company vehicle and a couple of extra days to get back to Washington after the work was done. He accepted. Paulina Peak Overlook Each day I worked I would stare at the three sisters which were visible from the parking lot. After getting off early from my position one afternoon I snuck over to check out Paulina Peak (7985) and Newberry Crater which has a couple lakes and a huge obsidian flow. It was really just a drive up to the rim of an old volcanic crater, but at least it got me over 7000 feet. Lewis Glacier Runoff Pool Lewis Glacier Runoff Pool Then finally the weekend ended. My friend Robbin drove down from Washington to meet me that evening and we went to the trailhead for South Sister (10,358 feet) which is the highest in the Three Sisters Wilderness. We got an early start the next morning and made good time on the south ridge. We passed a small lake at the base of the Lewis Glacier and from there it wasn't far to the summit. On top we had views of the other volcanoes to the north including Middle Sister (10,056 feet), North Sister (10,085 feet), Three Fingered Jack (7841 feet), Mount Jefferson (10,497 feet), and Mount Hood (11,239 feet). We descend quickly making good time even though I took us a little off route. Nearing The Summit Mount Bachelor Visible Near The Summit We had planned to do Mount Bachelor (9065 feet) the next day but there was plenty of daylight left and we were both feeling good so we decided to go for it. We followed the ski lifts on the north ridge and once again made good time getting to the summit although we were both feeling a little tired after 7600 feet of gain. On the summit we met a man from Florida that was also in town for business. His exuberance for being in such an amazing place was contagious. We felt sorry for him living in such a flat place. Mount Bachelor Mount Hood Seen From The Parking Lot We sat on the summit for about a half hour talking, laughing and just being happy to be alive. We bid our friend farewell and turned back to the north ridge. Snow conditions were perfect and I was able to do a standing glissade that lasted for (((2000 FEET))). As my friends know, I love standing glissades and this was the best one to date. We came down 2000 feet in about 18 minutes. Back at the car, there was still plenty of daylight left. I looked at Robbin and half-joking asked her which one we were going to do next. Even if we had wanted to, I was all out of beta so that would have to do. High Rock Lookout On The Summit We agreed to drive north and spend the night in the parking lot at the Mount Hood ski area, so we could admire an even bigger volcano. I've slept there before and even thought I pitched my tent between cars, nobody bothered us. The next morning I was able to get reception on my internet phone so I looked up the information for High Rock (5685 feet). Got it, bingo! Time for one last hurrah before going home. The trail to High Rock was short and easy so I convinced Robbin not to carry her pack. We just put some snacks in our pockets and went up. High Rock is inside the triangle of big volcanoes. From the lookout we could see Mount Saint Helens (8365 feet), Mount Adams (12,276 feet), and Mount Rainier (14,411 feet). We were closest to Mount Rainier. The view of Washington's highest volcano, just a handful of hours after seeing Oregon's highest, was just as impressive if not more so.

single-day,Injury On North Twin,"Sustained good weather, finally! It was going to be a big weekend. North Twin on Friday, the south buttress of Cutthroat on Saturday, and Big Kangaroo on Sunday. Natasha (Summitpost member seabadge) and I left the house at 4am Friday morning, the car loaded with gear and food. Little did we know, our plans for the weekend would be changing. Natasha and I prepared for the 7 mile bicycle approach North Twin seen from the bicycle approach We reached the gated logging road at 6am and found that it was open. We were tempted to drive through it rather than bike the 7 miles each way, but we didn't want to come back to a locked gate and get stuck. I fought the monotony of logging roads by seeing if I could ride all the way to the North Twin spur road without pushing the bike up the steeper parts. I was successful in that little game despite the 2300 feet of elevation gain. After hiding the bikes in the bushes, we followed the spur road to the subsequent boot path which terminates in class 2 terrain at which point the west ridge narrows. Class 2 interspersed with class 3 moves quickly turned into solid 3 scrambling. Olivine rock is the most grippy stuff I have ever set my hands on. Good holds seem hand-crafted and just about everywhere. This is what makes the Twin Sisters range my favorite scramble playground, this being my fourth trip to the area. We used mechanics gloves to protect against the rough sticky rock. gimpilator route finding As with the South Twin, difficulties on or near the crest can be avoided by traverse-scrambling slightly lower on the south face. Natasha joked around by faking tough bouldering moves on the easy terrain while I recorded numerous short clips for a video montage. Occasional cairns hinted at the route as we followed exposed ledges and crossed numerous ribs and gullies high on the south face. Eventually we came to an obvious end to the lower traverse options. What appeared in front of us was a drop-off. It was time to go straight up, back to the ridge crest. Traverse Scrambling Staying Close There were several possible lines. All appeared to be a mix of class 3 and class 4. We picked what looked like the easiest and made adjustments as we climbed. We passed several more small cairns, somewhat encouraging. Natasha asked me if she should stay further back in the gullies in case of rock fall. My reply was that sometimes it's better to stay close behind, so that if a rock gets going, it doesn't have time to build up speed. Overall the rock was very solid but a few loose pieces were present in the gullies. She stayed close behind and I was careful not to dislodge anything when I was leading. Exposed Scrambling I was just mentally congratulating myself for not sending any rocks down, when I heard Natasha yell out in pain. I turned around and she said, ""I just broke my finger"". What!?! She was in the middle of a class 4 section which looked precarious from my vantage right above her. ""I think I broke my finger, I really need to get through this tough spot"". She struggled to get through the difficult move without the use of her left hand. Eventually she made it through and rested on a small ledge next to me. She told me that I had dislodged a fist-sized rock and that it had fallen just 4 feet and landed squarely on her left index finger. Damn it! I felt terribly guilty and also worried about how we were going to get her off the mountain safely if she couldn't even use her left hand. Scrambling back down the west ridge would be impossible for her. There was only one option. We would have to descend the very steep snow slope on the north ridge. Thankfully we had the gear for it. But if a fall occurred, would she be able to arrest it without a strong left-handed grip? I knew the snow on the north ridge was extremely steep at the top and accidents have happened there before. Better not to think of such things. The crux section of the west ridge route First things first. We had to finish this present route before we could even reach the north ridge snow slope. Natasha was temped to take the glove off immediately and examine the damage. I thought it was a bad idea and said so. I didn't want the sight to freak her out, and furthermore we needed to finish this exposed scrambling before the swelling got worse. In my estimates, we were only a few hundred feet below the summit. I offered to let her lead at her own pace and without any more rockfall danger, but she preferred to follow me. Natasha fought through the pain and made it to the top. We found a spot out of the wind and gingerly removed her glove. The finger was ruptured, split open from the nail to the second knuckle. On the under side, a sliver of bone appeared to be protruding from a small hole. A compound fracture? I could also see signs of some internal bleeding. There was another hole at the tip of her finger where blood had actually exploded out from the pressure of impact. I gently wrapped the finger in gauze and then gingerly helped her put the glove back on, for some minor protection. On the summit, She took it better than I did Preparing to descend We didn't waste anymore time. We put our crampons on and got the axes out. She would now have to downclimb the north ridge snow slope facing-in. There were no other options. I led down, double-kicking each step to make sure they were bucket deep and secure for her. She did amazingly well on the descent. She said that the cold from the snow was actually helping her hand. After descending 300 feet, the slope lessened and we were able to turn around and face out which made for faster progress. Downclimbing Steep Snow Traversing down and to the left was not easy for her since she couldn't hold the ax in her left hand. After some struggling, we came back to the boot path and then finally the spur road. At the main logging road we decided to trade bikes because the brake lever on my bike is easier to squeeze than hers. It took us another 25 minutes to ride 7 miles downhill back down to the car. Our round-trip time was 12.5 hours. I drove quickly to the emergency room. The doctor had to cut the glove off because of major swelling and dried blood which was like glue. An x-ray revealed a fracture, but what had appeared to be exposed bone was merely soft-tissue poking through. Thank goodness it's not a compound-fracture, I thought to myself! We were both very relieved about that. They cleaned the wounds with an iodine soak, trimmed off the dead skin, and then wrapped it all up. She was given a script for Vicodin and Doxycycline, but she opted not to fill those since we already have doxy left over from our recent Nepal trip, and as for pain, she would rather just take ibuprofen. Throughout the whole ordeal I was amazed by Natasha's good attitude, despite her suffering. I wondered if I could have handled the situation as smoothly if it was me in her shoes. Probably not. Internal Bleeding The rupture-split after trimming In hindsight I think of how many times I've been hit by rocks that were fist-sized or bigger. All I've ever gotten were bruises. Could we have done something differently?  Perhaps there would have been less rockfall danger if we'd stayed on the crest of the ridge.  This incident has made me think again about the dangers of mountaineering and I have had to take stock on what is most important to me. What would we have done if the rock was bigger, or the injury more serious? What if she hadn't been able to downclimb from the summit? These thoughts give me pause and I don't have all the answers. Are we going to stop climbing after this incident? Absolutely not. Will we always do what we can to minimize the risk? Absolutely. Broken finger on the summit Hospital Bandages It has been several months now since the injury took place. Natasha's finger is completely healed, albeit with scar tissue. And so we have traded places, for it is I who am currently injured and cannot climb. Just as soon as she was able again, I took a fall in the mountains and tore something inside my shoulder. It's strange how sometimes in life, you experience a situation from a different point of view, and relive something though another perspective.

But, it sounds like both of you handled the situation like champions. I used to take my wife, not a climber but she used to be a scrambler, on 3rd class routes. I always took a 40 foot section of 7 mm rope and a couple of 1"" tubular slings for the parts I wasn't sure about. That short piece of rope came in handy only a couple times, but I always felt better having it with me. gimpilator - Sep 18, 2013 2:00 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Great report! Thanks Marc!

multi-day,The Art of Mountaineering: A Series of Great Climbs,"Introduction ""All good things come by grace. And grace comes by art, and art does not come easy."" -A River Runs Through It It had been a long time since Gimpilator and I went on a climb together. We were invited to climb Fortress and Chiwawa Mountain with some folks from nwhikers, but before that we wanted to climb Ruth Mountain. Fortunately we got more than we bargained for with great success. On August 3rd Art drove us to Mount Vernon to meet up with Joe for the climb. The night before the trip we negotiated the gear supply of what to carry and figuring out the route. After spending over 100$ during the month of July on my mountaineering trips I was low on cash and had to go on cheap food like donuts, peanut butter sandwiches, and other goodies. Day 1: A Beautiful Day on Ruth MountainWe left for the trailhead at about 4:30 a.m. early in the morning and got to the trailhead around 6:30 a.m. It was a beautiful clear day, with conditions 100% in our favor. The hike started out down in the valley nice and cool but with high humidity. Gimpilator Hiking through the Valley Stream Above Wet Tiger Lillie Along the way there were a few minor creek crossings with snow bridges covering them up which for me required a few tricky moves to get over. Behind me I could hear Joe yelling out to me, but I could not understand what he was saying because he was distant. It turns out he was trying to warn me about a bear that was 15 feet away from me that I had no clue that it was there. Near Hannegan Pass I changed from my approach shoes to my boots and left Joe's bamboo stick near the trail which I had used to climb over tricky spots and use to reduce spider webs in my face. At Hannegan Pass the sun finally rises above the mountains which from here we ascend the lower slopes of Ruth Mountain. Along the way we see many of the famous peaks in the area including Mount Baker, Mount Shuksan, Hannegan Peak, and the Picket Range. Mount Shuksan's North Face Hiking up on the Lower Edge of Ruth Mountain Ruth Mountain with Mount Shuksan Snow Patterns Mount Baker's East Face Hannegan Peak Goat Peak Neat Lighting near By Tomyhoi Peak After traversing around the North Arm of Ruth Mountain we soon decide that its time to rope up considering that we could not see where the glacier starts because of the heavy snow pack this year. As usual, I got to be in lead position of the rope team which I enjoy doing. Ascending Ruth was a lot easier than I had originally thought, either its a easy summit or I been climbing a lot of mountains these days. But none the less very enjoyable with a nice ridge ending. Climbing up the Ridge Excited to Reach the Summit The Summit Ridge The Picket Range Butterfly on the Summit Mox Spires to the North Looking Down towards Icy Flowers on the Summit On the summit we enjoyed a great vista of the Western Part of the North Cascades. To the South there was much cloud build up, fortunately for us we happen to be at the right area at the right time. After spending around a half hour on the summit we had to head down for our next climb the following day. Summit Panorama Nooksack Glacier Panorama The descent was pretty easy with some mini standing glissades and with firm snow. After passing down past Hannegan Pass we came to the spot where I left my shoes which Joe discovered that his bamboo stick had been stolen. Joe was not a happy camper, which he went running up the trail to find who ever took it. After 20 minutes of searching he finally had to call it quits. Who ever stole it, not cool of you to have done that. Heading Down Ruth Mountain Ruth Mountain from Below Shiny Tiger Lillies Sefrit with Flowers On the way down the mountain my ankles were starting to hurt from all the climbing that I had been doing, plus the fact that I was wearing tennis shoes down the mountain. As we were crossing one of the creeks there was a bit of a move you had to do, as I walked over onto a rock I did not see that it was slippery. Suddenly I slipped on it and fell right into the creek. When I fell I hit my knee a bit hard which for a few seconds I was unable to move, fortunately Joe rushed to the scene and helped pull me out while I was getting a bit wet. Fortunately nothing major, although a interesting moment of the trip. We took it a little easier on the way down which before I knew it, we were back at the trail head. We then went to Gimpilator's house for the next round of adventure. Day 2: Hiking into the Fortress MeadowsGimpilator had me stay the night at his house which I had watched the movie ""180 Degrees South"" which was a amazing documentary about a adventure to Patagonia. The next day we left late in the day to avoid the hot weather. It was near sunset when we started hiking the trail to Fortress basin. As we hiked up the valley it became dark with lots of mud at a few places. At the basin we met up with a few people from nwhikers near the big creek of the basin. This was the most mellow day of the trip. Before going to bed I looked out at the stars, amazed to see to many and how I could see where I was without a flash light. Day 3: Climbing Fortress and ChiwawaIn the morning I woke up to a pounding noise right next to me, I look over and see a deer running in a field of meadows. Then I see 30 or so mosquitoes on the bivy sack I was sleeping in. Fortunately non of them were able to bite me, but it was a little intimidating knowing once I get up I would have to deal with a bunch of them. We all woke up around the same time, which we started the usual breakfast making. I could finally see that we were in a beautiful meadow with many deer running around in the flowers. Chiwawa Mountain from the Meadows Camping in the Meadows Deer Walking in the Meadows Deer on the Move Enjoying the Food Here After packing up all our gear we were instantly met with one of the more interesting parts of the trip. Crossing the Creek. Lucky for us Gimpilator had brought his flip flops which I used to cross the creek. Then Gimpilator would attach it to a ski poll and throw it back over for the other partners. Unfortunately as one of our partners were crossing they dropped one of there boots which was already starting to drift away. I immediately walked in after it catching it just in time. Crossing the Creek Hiking the rest of the meadow was a easy walk through swampy like lands. From here we then started ascending up Fortress Mountain while aiming for the gully. Before the gully we had a bit of a scramble section that we had to climb over, I eventually had to bail off of it due to the crack being too muddy. Fortress Meadows Crossing another Creek Fortress Mountain Reflection Fortress Meadows Ascending up towards the gully From here we traversed over and to our surprise were right at the gully. I went straight up the snow slope while everyone else took the moat route. In the Moat After the moat we came up into the basin which we climbed up a few thousand feet of minor switch backing and traveling on snow. Hiking Up Fortress Mountain As we got towards the East Ridge one of our partners was not feeling so great about the idea of the steep snow, so they stayed back on a rock and waited for us as we climbed on. After a few hundred feet of semi steep snow climbing we were now one the east ridge. Gimpilator going onto the East Ridge Glacier Peak from Fortress We had to take it slow here due to steep and exposed slopes as well as loose rock. The ridge got quite interesting in a few spots, although manageable if one is careful. I agree with Gimpilator's opinion that the ridge was class 3 with a move or 2 of class 4. Near the end I was amazed at how the summit ending was so snowy, yet still traversable. So we all carefully traversed it, which there was one move one of our partners did not feel comfortable doing, but with Gimpilator's encouragement they managed to make it to the summit. Climbing to the Summit of Fortress Summit 360 View Copper, Fernow, Seven Fingered, and Maude This was perhaps the best view of Glacier Peak I have ever had. In the distance we could see clouds coming in which were coming at us at a rapid pace. After being on the summit for around 20 minutes we started the descent. Walking along the Ridge Down Climbing Going down was easier than I had expected, we made it down to our partner in decent time. From here we traversed down towards the Chiwawa Mountain col. As we get near the bottom we realize that Gimpilator was waiting behind with someone else because they did not feel comfortable with semi icy slopes. Gimpilator Glissading Down Peaks to the South Kolos Peaks Heading Down Fortress Mountain So in a sense this was the beginning of our group splitting into two separate groups. From here I take lead breaking in steps up the snow slopes of Chiwawa. Rather than going at a monotonous casual pace up the mountain, I decided to try something new. My technique was to climb up 30-50 feet at a rapid pace, and then take a break until everyone caught up. It was a more thrilling way to climb a mountain. As we climb up we started to wonder if Gimpilator was going to attempt this. To our surprise a while later we saw him running up the mountain which we now knew he would too make it. Looking Up Chiwawa Mountain Silence on the Mountain After getting off the snow I looked up and could see that a group of climbers were now near by us. We climbed on for another minute until suddenly one of the climbers above lost his footing. He immediately planted in his ice axe which seemed to do nothing. Sailing down the mountain he gained speed very rapidly, which by now everyone was watching. As I watched I slowly walked towards the direction in which he was falling. He slammed into the rocks which flipped him over onto his back and he rolled over and then was falling once again. Almost as if helpless he was flying down the mountain in full motion. My heart was pumping at this moment, we were all held in suspense. I then dashed for the spot that he was about to land into to help at least lower the impact. I made a grab for him which of course I was not able to stop him but I believe I managed to help slow him down. He then slid past me which I wish there was more I could do. Fortunately he fell onto a less sloped rock pile near by and managed to completely stop his fall. Immediately people were rushing to him, which my friend Gimpilator was one of the first people who spoke to him. ""I'm certified in first aid responder, what is your name"" which he went through a series of questions. Amazingly he had no serious injuries, mostly a few scrapes and such on his arm. He was wearing a helmet with a long sleeve shirt and pants which seemed kinda thick. One of my partners than had a word with me ""Josh! That was stupid of you to have done that. You put your self at risk and could have gotten hurt."" The words of criticism did not change my mind one bit. When someone is in trouble, especially when they are helpless and there is something I can do, I will not stand around and wait for anything bad to happen. Now obviously I didn't jump completely in the way, but I knew I could help, which I have no regrets to what I did that day. In the past I've had situations where my mom was falling down a ice field below Headlee Pass, and I jumped in the way which stopped her from continuing to fall down. Everyone on the mountain was silent by this point, when ever I spoke one of our group members said I should wait awhile before anyone would want to talk again. The group dynamics fell apart for a while, for a temporary period of the trip I was separated from everyone. As we climbed up I could see the section which he fell at, the snow looked a bit loose which had us worried. Matt, Joe and I decided that it would be best to try out the rock section to the right. This turned out to be a fun/ dangerous decision. The rock scramble started out class 3 and then went into class 4 terrain. Looking down below I realized that this was more dangerous than anything previous we had done the entire day. But it was too late to bail on the route, I hate to admit it but despite the danger I was still having fun on the route. After the rock section it was a couple hundred feet of walking on rock until we finally reached the summit of Chiwawa. Bonanza Peak Looking Down North Phelps Ridge Below Purple Flower on the Summit Glacier Peak with Clouds Fortress Mountain with Clouds We did not stay long on the summit because it was getting late in the day and our group had completely fallen apart by this point. After walking for a little bit I managed to find Matt and Joe while one of our other partners was way down below. We carefully then scrambled down the mountain until the terrain became friendlier again. Looking Down Chiwawa The Upper Slope Mountain to the South Looking Towards Buck Mountain Gimpilator and Maria were separated from us which we did not see until we got back to base camp many hours later. To speed things up on the way down I got a few nice glissades as well as some standing glissades. It was interesting to look above and see that the cloud deck boundary was literally above Fortress Mountain. The foot prints from earlier on were already melted away from the heat of the day, so we decided to go down what looked like a quick easy gully. ""Looks like we will be back to camp in a little more than a hour"" Matt said excitedly as we rapidly lost elevation. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Heading Down Chiwawa Alpenglow on the Ridge Red Mountain with Maude The Moon Above the Ridge After ascending off the last snowfield the slope then suddenly got steeper until it dropped off. Looking all around I instantly realized that we were completely surrounded by cliff bands. We did not want to go all the way up so we went up a little ways and tried different gullies. This turned out to be a bit of a adventurous part of the trip. By this point we were all quite tired and the sun had already set which meant that day light was very limited. It just so happen that there was a solar flare that day, even though my partners had gps's, they were not accurate. ""The gps says we are on our tracks"" announced Tom knowing that we were far from our original way up. Pink Sky from Fortress Red Mountain during Evening Clouds Coming over It was starting to get dark, so we had to make a decision fast, and of course make sure it would be the right one. So ultimately we decided to go all the way back up the gully and traverse the lower portion of Fortress Mountain and go onto the edge of the south ridge. This turned out to be the way, although with a few minor complications. I then finally decided to put on my crampons as we traveled down the gully we had come up. After down climbing the gully we were back into trees, we decided against taking off our crampons due to the muddy steep terrain we were in. As we went further down we missed the creek crossing spot, which we then followed it a ways down in the dark until we got to a safe crossing. Near the meadows there were many fallen over trees on the edge of the mountain, it's amazing how far avalanches go down in the snowy seasons. As were walking though the woods we see fresh foot prints. Camp was now close at hand, and before long we were at the creek crossing. Everyone but me crossed with there boots on, I figured Gimpilator was still in the mood for Red Mountain the next day which is why I preserved them. After a cold crossing I got to enjoy some warm food and some well deserved rest. Day 4: Hiking up Red MountainIn the morning we packed up our gear and got ready for Red Mountain. For the next many miles it was a nice walk through the forest on trail and old road. Once we were about half way up Red Mountain Gimpilator decided for us to go straight up the side of the South Eastern slope. This turned out to be a nice and easy scramble. The Trail to Red Mountain Blue Ridges to the South Fortress Mountain The Route up Red Mountain We took it easy hiking up the slope, one of our partners was not pleased with all the loose rock on the mountain. Soon we were on the summit ridge. Red Mountain's Summit Ridge Bonanza Peak To the summit it was a safe and sun scramble up and over along the ridge. According to Gimpilator, he considers it to be the best views of the area in comparison to what we did previously during the trip. Phelps Ridge, Bonanza, and Dumbell Mountain Glacier Peak Panorama Red Mountain Panorama Soon after we made a speedy descent down the mountain. Once we got back to the road I was able to wear my approach shoes once again which was nice. We had some great talks on the way down. Heading Down Sunset from the Valley Sunset on Buck Mountain It was quite nice getting to the car, finally I was able to once more get a drink of water. Once again I was pleased to have gone on more great adventures in the mountains.

multi-day,Old Men and the Kautz,"Mt Rainier - Kautz Glacier Route This photo shows the different approaches or descent route we used. Kautz Glacier - Mt RainierFrank, Mike and I attempted to do this route as a two day trip in 2003 but 500 miles of driving, a late start and 9000 vertical feet of climbing proved to be too much for the three of us. Even though we had perfect weather and snow conditions, the trip was a non-stop 3 day grind and frankly, not much fun. We came back in 2004 with a new plan where we would stay one night on the cleaver (9000') below the Turtle snow field and the next night below Camp Hazard (11,300') giving us a rest day before we went for the summit. We also had the time to find the slot and the short rappel into the gully that leads to the ice cliff and onto the Kautz. We took off from our camp at 12:30 AM and climbed solo by headlamp until daybreak came as we were just below the crest. At 6:45 AM we were on the summit. We hung around for at least an hour as the sun warmed things up and then down climbed the route. We spent one more night below Camp Hazard and descended in the early morning when things were relatively quiet. As we descended the Wilson Glacier we heard a lot of water running under the snow and in the distance, a waterfall. Frank suggested that we avoid the fan and descend across the Wilson to the Nisqually. We were familiar with the route across the Nisqually from our previous trip on a low snow year and didn't think much about the decision. After jumping a crevasse and plunge stepping down a relatively clean stretch of the Wilson, we came to a maze of crevasses that were running in several directions and it looked like we were going to have to re-climb the 500' we had just come down. Mike and I were resigned to the fact that we had just screwed up when Frank announced that he had spotted a solid snow bridge that appeared to lead through the maze. He called for a belay so we dropped our packs and got ready to set some anchors. As Mike and I came down closer I could see that the bridge was solid but it had what appeared to be a 150' overhanging left side and a 50' drop on the right. I shouted to Frank, ""that sucker looks like it's 150' deep."" Ever the geology professor, Frank said ""umm..., they are rarely over 140' deep due to the compressive forces at the bottom of a glacier"". Under my breath I said, ""WTF, it looks like you fall, you die"". The crevasse crossing was both terrifying and stunningly beautiful at the same time. The ice was aquamarine to deep blue, unlike any colors I had seen on this earth but the bottom was as black as a coal mine. The bridge itself couldn't have been wider than 3 feet and it was maybe 30' to get across the narrowest section but what a walk it was. We went across quickly, one at a time only to find that it led to more ice cliffs. Once again, Frank spotted a line and with the temperature warming up it was time to get off this glacier. We zig-zagged down the ice fall on more bridges and finally got out to the relatively flat section of the Nisqually where we took a break. Just as we dropped our packs we heard a crack and rumble only to look up and see a large serac crash exactly where we had walked 30 minutes earlier. It was a great relief when we finally walked off the Nisqually and back to the trail. We were very fortunate to have the luxury of timing our trip to be able to climb in perfect weather and snow conditions. We started up the mountain just as a front moved out and high pressure was building. We had clear skies and freezing temperatures for all three nights making for great snow conditions and little activity from the cliff. For me and Mike, it took 4 trips to get a weather window like this. We had been blasted off this mountain many times in the past so this trip was magic.

I swore off going to Rainier in the early season after being snowed off 4 different times in the month of June. Around July, we usually get a big high pressure ridge that builds up over the western U.S. that produces days and even weeks of clear weather. Having been beat down and whipped before, we didn't leave for Washington until we saw a good weather trend developing. Viewing: 1-2 of 2 to post! Don't have an account?"
single-day,The Armstrong Summit Troll,"The Armstrong Summit TrollOn the summit of 4600-ft Armstrong Mountain in the Okanogan Mountains of Washington State lives a troll. This particular troll is a pretty emotionless creature. You might say he is stone-faced all of the time. His will is as strong as granite. He is granite. One can drive rather easily with a high-clearance 2WD to the summit of Armstrong Mountain on the Colville Indian Reservation. It’s about four or five dirt miles off the highway. At the summit is a very tall steel lookout tower built some 50 years ago. The tower is now abandoned and the compartment at the top no longer has a roof. The tower does not sit right on the summit. It’s pretty close. But not quite. Why doesn’t it sit on the summit? Because that’s where the summit troll sits… In June 2010 Stefan Feller and I visited the summit at the end of a trip out that way. It was getting late and it was raining. We saw the troll in the woods and were scared off. I vowed to return with weaponry, if needed. In July 2011 Jerry Daniels and I returned with weapons enough to slay the troll. Or at least smite it into submission. Or at least troll whisper it into obedience. Something. We got there and it began to rain. How nice. Luckily it stopped soon after it started. But it rained just enough to wet the rock and cause showery mini-waterfalls off the overhangs—especially above a section we would have to climb through. In order to dominate the troll you have to climb up on top of its head and drill a spike into its skull. From the lookout tower the granitic blob does indeed have the appearance of a rock monster with shoulders and a head—the head itself being what looks like an avulsed block resting on a slant. The easiest route up the 60-ft-high troll is Class 5. There are three or four route possibilities. They would need scrubbing to work into favor. The easiest route, and the one presumably done by others (there is some minor graffiti on the upper rocks), is on the south side—opposite the side of the lookout. A Class 3 slab in a crease gets one up to a rightward ledge under an overhang. There is small alcove here. Just past the alcove by a couple of steps is a weakness—a wide crack with chickenheads—at a point where the ledge thins to the point one needs to worry about falling off and down 15 feet to the ground if one should peel off the crack. The crack would be awkward to protect…unless you have a #10 and/or #11 hex (the cowbell hexes). I used my cowbell hexes! I used my cowbell hexes! Anyway…the crack is about nine feet high. To the right of the crack are other features to aid the moves. At the top one exits left to a flat. This first 9-ft weakness we rated at Class 5.4 if dry, Class 5.5 if wet. The holds are great. Great for hands; thinner for feet. Jerry led it in rock shoes. I followed in boots (and a heavy pack full of “gear”) and if it weren’t for my wedding ring getting caught on the first move I might have done it gracefully. After the first weakness and the flat shoulder there is another short step. Whereas the first section is largely a crack weakness, the second section is a face about ten feet high (more like a wall, then). The face is about 20 feet long and there is possibly another route at its right end. But we simply went up the middle of the face using more thin ledges and holds. It seemed a little harder—possibly due to the wetness on the lichen. We rated it 5.6 if wet, perhaps 5.4 if dry. So, over all, we think this route (the easiest route) is Class 5.5. Other routes up it would range from 5.8 to 5.11+ but would need scrubbing. But this is Indian land, so you probably shouldn’t do too much of that. To get off we found a bolt, a shiny new one, complete with a short chain. So if you climb it you won’t have to leave a rappel ‘biner. A rappel on our 30m rope got us back to the ledge by the alcove (a ten foot free-hanging rappel for the last part), then a second rappel on what was left of the rope down to the base to avoid having to downclimb the Class 3 crease. Either way. We rappelled because we had the rope for it. And thus was smote the troll. The End (of this fairy tale).

multi-day,Inspired to Climb Spire Point,"Introduction Last year when heading down Eldorado Peak I saw Spire Point's North Face blazing with sunset colors. It looked impossibly difficult, but perhaps that's what caught my attention about this mountain. I studied maps and looked at photographs which all made it seem like a far off fantasy. Interest for this peak arised when Matt Lemke and I wanted to do the Ptarmigan Traverse during the month of August. Matt talked with Gerry Roach about potential routes and did all the research for this peak. Just before heading out to do the Torment Forbidden Traverse, I received a last second invite from Gimpilator to climb Dome Peak. After a few conversations our trip was reworked and set for a 4 day trip. Alpenglow on Spire Point from Eldorado Video by Gimpilator Spire Point itself proved to be an exciting fun climb with low 5th class. This peak is in one of the most remote places in Washington giving the sensation of being a long ways from home. Along the way I saw many amazing things and had a great overall experience. This was perhaps the most experienced team I've ever climbed with which included Jacob Smith and Ryan Hoover. By the end of the trip I was certainly inspired. Spire Point from Dome Peak : Photo Taken by Matt Lemke Rappel on Spire Point Glacier Peak with Lake Upper Dome Glacier Arch Spire with Sloan Hiking on Dome Peak Day 1: Biking the ValleyWe met up at the Suiattle River Road trailhead. From here we pulled out our bikes and made some last second gear arrangements. Before long we hopped on our bikes and started the 10 mile bike ride up to Downey Creek. Sunset from the Valley Biking the Suiattle Road Near Downey creek we stopped to rest for the night. Jacob and I built a camp fire which we all had some fun conversations and joked a bit. But after a while we had to get rest for the big day ahead. Day 2: Approach DayWe woke up, made some breakfast, and were pretty soon on the move up the Downey creek trail. The path was mostly flat and was in great condition with a few minor creek crossings. After 6 miles of hiking we took a rest and filled up water near the bottom of Bachelor creek. The trail did not have as much brush as it's reputation made it out to be, I suppose it's gotten better in recent times. On our way up the valley there were tasty blue berry bushes as well as a few salmon berries. Almost all of us were going to town on them until most of them were gone. Creek Crossing on the Trail Creek View on the Way Green Scenery Above Purple Flowers Misch Peak to the West Orange Mushrooms We took a short cut variation that cut left instead of right which by passed the slide alder section. This variation followed the edge of the woods until we arrived at the avalanche debris section. The route got a little steep here, but was still hikeable. Before long we arrived at the saddle above Cub Lake which was a great picnic spot. Creek Crossing on the way up Bachelor Creek Heading up the Avalanche Debris The Edge of the Spire Point Group As we hiked down toward Cub Lake we could very clearly see Glacier Peak to the South. Around the corner we could see the saddle that we later would camp at. Unfortunately my feet got soaking wet due to the mud sections. I guess that's what happens when you wear approach shoes with huge holes on both of them. Everyone who see's them tells me I ought to throw them out. But they work well most of the time. After a little while longer we arrive at the saddle where we placed our camp. Looking South toward Cub Lake Hiking up the Basin Spire Point's South Face Looking towards our Camp area This was certainly one of the better camping places I've been to. The sunset was a great treat. Dome Peak during Evening An Awesome Place to Camp Looking Down the Valley Late Day Lighting Excited for Dome Peak and Spire Point View from our Camp Alpenglow on Dome Peak East and West Spire Point Sunset to the West Sunset on the Dome Glacier Alpenglow on Bannock Mountain Sunset from our Camp Day 3: Summit Bid on Dome PeakWhen we woke up we were welcomed with a beautiful sunrise. The following pictures portray many of the fun moments during our ""short"" climb up Dome Peak.

Bannock Mountain Clouding Over Sunset on the Clouds Alpenglow on Dome Peak Day 4: Spire Point and OutWe agreed at this point to split up, Matt and I were going to climb Spire Point and head out in the same day. We left camp around 8:00 a.m. and made great time most of the way up Spire Point's south side. Near the top we traversed the edge of the glacier and onto the bottom of the climb. Heading to the right it started out as class 2 but as we went right we got to a class 4 chimney which was fun. I wanted to take some pictures of this part but my camera had ran out of power. Matt fortunately backed me up. The Ridge near our Camp Approaching Spire Point Spire Point's East Face Myself wondering what to Do Here I was on the sharp end exploring around the corner which did not look friendly. Sure it looked possible, but without rock climbing shoes, without a belay, and with a pack on I did not feel comfortable with the idea. If I couldn't see what was beyond it and I knew that I could not safely down climb this spot. Looking around I found a rock that would work for belaying. Matt brought two nut cams and decided he would lead this section. Both Matt and I agree that it was low 5th class. Matt safely made it up top and belayed me up very close to the summit. The last section was kinda slab like. I belayed Matt on a horn, only one of us could summit at a time. I lowered him down which it was my turn. The summit ending was very exposed but was exciting and safe enough roped. There was a nice anchor on the summit to get down on. Using the horn we belayed on we used it for the rappel. The First Rappel Views to the South Scramble Section Spire Point North Towers Rappelling down the Class 4 Section Spire Point's Summit Block Rappelling down the Class 5 Section The rest of the way down had a little scrambling but was mostly a walk down. Back at camp I saw Gimpilator enjoying the scenery which normally he would rather climb peaks. But I don't blame him one bit. Matt and I packed up our gear and had to make good time to get down all the way to car before dark. We managed to find a trail on the way down though the avalanche debris but it had a lot of fallen trees in it. Once at Downey creek the trail kept going on and on which every corner I thought for sure it would be close to the road. It was almost dark by the time we arrived at the bikes. We biked fast to escape the night. We almost made it, but was forced to put head lamps on. At about 8:55 p.m. we arrive at the car which I was very pleased. We had finished two amazing peaks and enjoyed 4 great days in the mountains.

single-day,Lib Ridge in a Day,"I could see the wheels turning in Pete’s head as I asked him if he would join me. “Let’s talk later.” he eventually said, and went back upstairs to work in the climbing department of Mountain Chalet. We didn’t have time to talk about it at the moment, the store was busy with skiers, runners, and casual shoppers. A few hours later Pete brought a map of Mt. Rainier and began to lay out a plan to climb Liberty Ridge in a day. Years ago, I’m not sure exactly when, I began thinking of climbing the Ridge in one fast push, no camp. I have friends who have done the route, and heard their stories of fierce storms and rock falls that rocked it daily. I saw pictures of the huge crevasses lining its approach and the ice wall and bergschrund guarding its exit. Given all the dangers one is exposed to on this treacherous mountain, wouldn’t it be safer to limit the amount of time you spend on it? One day would logically be safer than spending three to five days exposed to arctic-like storms and life-threatening rock falls. But could it physically be done? At that time, I knew the answer was no. But, over the past few years I’ve concentrated on long runs in the mountains to build up a good base of endurance. The summer before this I ran the Leadville 100 and found out what a long day really looks like. Liberty Ridge would combine a lot of things for me. The skills needed to traverse three crevasse laden glaciers, strength to kick up a six thousand foot ridge of snow, rock, and ice, and of course the endurance to link it all together. Maybe more important would be the wisdom that only comes from being in the mountains. What do we bring with us, and what do we leave behind? What weather is good enough? When do we decide if we are going to turn around? Pete Lardy was the obvious choice of partners. As a climber, he was calculating and safe, as opposed to my approach which was just to launch into something and see what happened. He also had big mountain experience, having climbed Denali and taking part in Himalayan expeditions. He knew how to plan the logistics of a big trip and sort out the small details most would overlook. We felt strong and ready the day we caught the plane. Flying over Washington, we caught our first glimpse of volcanoes in the distance. We finally saw what we thought was Rainier. “Well that’s not so big,” I thought. Then the plane banked right and revealed an enormous peak weighed down with heavily crevassed glaciers and dark, rocky ridges. My palms started sweating with anticipation and fear. One day? Once at the Park, we drove to the Ranger station in the rental car and paid the necessary fees and red tape. I watched the expression in the Ranger’s face change as Pete told her our plan. She motioned to the other Ranger for back up, and waited for his arrival before she started persuading us not to go through with it. “This is a very strenuous route.” She said. “ I advise you go heavier and slower on this one boys. Bad weather can roll in unexpectedly and that’s when people start dyin.” We totally understood their perspective, and knew that they must deal with a lot of noobs and idiots who come there not knowing what they were getting into. We just hoped not to initiate ourselves into that category! We compromised and signed up for a bivy site “just in case” though it wouldn’t do any good considering the fact that we wouldn’t be bringing tents, sleeping bags, or camping gear of any kind. Our only protection would be a goretex and a lightweight down jacket. Gear on Lib Ridge (each): Crampons Ice axe Ice tool Short picket Two locking carabiners two wire gate carabiners one quadruple length runner Two prusiks Two screws Two shoulder length draws 5lbs of food, mostly gu and bars 4 liters of water And , one 60 meter twin rope and a small stove Although we widdled the packs down as much as we could, we were surprised to find that they weighed nearly 40 lbs each. A lot of it was the large amount of water we had to carry so that we wouldn't have to stop and brew up more water. We drove to the trailhead mostly to see where it was, and to talk to anyone in the parking lot about conditions. Everyone we found there was wiped out from their climb, and reported deep slush. But, they were all hiking at low altitudes during mid-day. After hearing a few stories, Pete and I came up with a plan. We’d go back to camp and pack up, get a few hours rest, and leave the trailhead by 3 am. This would allow the snow to consolidate, and time for us to reach the Ridge before it softened up at the lower altitudes. As long as we moved fast, we could be back below treeline before nightfall. We slept a solid six hours. I knew my pack was ready and everything lain out. I’d gone over it several times just to be sure. We awoke at two, ate breakfast (a mountain house meal) and drove to the TH. We were hiking by 3am. The trail was mostly snow from the beginning, but was firm and straightforward. We got lost at one point, but only for about fifteen minutes. We topped out on St Elmo’s pass in around 5 hours. We roped up from there and crossed the Winthrop and Carbon Glaciers. Most of the crevasses were covered with heavy spring snow. The few that were open were easily avoided. Up to this point, the weather was questionable at best. The cloud level was low, and freezing rain was common. It wasn’t until we were half way across the Carbon that we broke through the clouds and saw the ridge above us, topped by blue sky above. It was only then that I knew the ridge would go. Pete marched us across the Glaciers like a pro, selecting the most direct lines and watching for tell tell signs of crevasses that I would not have known to look for. To gain the Ridge, we had to run wide left, across a massive crevasse, then come back down to the toe. The sun was now beating down pretty hard and loosing large rocks from the rockband above. We tried to move fast through this part, but finally ran into the soft, deep snow we heard about. A couple times we had small rocks fall between us, so I tried to move even faster, which was a mistake. I crossed over a small rise and stepped into a waist deep “hole” that swallowed my right foot. I tried desperately to free it, all the while thinking of the enormous boulders only thirty feet above my head. The snow setup like cement around my foot, and while I dug out with my hands, axe, and other foot, I sunk my other crampon well into my calf. OUCH! Pete was still behind the rise and had no idea what the hell I was doing. Once freed, we climbed loose, sketchy choss and ice to gain the Ridge. It had taken us 7 hours to get here, and another hour to pull up on Thumb Rock. A team of guided climbers was waiting at the bivy when we arrived. They had been watching us since we crossed the Carbon Glacier and congratulated us on moving so fast. They had taken two full days to reach this point, and were acclimating at 10,500 for the rest of their third day. One guy informed us that the best tent spots had been taken. We politely told him we wouldn’t be needing a spot, and were leaving in a few minutes after we had a snack. We ended up taking thirty minutes for lunch. One of the guides told us that someone had been left by his party near the bergshrund the day before, and said to look out for him or any signs of him. We gradually slowed down above 12000 ft. The altitude was one factor, plus we had been pushing it hard for ten hours, with a gain of 8 or 9 thousand feet. We roped up a pitch below the bergshrund due to ice, and found a nice ledge to belay from. I took our four screws and led out and over steep snow and ice for about thirty feet. While not technically challenging, this lead was a lot of fun due to the exposure and unpredictability of the medium. Above the crux, I went directly for the top, while Pete began simul-climbing to save time. I placed a tibloc in case Pete fell on the crux. The movement of the more challenging terrain excited me and through the focus I pushed it a little too hard. I placed a screw at the exit of the ice face on to liberty cap, and rested my head on the wall. When I opened my eyes I was looking between my crampons down to Pete 200 feet below, then on to Liberty Ridge cutting the Carbon Glacier like a knife. Below that, clouds crept up and shot out to the Pacific. This is the picture I should have taken, and will always regret not having done so. We steered left of Liberty Cap and sought shelter from the harsh, cold winds. At the saddle, we put on more layers and moved on quickly. 14 hours had passed. We skirted the left side of the true summit and cruised down the Emmons, again with Pete in the lead. As we dropped elevation, the weather again deteriorated. Pete was having a hard time seeing wands in the storm (I couldn’t see them at all!), so we were slowed a little. But, he always trended in the right direction and found our true course. The clouds lifted a little just above Camp Schurman, but the wind grew even angrier as it was forced over the Winthrop and around the Interglacier. Half a dozen tents struggled to stay attached. At the Ranger’s hut (about the size of a utility shed) we were welcomed by RMI guides and the climbing ranger. They were confused and thought we were lost because no one had gone up the Emmons all day due to weather. They thought we may have come down the North Face accidently after summiting from the South. We told them where we came from and what we were doing, and they were happy we were ok, in those “little booties” of ours. Pete and I passed up the double plastics for our lightweight leather mountaineering boots, which is not popular in the Cascades apparently. We spent about twenty or thirty minutes here eating and thawing our camelbacks (yes, we were dumb enough to use camelbacks). One guide pointed out the shortest way back on our small map, which he was even less impressed with. The snow was pretty loose past this point, and it took two or three hours to get back to the car from here. We did make it well below treeline before the sun set and forced us to fish out our headlamps. At the car I stopped my stopwatch at 20:01:57. The last thing I remember before passing out was sitting at the picnic table with Pete, as we polished off a post climb six-pack. Pete was nodding off and almost spilling his beer. I think his helmet was still on! We had given ourselves seven days to do the climb, but only had needed one and a half. We spent the next five days cruising the peninsula and checking out the sites. And, drinking more beer of course. A big part of our success on the trip was our ability to train for it at altitude. Pikes Peak is very close to us, and we spent three or four weekends leading up to the climb above treeline, and many months before that hiking and running Barr Trail. Though a big day, it wasn't nearly as hard as a few of the Ultramarathons I've run. My hat is off to the climbers who have to approach this thing from sealevel.

multi-day,Time To Buck Up For Buckner Mountain,"Getting Some Hands To Climb An ArmIn my ongoing quest to summit county highpoints and peaks with a lot of prominence, Buckner Mountain has been high on my ""to do"" list. With some mountaineering friends knowing this, I was recently invited to join several other fellow peakbaggers for a summit attempt of Buckner Mountain, which at over 9112' is the highest point of Skagit County and one of the highest points in Washington. The plan seemed simple enough. Ascend Buckner Mountain via its southwest slope, considered by many to be the least technical route. As such, this route potentially had the best chance for success if conditions allowed. With an expected trek of nearly 20 miles roundtrip in two days over a wide variety of terrain, we knew it might not be an easy trip. However, with a good team and positive attitudes, we were motivated to succeed. Eric Noel initiated much of the initial planning and group setup. Dennis Poulin, Dean Molen, Ken Russell (a.k.a. ""Dundeel""), and I were each invited on the trip. Adam Walker (a.k.a. ""Gimpilator"") was also invited to join the team, but he already had a Glacier Peak trip scheduled for the same weekend as the Buckner trip. However, within two weeks of the scheduled Buckner trip, Dean had to back out of the plans due to family commitments and Adam's Glacier Peak trip was cancelled (allowing him to join our Buckner team). The five-man team (Eric, Dennis, Ken, Adam, myself) for the trip was set. (Sahale) Arm WrestlingOur trip began the morning of July 10, 2010. We met at the Cascade Pass Trailhead at 7:00 AM, and began hiking by 7:30 AM. The plan was to ascend to Sahale Glacier Camp that day, and then the second day traverse east into the upper sections of Horseshoe Basin en route to Buckner Mountain. It was already known that Adam and I considered possibly attempting Sahale Mountain that day. After an hour of hiking up the trail we got Eric's permission to continue on ahead of the group so that we would have extra time to possibly make a Sahale Mountain summit attempt that afternoon. Eric, Dennis, and Ken, in contrast, had all day to enjoy the scenery and reach Sahale Glacier Camp. Looking Up At Cascade Pass Adam and I reached Cascade Pass at 9:45 AM. We turned to our left (north), and saw the next major section of our ascent: Sahale Arm. Shortly before reaching the pass, we encountered several snow slopes. Shortly after leaving the pass, we switchbacked up the Sahale Arm Trail, weaving between snow-covered slopes and melted-out meadow slopes. We reached a small saddle at approximately 6000' elevation, and then began traversing left (northwest) for a short distance. We could see the beautiful colors of Doubtful Lake and it's broken-ice top below us, to the north. Soon, Sahale Arm began trending northeast. This mid-section of Sahale Arm was mostly melted-out. Marmots were seen throughout the meadow ridgetop. Heading Up Sahale Arm... One Of Many Marmots Seen On Sahale Arm Adam and I reached Sahale Glacier Camp at 1:00 PM. The few other tents in the area were located behind small rocky outcrops on the ridgetop. However, we felt the best way to avoid a lot of wind exposure was to put our tent in a small snow basin near where we reached the Sahale Glacier Camp area. In the long run, it might not have mattered. The wind seemed to reach each of the tent sites, although I personally noticed much more wind velocity on the ridgetop than in our small basin. We kept looking up at Sahale Mountain looming nearby to the northeast, and were ready to try locating a low-technical summit route for that peak, if possible. Our Campsite At Sahale Glacier Camp We began ascending towards Sahale Mountain by 2:00 PM. We reached the point where snow met the summit block within one hour, only approximately 50' vertical elevation from the summit. In the days leading up to our trip, as well as during this particular day, we had correspondence with multiple people regarding a possible YDS Class III scrambling route up Sahale Mountain. Our goal was to locate that specific route, if possible. We traversed to the area where the route was supposed to be located. Unfortunately, current conditions eliminated that option in several ways: a snow cornice was located there, multiple rock moats were located there, and multiple boulders had exposed ice on them there. We then traversed back around the summit block to look for other scrambling options. Approaching Sahale Mountain... Within two weeks of our arrival, we knew of other people who found a snow ramp going up to the summit but that appeared to be long-since gone. Eventually, we saw our three climbing partners arrive at Sahale Glacier Camp below us. We decided to head back to camp to eat dinner and rest for the following day's goal, Buckner Mountain, which was my main goal for the weekend. Adam was aggravated at not finding a low-technical route for Sahale Mountain that others had claimed. I tried keeping his spirit high for the rest of the evening by reminding him of the larger mountain that we were to attempt the following day. Buckner... The ""Easy"" Way?After meeting up with our team, having dinner, and going over the plan for the following day, I went back to our tent and decided to take a nap. While laying in my sleeping bag, as the sun went down behind some ridges and the outside air cooled, Adam woke me up to tell me about a strange phenomenon. Millions of tiny black snow worms littered atop the snow surface. I chose not to get out of my sleeping bag to see them, but they were still out when we awoke at 4:00 AM the next morning (July 11). The plan was to leave by 5:00 AM, but several of our partners were not quite ready and still needed to eat some breakfast before starting the climb. We ultimately began our climb by 5:30 AM. We each brought harnesses, and the team had a long rope, but ultimately those items would not be needed. We began by traversing east towards a large rock rib (ridge) angling southeast from Sahale Mountain. Before reaching the rock rib, we descended ~400' elevation down a steep snow slope to the rock rib. We had been advised by several other climbers that although it was possible to traverse down steep snow slopes the entire gully until reaching Horseshoe Basin, it would be much safer to scramble down the rock rib until reaching the basin. With the current snow (and especially snow melt) conditions within the gully there were plenty of hidden stream channels under the snowpack, as well as slick boulders and icy sections. The rock rib definitely seemed like the best option, although perhaps later in summer when less (or no) snow is in the gully that option might be better. Summit Trek From Camp Begins! The scramble down the rock rib was fairly straightforward. However, there were enough sections with loose dirt, loose rock, and the necessity of ""veggie belays"" to warrant extra caution. If the rock rib had been wet, I would never recommend traversing along it. At approximately 6750' elevation, we found a notch containing a steep snow finger heading down into Horseshoe Basin. We had heard about this particular snow finger being a possible entry point for the basin, but with the current conditions (we had seen several avalanches on nearby ridges during our trip) and the uncertainty of the snow slope (and angle) we opted to find another way to the basin. I mentioned the possibility of side-traversing across the large snow gully and then downhill ~200' elevation to a large rock outcrop that marked an entrance to the basin. The traverse involved briefly crossing steep snow slopes that passed over a stream under the snow, but the snowpack was still deep enough and firm enough to pose any fall-through or rock moat issues. While taking a break on the rock outcrop, a three-man mountaineering team passed by us, also en route to Buckner Mountain. Heading Down Rock Rib... ""Veggie"" Belay-Assisted Scramble On Rock Rib Looking Back Up At Rock Rib... It's amazing how sometimes snow can alter depth perception and slope angle perception. From where we entered Horseshoe Basin, the traverse to Buckner Mountain did not look appear to be a long route. But then, as we continued eastward for a while the basin seemed to just get bigger. As we watched the mountaineering team ahead of us become dots in the distance, it became clear just how big the basin really was. Similarly, the southwest slope of Buckner Mountain looked like a very steep (60°) slope from a distance, but as we approached closer it appeared to be only a 30°-40° slope. That also became much more clear as we watched the mountaineering team ahead of us. Looking Back While Crossing Horseshoe Basin... Looking Ahead At Southwest Slope Of Buckner Mountain Adam and I found ourselves leading our team for a majority of the time from when we first entered Horseshoe Basin until reaching the steep snowy southwest slope of Buckner Mountain. Dennis followed right behind us, but Eric and Ken were consistently finding themselves behind the rest of the team. Eric and Ken took a long break at a rock outcrop while Adam, Dennis, and I continued up the steep southwest slope of Buckner Mountain. By the time the three of us were over halfway up the slope, we noticed that Ken had turned around and headed back towards camp but Eric had started continuing behind us again. Eric And Yours Truly Take A Break Adam Ascends Southwest Slope... We were saddened that Ken chose to turn around, but we knew he would just retrace our snowy route path and he had a ""SPOT"" locator beacon in case of an emergency, so a lot of our concerns were alleviated by those things. With Ken's departure, we were actually shocked at how fast Eric ended up ascending the southwest slope. Eric liked to joke how he was fast downhill but not uphill, but this definitely went against that thought. Adam, Dennis, and I reached a small rock outcrop at a saddle approximately 150' vertical elevation from the summit, with only a scramble section remaining. We decided to wait for Eric. To our surprise, he showed up only a short time after we had. We did not know if it was because he was following firm steps already in the snow or not, but his time ascending the long snow slope was still impressive. He is a much more gifted mountaineer than he lets on. Dennis And I Ascending Near The Top Of The Southwest Slope... After taking a break at the rock outcrop, we left our gear there and the four of us reached the summit at approximately 11:30 AM, six hours after we left our camp. We enjoyed the 360° panoramic views for about 15 minutes, but saw clouds approaching in the distance. We briefly considered also traversing to the northeast peak, but large snow cornices and potentially treacherous rock moats obstructed the possible routes there. Although a small number of climbers think the northeast peak is the highest point of Buckner Mountain, a vast majority of climbers (including me) believe the southwest peak is truly higher... even if by only 2' elevation. Given the conditions, it would have been too dangerous and reckless to attempt the traverse to the northeast peak. I am content with that decision, as I am content with the thought that I was on the true summit of Buckner Mountain. Final Summit Scramble... Adam, Eric, And I At Buckner Summit Dennis At Buckner Summit Adam recorded a short video while at the summit. We soon scrambled back down to the small saddle where we had left our gear. Even after spending a short time snacking and reshuffling our backpacks, we descended the steep southwest slope. If the slope had been icy, firm, or partially melted-out (i.e. half-rock/half-ice), it might have been difficult to descend. However, with soft midday snow we were able to make good plunge-steps and great descent time. Eric made the descent look quick and effortless, even adding a short glissade at the bottom of the steep slope. Adam and I followed, plunge-stepping the entire way down. Dennis followed behind us, but had a brief fall on the final steep slope which required a lengthy self-arrest before he stopped. He was uninjured, and we fortunate that would be the closest incident to injury for any of us the entire day. Just When You Think Things Will Go Smoothly...Adam, Dennis, and I reached Eric at a small rock outcrop near the base of the southwest slope. After taking a short break, the four of us agreed to split into two groups: Adam and I as the first team, and Dennis and Eric as the second team. This was because Adam and I had to be back to our vehicle (and home) that evening due to scheduled plans the following day, while Dennis and Eric planned to camp overnight again at Sahale Glacier Camp. Another area of concern (at least for me) was the steadily lowering of clouds filling the entire sky and covering over all of the terrain above 8000' elevation. Clouds Moving In, Adam Moving Out Adam and I made great time crossing Horseshoe Basin. On the other side of the basin, when we reached the eastern edge of the rock rib, we had two choices: traverse around the rock rib as we had during our trek earlier that morning, or ascend the steep snow finger which was more clearly in view than earlier that morning. I was concerned with the unknowns of the snow finger, but Adam was concerned with traversing back around the rock rib. Seeing recent footprints (from within one day of our arrival) up the snow finger, Adam began traversing up the snowy slope and I trusted his judgment and experience enough to follow. Ultimately, it turned out to be the correct decision as it was fairly straightforward with soft snow (but would have been more dangerous/technical with firm or icy snow), and it saved a lot of time. Adam Ascends Steep Snow Finger To Rock Rib Notch... From the notch on the rock rib, we retraced our route from that morning and ascended the rock rib back to the snow slope. By the time we reached the final snow slope leading towards Sahale Glacier Camp, we noticed three main things. First, the three-man mountaineering team was only a short distance ahead of us, halfway up the final slope. Second, there had been a lot of rock fall on the north side of the slope during that day. Third, the cloud-cover was thicker and lower than before, making the top of the final snow slope appear to have near-whiteout potential. The assertion turned out to be correct, as visibility decreased substantially near Sahale Glacier Camp. Fortunately, I had my GPS track log to guide us, when needed and when our general scope of the terrain was ""clouded over"" (so to speak). Eventually, we found Ken at his campsite, and our campsite was only a short walk downslope from that location. We arrived at our camp by 3:30 PM. Adam, As Seen In Near-Whiteout Conditions At Sahale Glacier Camp Ken, Adam, and I (as planned) each gathered our belongings, tore down our campsites, and got ready to begin descending to our vehicles together. Before we left, Dennis and Eric returned safely to camp. They needed to filter some water, so they borrowed Adam's filter for about 20 minutes. During that time, thinking Adam and I would catch up, Ken began heading down Sahale Arm. After Dennis and Eric were done borrowing Adam's filter, we each said our ""good-byes"", and then Adam and I began our descent at 4:30 PM. After dropping approximately 200' elevation from Sahale Glacier Camp, we found ourselves below the cloudline. However, where the clouds ended the wind began. The wind gusts must have easily been 30-40 MPH while we traversed the ridgetop of Sahale Arm, before the final switchbacked slopes leading to Cascade Pass. Once we reached the pass, we found Ken there waiting for us. Adam and I were slightly shocked that Ken made it down to that location so fast. In fact, he had been waiting there a while (as we had earlier seen him there from higher up on the route). Ken, Adam, and I then hiked down the final 3.7 miles together back to our vehicles. Heading Down Sahale Arm... We arrived at our vehicles at 8:00 PM. Being late on a Sunday night, our hopes of finding a suitable place to eat that was still open was unlikely. However, Ken knew of an Italian restaurant in Sedro-Woolley that was open until 11:00 PM. In theory, we had plenty of time to get there. Unfortunately, within a few miles of driving, immediately before reaching the Eldorado Peak Trailhead, my back driver's side tire had a full blow-out. I quickly pulled into the trailhead parking area and stopped the car. Ken, who was driving right behind me, stopped to assist. We soon had my spare tire put on, although I had to drive much slower than I had hoped from that point on. We made it to the Italian restaurant at 10:35 PM, and they were happy to still seat us and allow us to order before closing. Although no other customers entered the restaurant after we had, the owners waited patiently while we ate... and we were happy to give a generous tip in return for the hospitality. Ken, Adam, and I left the restaurant at 11:15 PM, with Adam and I finally arriving back at my house by 12:30 PM. Thinking that nothing else could possibly happen, I entered the house to find... my dog missing. Apparently he had quietly walked outside when somebody had our front door open about 1h30m prior to our arrival, and nobody realized his departure. The general assumption was he was sleeping. With a rainstorm now in full effect, and giving up hope of somebody opening the front door, it appeared he sought shelter from a nearby bush-tree within a block down the street. He came as soon as I walked to the sidewalk and called him. At least he was safe and sound (albeit very wet), and it put an extra asterisk onto what will be one of the mountaineering trips I will look back on fondly in the future.

I was already well aware of John Roper's stance about reaching both peaks. We were going to do it, and had the beta to do it, but we all agreed the current poor conditions of the traverse while we were there would have been too risky to attempt. I was only going to do it to satisfy Mr. Roper, whom I have never even met in person, and I think Dennis, Eric, and Ken were only going to do the traverse for the same reason. Adam was indifferent. I respect Mr. Roper's opinion (as well as yours, or anybody else's) regarding this controversy, but I am going with the majority on this one, including what I consider credible evidence (although not scientifically verified) from some prominent peakbaggers that the southwest peak is slightly higher. If Mr. Roper wants to put an asterisk by my name for now then so be it, but I am satisfied with having summited this peak. Buckner Mountain is a great mountaineering destination. mvs - Jul 19, 2010 6:21 am - Voted 10/10 Re: What? No NE Summit too? Great TR Redwic.

I searched all around the base of that rock for a somewhat safe ascent and only found solid class four on loose wet rock, not worth it for us. I am surprised that Buckner is a less technical ascent, it looks gnarly from the flanks of Sahale. Redwic - Jul 19, 2010 2:02 pm - Hasn't voted Re: nice TR Agreed. From Sahale Glacier Camp, the snowy southwest slope of Buckner initially looked like 60° and quite imposing. Then a ranger told us it was 40°. Then two people we passed the morning of the summit trip, who had just done the North Face of Buckner, told us the southwest slope was only 25°. As we got closer to the mountain, we knew 25° was too low of an angle and 60° was definitely too high of an angle. The southwest slope was probably around 35°-40°, manageable with good snowpack, with the final summit block being a steep scramble. skjos - Jul 20, 2010 10:40 pm - Hasn't voted TR Helped Us Out Hit Sahale, Buckner, and Horseshoe last weekend and your trip report helped us judge route conditions.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/liberty-ridge-july-2006/206731,"Liberty Ridge, July 2006",2006-07-02,"A Few DetailsRoute: Liberty Ridge Trailhead: White River Dates: June 30 - July 2, 2006 Summit Day: July 2, 2006 Descent Route: Emmons Glacier Climbers: Joseph Bullough (myself), Brian Dutton And a special guest appearance by Lubos Pavel June 30, 2006 - Drive DayOur adventure to climb Mount Rainier's Liberty Ridge began on Friday, June 30. Brian arrived at my house 10 minutes early, excessively prompt as usual, and we proceeded with the challenging task of stuffing all our gear into Brian's Hyundai. We'd both adopted the strategy of ""if in doubt, bring it"", figuring we'd eventually decide what to carry at the trailhead. Sunrise in Glacier Basin By 6:10 am we were on the road for the 800 mile drive from Salt Lake to Rainier. I made a quick phone call to call in sick take the day off work, then pulled out my Glacier Travel book and settled in to review crevasse rescue procedures during my turn in the shotgun seat. Twelve long, un-air conditioned hours later we were finally closing in on our destination, Cake's ""Comfort Eagle"" on the stereo providing the soundtrack to these final miles. Rounding a bend in the road we were treated to our first sight of Rainier; much larger and grander than either of us had expected. Brian's first comment: ""hmm..., there's still a lot of snow up there..."". We made our way to the White River Ranger Station to pick up climbing permits and camp reservations. Based on several trip reports we'd read during our climb research, we expected to be interrogated by the climbing ranger regarding our skills and experience, but this did not turn out to be the case. We were also pleased to learn there were still camping slots available in Glacier Basin that evening, which would allow us to knock off 3 miles on our arrival day, rather than spending the night at the trailhead campground as originally planned. Winthrop Glacier from St. Elmo Pass After the short drive to the trailhead it was decision time; we began sorting and cramming gear into our packs, trying to take everything we thought we'd need, but nothing more. The biggest decision seemed to involve tent vs. bivy sacks; we wavered back and forth, ultimately opting to go with bivy sacks based on the good weather forecast for the next few days. Around 7:00 pm we headed up the trail, making the uneventful hike to Glacier Basin in just under 90 minutes. Feeling pleased at having been able to put 3 miles and 1,500 vertical feet behind us on our ""drive day"", we settled in for the night. North Face of Rainier July 1, 2006 - The ApproachFeeling no great urgency to rush things on our approach day, we elected to sleep in until around 5:30 am. Awakening to perfectly clear skies we packed our bivy camps, ate a few cold snacks for breakfast, then began the long march towards high camp at Thumb Rock. We followed patches of primitive trail for a short distance, but soon found ourselves on continuous snow as we began switchbacking our way up to St. Elmo Pass, at around 7,400 ft. For the first time on this trip we began to gain significant elevation, and my legs soon became aware of the 50+ pound pack on my back. A few negative thoughts floated through my head as I contemplated lugging this load 5,000 vertical feet up steep snow and ice at high altitude on Liberty Ridge. Would I have the strength? Was I up to the task? I had my doubts... On the Carbon Glacier Arriving at St. Elmo Pass we were greeted with the expanse of Winthrop Glacier, bordered on the far west by Curtis Ridge. We also began to see the first glimpses of the upper portion of Willis Wall, on the north face of Rainier. Beyond Curtis Ridge lay the Carbon Glacier, which would lead us to the base of Liberty Ridge. We moved down onto the Winthrop Glacier and began following a faint boot track headed west. A few crevasses made their appearance, but the route through appeared fairly obvious so we elected to remain un-roped for the time being. Some time later we observed what appeared to be a lone climber headed in the same direction about 1/2 mile ahead of us. Closing in on the Ridge At the far end of the Winthrop Glacier we moved onto the rocky terrain forming the lower half of Curtis Ridge. Continuing a westward traverse across the rocks we eventually reached a vertical impasse on the west wall of Curtis Ridge, with the Carbon Glacier below. Here we met up with the lone climber who had been scouting around for a way down onto the Carbon. Our initial impression was that we would need to make a very long detour north to the base of the ridge in order to scoot onto the glacier, but we soon discovered a very loose and steep ramp which made its way down the west face of Curtis Ridge. Now on the Carbon Glacier we began the trek towards the base of Liberty Ridge, clearly visible to the south. Crevasses were more abundant here than on the Winthrop Glacier, but the route still appeared relatively straightforward so we remained un-roped. The solo climber was now behind us but keeping up at a fairly steady pace. Avalanche on Willis Wall The customary approach to Liberty Ridge traverses west around the toe of the ridge then ascends to the ridge crest from the west. But this being a fairly late season climb of Liberty Ridge, the standard approach was quite broken and menacing, so we elected to follow the better terrain on the left and hopefully gain the ridge from the east. Our un-roped freedom came to an end upon reaching a gaping crevasse with a very thin and partially collapsed snow bridge being the only path across. Inviting the solo climber (Lubos) onto our rope seemed the logical thing to do, so we roped up and belayed each other across. Ironically it turned out that Lubos was from our home state of Utah as well, having made the trip solo after his planned partner bailed out on the trip. The ironies increased when we later learned that not only was Lubos from Utah, but we'd also crossed paths with him on two previous occasions; a Kings Peak ski tour in March, and the Wasatch Triple Traverse in May. Yet another irony occured in 2007, when Lubos was the first to arrive at the scene of an accident on the Pfeifferhorn, back in Utah. Looking up at Thumb Rock Nearing the east face of Liberty Ridge we were temporarily distracted by a huge avalanche which pounded down the Willis Wall directly to the south. The avalanche cloud spread broadly upon hitting the Carbon Glacier, and about 20 seconds later we felt the air blast and sting of snow particles from the dying cloud. Soon after we were able to exit the Glacier onto the east slopes of Liberty Ridge, where we filled our water bottles before making a short but steep scramble up incredibly loose rock to the crest of the ridge, then onto the mostly snow-covered slopes on the west side of the ridge. All that remained now was an uneventful climb to our camp at Thumb Rock, now visible on the skyline above. The rock appeared deceptively close, but the 2,000 vertical foot climb through steadily softening snow seemed to take forever, and it was a great relief to finally arrive at the sheltered saddle behind Thumb Rock at around 4:30pm. It came as a bit of a surprise to find the camp completely unoccupied, since we'd been told by the climbing ranger the previous day that six parties were at various points on the route. Preparing my Bivy Ledge at Thumb Rock Camp We set to work preparing our individual bivy platforms, then spent the rest of the afternoon lazing around camp while melting snow for water. In an attempt to keep things simple I'd made the decision to forego hot meals on this trip, so dinner consisted of energy bars and jerky; Lubos' hot dehydrated meal was looking mighty tasty... Later in the afternoon another large avalanche roared down the Willis Wall just to the east. The weather had been perfect all day long with not so much as a cloud in the sky, and we hoped the fine weather would continue into our summit day. We agreed on a 4:00am start time, then settled into our respective bivy sacks for a short night of sleep. July 2, 2006 - Summit Day and DescentI slept well early in the evening, but woke more and more frequently as the night progressed. Was that 4:00am Utah time or Washington time? We'd never really discussed this fine point. As the designated alarm clock I supposed it was up to me to decide. It was only 3:00am (Pacific) but I was restless and anxious to get the day underway, so I crawled out and gave a shout to Brian and Lubos; time to get moving. Sunrise from Liberty Ridge By 3:30am we'd packed our respective camps and began the slow march up the ridge, heading left around the first rock band immediately above Thumb Rock, before regaining the ridge above. Snow conditions were ideal, perfect for step-kicking up the remains of the boot track from parties of the last day or two. We climbed steadily and soon the first hints of light began to appear in the sky to the east. Some time later I looked up and noticed a thin wisp of cloud curling over the summit of Liberty Cap above. Hmm..., hadn't seen any clouds up there yesterday... The sun was fully up as we passed around the left side of the Black Pyramid on crumbly rock and dirt, where we found ourselves looking up the 600-800 foot long 50° ice sheet leading to the base of Liberty Cap. Ice axes were replaced by ice tools, and feeling confident in our climbing we elected to remain un-roped through this steep section; Lubos moved towards the far right side of the slope, while Brian and I selected a more direct line up the middle. Alpenglow on Liberty Ridge As we continued climbing we were once again distracted by the unmistakable sound of another avalanche on the Willis Wall, much closer now that we were higher on the ridge. I turned briefly to watch the expanding cloud of snow and ice as it rumbled down on our left, but my calf muscles were complaining bitterly from the continuous crampon front-pointing, motivating me to continue moving upward. The ice sheet seemed to go on and on, and I began to tire in the thinning air. I stopped periodically to chop small boot sized ledges in the ice in an effort to give my burning calves a break, but the effort hardly seemed worth it. At one point my headlamp somehow detached from my helmet and fell to my arms, so I quickly shoved it into my jacket pocket, but apparently not securely enough; a few seconds later I heard the sound of the headlamp skittering down the slope. I shouted to Brian who was directly below me, and he made a leaning attempt to snag it with an ice tool, but just barely missed. I gave a final glance as it continued its sliding journey to the base of the Willis Wall several thousand feet below. Traversing around the Black Pyramid At last the angle slowly began to taper off, and eventually we reached moderate snowy terrain where we were able to take a break. The small wisp of cloud from earlier in the morning had now grown to completely enclose the upper portion of the mountain. A few hundred more feet of hard snow and we reached the first of several crevasses at the base of Liberty Cap; finally time to rope up. We each took a turn or two on lead, deferring the more difficult pitches to Brian, the Alpha-Climber of our group. Visibility was now alternating between a couple of hundred feet down to near zero at times, but we were thankful that it seemed to be nothing more than a high cloud, rather than an actual storm. A final pitch of 60° ice and we arrived on a snowy ridge. We remained roped as we trudged up the ridge until there was nowhere to go but down. It could only be the summit of Liberty Cap. Cloud Cover about to Close In Visibility was still near zero, so we began wandering in the general direction of the true summit, periodically checking map and GPS to verify our bearing. At one point we actually discussed aborting the summit attempt to begin seeking our descent route, but other than greatly reducing visibility, the cloud cap did not seem overly threatening, so we elected to keep pushing for the summit. Snow finally gave way to rock and a short distance later we were standing on Columbia Crest, the summit of Washington, at 1:40pm and over 10 hours since leaving camp at Thumb Rock. We un-roped and removed gear, then snacked and rested for a few minutes before preparing to descend. A pair of climbers from another route popped up from the summit crater, and after talking over their plans, Lubos decided to descend with them via Disappointment Cleaver. Brian and I said our goodbyes to Lubos, then began a traverse around the summit crater in the general direction of the Emmons Glacier, our planned descent route. Me and Brian Simul-Climbing below Liberty Cap Still enclosed in clouds and with virtually no visible clues, we continued relying on occasional map and GPS bearings until we eventually reached a prominent boot track which could only be the Emmons route. We followed the track down a thousand feet or so until eventually breaking out of the cloud cover. Camp Schurman could now be seen far below, still a depressingly long way off. With such a prominent track down the Emmons Glacier we once again took the calculated risk of remaining un-roped as we worked our way down through the crevasses. Lubos (above) and Brian Just Below Liberty Cap We descended for a seeming eternity to the zoo-like Camp Schurman, then over the ridge and back into Glacier Basin. We managed to get a couple of nice glissades down the Inter Glacier, then completed the final three miles back to White River Trailhead in a fatigue induced trance. The climb hadn't been perfect, but Liberty Ridge had been good to us, and we savored the feeling of having returned safely from a very memorable climb on an outstanding route.

Nice report. Do you know what the elevation gain difference is between starting at the White River campground or going up Burroughs Mtn to St Elmo's pass from Sunrise? Derek Joseph Bullough - Jul 11, 2006 2:34 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Great... Thanks! Starting at Sunrise gives about a 2000-foot elevation advantage, but from what I read this advantage is mostly lost due to routefinding issues. Since this was my first time on this mountain I really can't verify or deny whether this is actually true. Travis Atwood - Jul 11, 2006 2:32 pm - Voted 10/10 Great Report Nice work Joe! Sounds Like you guys had a great climb. I hope to be able to do this one some day. Best, Travis Joseph Bullough - Jul 11, 2006 3:33 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Great Report Thanks Travis!

Thanks Lubos MountaingirlBC - Jul 14, 2006 3:42 am - Voted 10/10 great read! looks awesome from my comfy armchair position :) marauders - Jul 19, 2006 7:37 pm - Voted 10/10 Nice one! Great TR. Oddly my buddy and were on Rainier too at the same time as you, expect we took the more relaxing DC route. I'll have to work up to the Liberty Ridge. Looks amazing (and far less busy)! Too bad the stubborn cloud moved in, I bet pics from that 60 degree slope looking down the entire mountain would have been awesome. Joseph Bullough - Jul 19, 2006 10:06 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Nice one! Wow, small world - would have been something to run into you up there. You guys must have summited on our approach day, which was an outstanding day. I kept looking up at the sky thinking 'if that will just hold out 1 more day', but it wasn't to be... It was still a great climb though, despite the limited visibility. And like you said, a far less busy route! TJ311 - Oct 21, 2007 4:13 pm - Voted 10/10 great TR Thanks for the great trip report!

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/enchanting-enchantments-adventure/193636,Enchanting Enchantments Adventure,2005-08-20,"PreparationThere is a beautiful PDF that is a compilation of trip reports from all the participants on this trip put together in a magazine type format with photos right here. Preparation for this trip started in early February. Permits for the Enchantments are notoriously hard to get and the allocation system gets tougher and more exclusive every year. So I timed my application to arrive on the first day they were accepting them and enclosed a letter, shamelessly begging and pleading the all powerful staff at the Leavenworth ranger station to hear my prayers and award me the 6 permits I was asking for. Getting permits is one thing. Getting permits for the dates and areas you're requesting requires nothing short of divine intervention. I sold my soul, and I waited. I had spent 4 days in the Enchantments the previous September but the weather had been truly horrible with only one 4 hour window of sunshine. Being too cold, wet and miserable to fight with my water filter, I had foolishly drank right out of one of the lakes the last day. I paid for it for the next month as I battled Giardia. The trip had been a bust but the intoxicating beauty of the area had not escaped me, even when veiled in clouds and blanketed by snow. I couldn't wait to go back. I had 4 people already committed before I sent off for the permits and was pretty confident I could fill two more spots by putting the trip on the BCMC calendar so I asked for 6 permits. Much to my delight, I received permits for the exact dates and places I had asked for. This was to be the first of many strokes of luck. The trip filled up almost immediately but 3 weeks before, Telus went on strike and we lost two people. I had no trouble finding people willing to take their spots but it wasn't until about a week before our departure date that everything was nailed down. The final team consisted of: Marian - my friend and climbing/hiking partner for the past 4 years. Totally competent hiker/climber who shares my passion for all things alpine and doesn't mind unexpected adventure. Quirine - great gal I had hiked with a couple of times in the past 2 years. I knew she was in good shape and had a great attitude. Tai - relatively new friend of mine. we've spent a lot more time walking our dogs together than hiking but I knew Tai to be very easy to get along with and an experienced hiker. Mike - I'd never met Mike but he was so excited when I told him there was still room on the trip I knew he was going to be great. He'd been trying to get permits for years so he'd obviously knew what he was getting himself into.... or so he thought ;) Jason - I'd never met Jason either but we'd had some good online communication going and I knew he knew his stuff. Experienced climber with attitude extraordinaire. And Me We got together for a planning meeting a week before the trip. Unfortunately Tai was in the Rockies warming up and was unable to make it. The rest of the group got along incredibly well right from the get go. We sat yakking in a coffee shop on Main Street for 4 hours. What an awesome group dynamic. We did some route planning, talked gear, made shopping lists, and generally had a great time. Jason and I hung out over the roof of my car for another hour before we finally departed in the early morning hours. Jason was coming on the condition that I climb Prusik Peak with him. Since we'd never climbed anything together, it seemed prudent to at least do one warm up climb before we left to make sure we worked well together. I also wanted to make sure that he was comfortable with my ability and skills. I had been sport climbing for many years but had very little trad climbing experience. On Monday we descended upon Deidre, a classic 5.7 multipitch route in Squamish. It was obvious from about 5 minutes in that we made an awesome climbing team. I led the 5th pitch which was my first notable trad lead. I never expected to lead on Prusik but it seemed like a good idea to at least have a little experience... just in case. After a great climb, we stopped for a bite to eat and more trip planning. Jason spearheaded the gear list while I busied myself with the collection of route beta and the emails flew furiously in the days leading up to the trip. I don't think anyone got much work done those last few days. Our brains were already on vacation. Then finally.... after months and months of waiting and planning.... it was time to go! Day 1Our adventure began with a 2am meeting time. The team convened at Marian’s house in Steveston for a group packing session. We had so much community gear it just made sense to dump it all on the floor and pack together. We quickly realized that we had about 30 pounds of chocolate between us. This was going to be a great trip! We piled into Tai’s truck and Marian’s CRV and were on the road by 3:20am, planning to stop at the Chevron at Steveston Hwy and 99 to fuel up on caffeine. Within about 4 minutes we had lost each other. Fortunately we had agreed to meet again once through the border so we hooked up again there. Thankfully, the border guard did not feel compelled to unpack our beautifully packed backpacks and we breezed through with no trouble. We pulled into Leavenworth just after 7am. We had to stop at the Leavenworth Ranger Station to pick up our permits. They had also thrown in free parking passes which was ultra cool of them. You need an annual pass or parking permits in order to park at the trialhead. My annual pass had expired and there was nowhere open to purchase them at that hour of the morning so the rangers had kindly thrown in two free passes after a panicked phone call the day before. Then it was off to Sandy’s Waffle House to carb load and inflict our excited sillies on the rest of the early morning breakfast crowd. We had a great waitress who accommodated our every request and put up with our exceptionally goofy behaviour. She even provided Jason with a Ziploc bag full of brown sugar which was well above and beyond the call of duty particularly after what he said to her after she asked if 8.5 inches was big enough (she was talking about the pancakes). With full bellies & brown sugar, we had only to tank up on caffeine at Starbucks before the short drive to the trailhead. Since we’d done such an exceptional packing job at Marians, there was relatively little messing about at the trailhead. My pack was heavier than it had ever been between the usual gear and food one needs for 5 days and the climbing gear Jason and I were sharing but it was manageable as long as I had someone to pull me into a standing position. I wish we’d had a scale but I would estimate I had close to 70lbs and Jason’s was probably well over 80lbs. After a few visits to a particularly smelly outhouse and the token group shot at the trailhead, we were on our way at the respectable hour of 9:32am. The trail to Colchuck Lake is well graded & pleasant the whole way. We took several breaks along the way as we were in no hurry and wanted to conserve our energy for the dreaded Aasgard Pass which is a 2200ft climb in less than ¾ of a mile. A bachelor party came upon us during one of these breaks where we were busy with the first of many very silly photo shoots. The girls posed with the groom since his friends were obviously too cheap to take him to Vegas for the weekend or even to a strip bar. Tai had not slept at all before our early morning departure and had only been back from another extended backpacking trip for 2 days so he was feeling the pain of no sleep and a heavy pack. He managed to stumble and pull a muscle which wasn’t helping matters. We were in no rush though as we had budgeted up to 12 hours to get to camp so we were all able to go at our own pace. Radios made communication easy as we made our way up to the lake. Spectacular Colchuck Lake presented itself at 1:15 with its turquoise waters nestled at the base of Dragontail’s famed Serpentine Arête route, the Enchantment range’s precipitous cliffs, the steep, icy Colchuck glacier and the lush green forest that flanks its western shores. It took about an hour to make our way around to the south end of the lake. I had conveniently forgotten about the big boulder field we had to traverse before we could ditch the packs and enjoy a lunch break on the sandy beach at the base of our nemesis, Aasgard Pass which rose 2200 feet above us in ¾ of a mile. Lunch was a light hearted, leisurely affair. Tai was not looking like a man who was ready to haul a heavy pack up Aasgard Pass so when he wasn’t looking, I pillaged his pack and divvied up the spoils between Jason and I. Tai was so exhausted he didn’t even notice. This was key to the success of the mission because had he noticed he would have insisted on carrying it all himself. The weather was perfect and it required a great deal of willpower to remove my ass from the sandy beach and get cracking. Jason and I needed a bit of a head start on the hill ahead of us so we started off slightly ahead of the rest of the group at 3:15. For some reason, the first quarter of Aasgard was the worst. Maybe we just didn’t wait long enough after eating but we were both fighting off waves of nausea. My head was pounding and Jason was overheating like a furnace. We had made the first big clump of trees our goal and it was with precious little energy reserves left that we stumbled into our first rest stop. Mercifully there was a waterfall about 20 feet off the trail where we were able to cool off. Mike and Marian joined us shortly and we all flaked out on the rocks for a while. My waist belt was not helping with my nausea so I dug out my camp towel which I used for extra padding when I at last decided to get moving again. That helped a lot and I was able to get a better rhythm going for the rest of the climb. With my tummy padded and my baseball hat pouring icy cold water down my head, we set off again. I decided it was time for my secret weapon so I fished out my mp3 player. What a difference a little heavy metal can make! I found I was able to just get into a zone and march. With AC/DC, Van Halen, Bon Jovi, Guns & Roses and a few other old friends I was able to rock my way up and over the top at a pace that quite surprised me. It took me 3 1/2 hours to get up Aasgard. Once at the top, I did my best to convey my elation and awe at what was unfolding before me to the group still trudging up the pass in hopes of giving them a little energy boost. I then extricated myself from my pack and just soaked it all in. What a difference from last year! The last time I had been up here it had started snowing halfway up Aasgard so the Upper Enchantments had been a winter wonderland. This time there wasn’t a flake of snow to be found. Even the glaciers were down to their bare icy bones. I had been able to see the Dragontail glacier from part way up Aasgard but had not even recognized it. The Upper Enchantments basin is a barren, rocky place dotted with sparkling blue green lakes, surrounded by majestic, rugged, tantalizing peaks. It really does feel like a whole ‘nother world up there. The other thing it is famous for is wind, a fact I was soon reminded of as I sat quickly cooling off on my rocky perch. I was willing everyone else to join me as I was more excited about sharing it with them than I was about seeing it myself this time. Before long, Mike, Jason & Marian topped out and the ooing and aahing began. Q and Tai were about 45 minutes behind and we stayed in radio contact with them. After such a steep climb, we practically skipped along the trail in search of the perfect camp site. Our perfect camp site revealed itself about 20 minutes later at 7:10pm in a big flat sandy spot overlooking one of the many lakes, nestled up against a large band of rock which afforded some protection from the wind. A waterfall provided the mood music as we quickly went about setting up camp. We weren’t 10 minutes into the task when the neighbors, Momma and Baby Goat came by for a visit and all camp chores ground to a halt. I had spent 4 days up here last year without seeing a single goat so you can’t imagine how excited I was. Jason went into full on National Geographic Photographer mode, capturing what was to be the first of many encounters with our wooly white friends. We were willing Tai and Q to hurry along so they could see them but the goats wandered off before they arrived. About 10 minutes later however, we got an excited call on the radio from them. Apparently Momma & Baby had decided to go great them too. With all the campers safely & happily in camp, we were ready for dinner! Jason had been promising something spectacular and we were not disappointed when he pulled about 20lbs of food out of his pack. Tortillas, veggie ground beef, rice, organic bell peppers, cheese….. who’da thunk it? Burritos for our first night in camp! How decadent! Dinner was magnificent and much appreciated by all. The moon was rising now and put on quite a show for us, glowing bright orange/red. I tried to snap some pictures but my camera wasn’t having any of it. Jason was happily snapping away though so I left him to the task, went to pee on a rock (they ask you to pee on the rocks because the goats love the salt in urine and will tear up any ground you pee on) and brush my teeth. It was a beautiful night but I was too tired to spend any more time watching the sky so I just crawled into my cozy sleeping bag and went to sleep, dreaming of our adventure to come the next day…. Dragontail & Colchuck peaks! Day 2We had set the alarm for 8:00 but we were all up before then. Once the sun hits the tent it’s hard to go back to sleep. It had been a very windy night and I was glad to have packed my earplugs. I was sleeping with my pack beside me and every so often it would roll over on to me as the wind put the tent to the test. It was a beautiful day and I could see the Dragontail glacier from the door of my tent. I had attempted Dragontail solo last year but had been turned back by winter conditions so I was anxious to finish the job. I had to admit that the glacier looked impossibly steep but I knew it couldn’t be as bad as it looked as it was a well known scramble route. The first order of business was to retrieve the food. Keeping food away from goats above the treeline is interesting. The key is to find a drop off that is too steep even for goats and to hang your food over it. Fortunately there was such a drop right above the ‘kitchen’ area of our camp site. The food bags certainly took a beating being dragged up and down this small cliff at least twice a day though. Breakfast was tea and oatmeal. Jason was very generous with his dried fruit which was nice as it kicked the oatmeal up a notch. He also shared the bag of brown sugar he had scored at Sandy’s the day before. We were back on the trail at the crack of 10:30. We had some business to attend to on the way and were very happy to find that the local potty was not in fact locked as had been earlier reported. There were two containers awaiting airlift that had been mistaken for the toilet but further inspection revealed a lovely little wooden toilet hidden in the scant brush. Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh much better! We hit the trail again and hung a left at Aasgard Pass. Scrambling over huge boulders and rocky cliff bands brought us up close and personal with the Dragontail glacier. At this point, Tai decided that he’d had enough and would make a better base camp manager than climber. He was exhausted from the day before. Since we had not covered any particularly treacherous terrain to this point we decided that he’d be ok heading back to camp on his own. We gave him a radio and agreed to touch base when he got back on to the trail, and then every hour on the hour. The sun was warming up the glacier and small rocks were coming down it regular intervals. We quickly realized that this was not the best time of year to be doing this. The closer we got the less steep the glacier became. The only real concern was the rock fall. Up to now it had only been small rocks but there was a huge pile of giant rocks perched precariously at the top of the glacier. This was where the small rocks was coming from so it was a little disconcerting to know that we were going to have to travel directly below it. We studied the problem at length and in the end, picked a line that would allow us to travel quickly and give us the most warning if anything above came down. The first move was to take shelter under a large boulder where we would put our crampons on and get our ice axes off the packs. We moved one by one with the rest of the group watching for rock fall and soon the 5 of us had reached the boulder. We had just removed our packs when the rumbling started. Marian screamed “ROCK!” and everyone scrambled to ensure that they were protected. I couldn’t see the rest of the group as I was tucked safely around the other side of the rock under a lovely little overhanging section. As the first rock came crashing down I shoved my pack out of my way and burrowed as deep into my little cave as I could get. I was then able to turn around and watch as the next rock came down. The ground was shaking and the air was filled with the rumbling of the rocks rolling down the steep glacier and the ‘pop’ and ‘bang’ as they hit other rocks. The rock we were under became a launch pad and I watched with shocked disbelief as a rock the size of a love seat bounced off of the roof of my cave, and spun in the air about 6 feet above me like it was a football. Debris trailed out behind it like a shooting star as it rose in a gravity defying arch before resuming its course down the mountain. My heart was pounding as adrenaline coursed through my body and I remember thinking “when is it going to end?” as the third large rock headed towards us. I didn’t see this one but felt it hit the top of or hiding spot. Q was yelling “FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!” I couldn’t see him but apparently one of the rocks bounced about 5 feet behind Mike as he was ducking for cover. Finally the rumbling and banging subsided, easing off as the smaller rocks and debris cascaded down. Finally it was over. Someone was yelling to me and I shouted back ‘SAFE!’ I could hear everyone’s voices and breathed a sigh of relief that everyone was ok. Everyone instinctively stayed put, waiting for any ‘aftershocks’ to come down. Q's eagle eyes noticed a flash from far below and wondered aloud if someone was signaling us. I immediately remembered Tai and realized that if he had just seen what had happened he must be freaking out. I jumped on the radio as fast as I could to tell him ‘we’re ok!’ He had seen the whole thing, watching helplessly as the rock came down on us but couldn’t see well enough to know if we were safe. Once the adrenaline started to wear off I quickly realized that all I wanted to do was to get everyone the hell out of here. We exited stage right, one at a time, using the same method we’d used to get under the boulder in the first place. Once safe, I broke out the pharmacy and attended to Q’s leg gash while Mike attended to his own battle wounds. They had both banged themselves up while diving for shelter. Just then, two climbers appeared at the top of the glacier. They had obviously come up Colchuck and were planning to descend the Dragontail glacier. They say things happen for a reason and it was spooky to think what might have happened had we not been there to warn them of the danger. Jason was able to shout to them. “This route is suicide” and that seemed to do the trick. I had spoken with a ranger a few days earlier who had told me about another route which took you down around the back of Little Annapurna so Jason told them to go down that way. The remarkable cohesion of this particular team shone through in the way we reacted to the situation. Everyone remained calm and worked together to ensure the safety of the group. The rock fall had been one of the most terrifying experiences of my life. Since I didn't know most of this group well, I worried about how they might react. In the end, I had nothing to worry about. I was so proud of everyone. This team seemed to thrive on challenge and adversity and only became closer and stronger as the trip went on. We spent about 20 minutes sharing our respective perspectives of the experience before we began the scramble back to the trail. Back at camp, I deeply regretted not bringing my little voice recorder as nothing I can ever write in this trip report could ever come close to capturing the moment as perfectly as our real life accounts immediately after. Having Tai’s perspective was particularly interesting. Watching had shaken him up pretty badly and brought up some painful memories for him. He was so relieved that we were all safe. As terrifying as the experience had been, I think I speak for all of us when I say that we had never felt so alive. In hindsight, of course there are things we could have done differently. There really wasn’t a safe way to get across that glacier given the weather/time of year. It wasn’t even dropping down below freezing at night so an alpine start would not have solved the rock fall problem. The only solution is to do it earlier in the season when there is still a fair amount of snow on the route. We also should have been quieter so we could have heard what was going on above us more clearly. We did a lot of things right too though which resulted in us all escaping injury and having a great story to tell. Climbing mountains is not without risk no matter how cautious and well prepared you are. We all have an acceptable level of risk. All you can do is mitigate those risks to the best of your ability. After debriefing and lunch at camp, we decided to give McClellan a go. The beta we had made it look like a reasonable afternoon objective. Tai opted to stay back at camp. I think he was secretly planning to find Mike’s cel phone to call his RCMP buddies for a helicopter rescue. We were overlooking Crystal Lake in no time but the route was not obvious. I eventually realized that we were supposed to have headed south sooner. The route was a steep decent from the base of Little Annapurna down to Crystal Lake about 800 feet below. Then we figured it was another 2-3 hours to the top. There just wasn’t enough daylight left to get us back up on the trail by dark. The beautiful little lakes of the Upper Enchantment basin were beckoning so we decided to go frolic in them for a while, and then bag Little Annapurna which would also give us the opportunity to scope out the alternate Dragontail route. The route up Little Annapurna was a blast. If you stay a little to the right of the boot track, you can scramble up on low angle slab most of the way up. The effects of the previous 10 hour day with a brutally heavy pack started to catch up with me and for the first time all trip I didn’t feel very strong. Then I remembered that I hadn’t had anything to drink since lunch time. I re-hydrated and was feeling much better by the time we reached the summit. Although Little Annapurna is just a walkup mountain, it’s still well worth climbing. The views are fantastic and it’s really fun to climb up the east side and down the west. We climbed up ‘Baby Little Annapurna’ too which is just to the west of the true summit. Jason and I goofed around under a cool overhanging rock and looked waaaaaaay down to the nasty gully we would have to ascend en route to Dragontail the next day in order to bypass what had been affectionately named 'the bowling ally' on the Dragontail glacier. We meandered along the ridge for a bit hoping to find an alternate route. We did find one we thought would go but would later realize that it wasn’t going to work. On the way down to Isolation Lake, Mike, Jason and I came upon a teeny bit of glacier with a tunnel running right through it. That was too much to resist so we all got filthy and wet slithering through it. It was great fun. When we finally made it down to the lake, we stopped for a photo shoot. After much more goofing around and funky ballet moves we started heading back to camp. We would have made it too had a ptarmigan not refused to move from our path. This of course prompted another photo shoot. We were on the move again for less than 5 minutes when another one of these crazy birds nearly got stepped on. It was so nice to have the time to take crazy pictures and terrorize the wildlife. It’s really like a playground up there. I could easily spend at least 2 weeks just roaming around. It was my turn to make dinner so I broke out the Pasta Primavera and tuna. I just love those little foil packets of tuna you can get now. Dinner was yummy and many two bite brownies were had for dessert. After dishes and a bit of star gazing it was time for bed. I needed my rest because the next day, Jason and I were taking on Prusik Peak! Day 3We awoke to a chilly morning with some clouds. Not enough to change our plans but enough to be a little worrisome. We had breakfast and packed up as quickly as we could but still got a later than optimal start. Jason and I were planning to climb Prusik and the rest of the team was heading for Enchantment. Enchantment peak is said to have the best view of the rest of the Enchantments basin. The Enchantment crew took off first but we were not far behind them. It was so exciting seeing Jason’s reaction as we hiked through the Enchantment basin. It sounds so cliché but it really is a magical place and every step just reveals more and more beauty. We were so enjoying the scenery that we completely missed the turnoff to Prusik. This is particularly embarrassing since I know exactly where it is. Marian put it well when she said ""I would have expected a unicorn to pop out at any moment, but I would never have expected Julia and Jason to miss such a well marked turn off."" I’m not sure how much further along we would have wandered had Tai not radioed and snapped us out of it. DUH! We were almost at the end of Spirite Lake. The turnoff for Prusik is at the end of Perfection Lake and is extremely well marked with a wooden sign and a trail that is practically paved with flat stones. It wasn’t a big deal and I was actually happy to have wandered a little further so Jason could see a little more of the Lower Enchantments area as we were not going to be passing through that way again. It only took us 15 minutes or so to get back on the right track and soon we were huffing and puffing our way up Prusik Pass. At the top of the pass we dumped our packs and took in the view. I had not been up this way last time so I was happy to check out Shield Lake & Edwards Mesa. We also got our first peek at our route up Cannon Mountain which we were planning to climb on the way out on Wednesday. After a little scrambling we came to the big balancing rock where we swapped our boots for our rock shoes. Jamming feet that have put the kind of miles and elevation on that ours had in the past couple of days into rock shoes was not a pleasant task. Finding the route proved to be more challenging than we’d anticipated. The more we looked, the more we realized that our beta was woefully inadequate. The wind was picking up and I was re-thinking the wisdom of my wardrobe choices as I shivered in the shade of the dark and looming north face. We gave up looking for an obvious route and decided to just climb. Jason took off, lamenting the size of his rack. We had to travel light so we couldn’t bring all the pro we would have liked to. Fortunately I have the utmost faith in Jason’s pro placement so I didn’t mind freezing my ass off while he took extra care to ensure that each nut & cam was going to hold in the event of a fall. With Jason leading, the climbing was easy for me. The rock was very sticky, albeit a bit sharp sometimes. To say Jason’s nut placement is solid would be an understatement and this was driven home on the second pitch when no amount of smashing and bashing on my nut tool with a rock would loosen one of the nuts. I hated to leave it behind because we already had such a skinny rack but it wasn’t coming out. When I topped out, Jason went back down to give it another try but it wasn’t leaving its crack. As he was climbing back up, I noticed something white tucked into a crack and pointed it out. To our extreme delight, it was 4 pages of route beta including diagrams. What were the chances of that? We soon after pulled ourselves up onto a ledge on the ridge and into the much welcomed sunshine. It felt sooooooo good to warm myself in the sun and get out of the icy wind. In spite of our new found beta, the route still wasn’t popping out at us. Jason went on a recon mission that involved a few tricky moves. Convinced that this couldn’t possibly be the route, he returned to the ledge, dropped back down the north face, and tried a really scary, nasty traverse. I couldn’t see him but his colorful language painted a pretty clear picture. Just then, two climbers came into view that had obviously just finished rapping down. We called out to them and they graciously shared a lot of valuable information with us. The original scary route was indeed the right route. We were on track and that route beta we had found was theirs. Jason was not at all pleased about down climbing what he had just done but he made it back in one piece. We hopped back up on the ledge and had another look. It was 4:30. There was no way we were going to have time to summit and get down safely before dark and the wind was turning us into climbersicles rather quickly. There really wasn’t much choice but we still agonized over the decision for several minutes. We wanted this SO badly but it obviously was not meant to be so it was with heavy hearts and frozen bodies that we rapped back down to the trail. By the time we made it back to our boots the wind had reached gale force. I have seriously never experienced anything like it. We cowered under the balancing rock listening to the wind roar around us. Apparently the cold and altitude were getting to us. The tired sillies told hold with a vengeance as we imagined all the ways in which the resident goat population might help to warm us up. We laughed until we were both clutching our stomachs in pain and tears rolled down my face. After the disappointment of Prusik, it was nice that we could still have a good laugh. As soon as the wind dropped to the point that we could escape without being blown all the way across the Enchantment basin, we scurried back to the trail and started the long hike back to camp. Dropping down 300 feet from Prusik Pass then back up another 600 to our camp went by much more quickly and painlessly than I expected. Perhaps it was just that it felt so good to have circulation in my feet and feeling back in my legs. Or maybe it was just the great company. Jason and I got along like old friends right from the get-go so hiking with him even after getting spanked on Prusik was still a pleasure. The spectacular scenery helped to ease the pain too. Before long we were back at camp and chowing down on Black Bart Chili courtesy of Q and Marian. It was then that we realized that our fuel supply was not at all what we had expected it to be at this time. Jason and I had done the math over and over and we should have had enough fuel to boil 78 liters of water. Our two fuel bottles were feeling uncomfortably light however. So it was with much regret that we decided to forego the mystery dessert Q had planned for us that night. The wind was still howling and no amount of layering could keep out its chill. We really needed to have a group meeting about the next day’s plans but it was too cold to continue sitting in our little kitchen area. Q mixed up hot chocolate for everyone and we all huddled in the vestibule of my tent. Then Q did something that ensured that she would be the last person to be voted off…… she brought out a platypus full of Bailey’s! That was the best damn hot chocolate I have ever tasted. But there was an even bigger treat yet to come. We started discussing the plan for the next day. The Dragontail route we had scoped out the day before no longer looked feasible now that we had had a good look at it from up on Prusik. We couldn’t get to Colchuck without getting up Dragontail first so that was out too. We could do McClellan, or just poke around exploring & ridge walking. Jason and I both really wanted to try Prusik again but I had told him I didn’t feel comfortable leaving the group again and that it wasn’t up to me. I wasn’t even comfortable suggesting it. Jason obviously didn't want to bring it up either. It wasn't until pressed by Q that he admitted our desire to have another go at it. No one even hesitated. The decision was unanimous and genuinely enthusiastic. Of COURSE we should try again! I could have kissed everyone. Once again, I was absolutely floored by this wonderful group of people. We decided to move camp in the morning to put us closer to Cannon which was our objective for day 5. There were several spots we could camp along the way around Perfection, in the meadow at the bottom of Prusik Pass, or, there was a beautiful spot at Gnome Tarn, right at the base of Prusik. We decided to play it by ear and just see how it looked when we got there in the morning. We set the alarm and snuggled into our sleeping bags, warmed by Bailey’s and the anticipation of another exciting day ahead. Day 4No clouds today! It looked like the weather gods were smiling on us as Jason and I prepared for our second attempt of Prusik Peak. We were all up before 7am. We had assigned tasks to each team member the night before to ensure a speedy departure. As it turned out, we all ended up doing different things than we’d planned but it didn’t matter because everything got done. Just another example of how seamlessly this team worked together. If something needed doing, it just got done. No tea this morning as we were fuel rationing. Camp was packed up, bellies were filled with oatmeal and we were on the trail by 8:30. It was a very chilly morning so I couldn’t bring myself to take off my down jacket before setting off. As expected, I was sweating by the time we dropped down out of the wind. The day before I had found a toilet with a magnificent view of Prusik so we made that our first stop. It’s at Inspiration Lake which was about the half way mark between our old camp and Gnome Tarn which was to be our new camp. The wind was incredible. I was almost able to lean into it without falling over. Brrrrrrr! All this time Jason had been packing his kite around. Surely today would be the day he’d get to fly it! We had a good laugh at the intersection of Prusik Pass, remembering how Jason and I had breezed right past it the day before. Rather than climbing up Prusik Pass today, we would take a hidden trail Jason and I had found on the way down yesterday that would lead us right to Gnome Tarn. About ¾ of the way up we came upon a male goat and two babies. It’s interesting. The males seem to take a very active role in child care in the goat world. Soon we were on the flat, open, sandy shores of Gnome Tarn. Given the current wind situation, we opted to set up camp up against the rocks which would afford us better wind protection. Tai and Mike however sacrificed a good night’s sleep to art and pitched their tent in the best location for a night shot of the illuminated tent with Prusik rising up behind it. The standing water in the tarn looked a little dicey so Q and Marian generously offered to bring water up from the river 300 feet below. In the end, they hauled up 10 liters each. 9 goats immediately began doing laps around our camp site. We joked that they were just the recon team and that an army of thousands probably lay in wait. Eventually the goats settled down on a patch of sand beside Tai and Mike’s tent. Jason and I decided to take this opportunity to infiltrate the herd in order to learn more about their diabolical plans and in doing so hopefully save the team from certain death. With stealth and cunning we strapped crampons to our heads and descended from our lofty bipedal positions to adopt a more goat like posture. Slowly we began to approach the herd. Our clever disguises afforded us much confidence as we knew we blended in seamlessly with the surrounding ecosystem. In order to establish our dominance, we engaged in a mock battle, butting horns and pawing at the ground. Our dominance in the bag, we approached nearer still, pausing to forage on the rough grass that dotted the landscape. After all the exertion and fiber rich food, I enjoyed a good roll in the gravel. It was time to put my new goat powers to the test. Prusik wasn’t going to climb itself so after chowing down on a quick lunch, Jason and I packed up and began the short hike back to the base of Prusik’s dark, cold north face. It was much colder than the day before but this time we were prepared for it, wearing virtually every stitch of clothing we had. There were two other climbers just starting their first pitch when we arrived at the boot removal station below the balancing rock. They looked to be very off route already but we were hoping that they, in fact, knew something we didn’t and that we would be able to follow them up. It quickly became evident that they were even less prepared than we were so we scampered past them and started looking for where we had started climbing yesterday. It was the strangest thing. I felt like someone had rearranged the face overnight. Nothing looked familiar except for one lonely yellow rap sling. We ended up traversing further along than we needed to but Jason thought he recognized a dihedral mentioned in the route beta so we set up a belay station and he headed up. Seemed like the further up he went, the worse it got. I was very aware of the time and didn’t want to have to turn back because we had run out of time so when the going got rough, and then rougher, I encouraged him to sling a flake and come back. We knew we could get up via yesterdays route so I didn’t see much sense in continuing up what was obviously not the right route. After yet another scary downclimb for Jason, we traversed back along the trail and found our original route. The wind just got stronger as Jason headed up. I eventually managed to squeeze myself into a gap that afforded a little bit of shelter. Jason called down that he could bring me up to where he was but I told him to just keep going. I wanted to keep moving with the least amount of screwing around with gear possible. It was a very long pitch and I was frozen solid when Jason shouted that he was safe. I stomped my feet and swung my arms around to get the blood moving again before setting off on my own. I immediately recognized the rock from yesterday and moved as quickly as I could. Happily, all the pro came out relatively easily this time as the rock was very cold and unpleasant to hang on to for any stretch of time. Soon I was up on the ledge with Jason, warming my hands in the sunshine. During our ascent to the ledge, the other team had decided to turn back. They'd climbed themselves into trouble and were freezing and had deemed it unsafe to continue in this weather. I was surprised to find Jason seriously giving this sentiment consideration. I pointed out the fact that it may very well be dangerous for them, as it had been for us the day before, but today we were prepared with the right clothing. Jason quickly snapped out of his temporary insanity. I think it may have been brought on by acute rack envy as the other team had about 5 times more pro than we did and I know he was worried about it. From our perch we could see our camp site and Mike and Tai moving around. What a thrill to have an audience! We waved to them excitedly and chattered on the radio. Being so high up and so exposed suddenly didn’t feel so bad since we could see ‘home’ from where we were. It was definitely a comforting feeling and I again felt very blessed to have such a supportive team. I had left my camera which has 10x zoom on it with them so I hoped they would get some good shots of us climbing. It was time to face the crux. Jason had done all the hard work up ‘till now and I knew how much he hated slab so I offered to lead it. I still had an overwhelming drive to keep moving. I had only lead two previous trad climbs. One easy 5.6 at Mount Erie several years ago and the 5th pitch of Deidre in Squamish on Monday. To say my experience was inadequate was an understatement. But there was one cam fixed on the route which if it hadn’t come out by now, wasn’t coming out and beyond that, there were very few places to place pro anyway. What scared me the most was the wind. I’d never experienced wind like this anywhere, let alone while climbing with little more than friction keeping me on the mountain. I decided not to put much thought into it however. We’d made it this far yesterday and I’d be damned if I was going back now. After a very stern lecture from Jason telling me that if I needed to come down he didn’t care what pro I had to leave behind, I was off. The first little bit was not difficult. I clipped into the lost cam and I was soon able to girth hitch a lovely solid feeling horn. I enjoyed the feeling of security it offered as I knew it was the last time I was going to feel that way for a while. Once out from behind the protection of the west ridge, the wind was ferocious. I couldn’t even breathe. I traversed left to the base of the scary slab where I found an ancient fixed pin that could very well have been there from Fred Becky’s first ascent in 1957. I tried to get a nut in but the crack was just too shallow. Communicating with Jason required me to curl my upper body up against the slab to get the radio out of the wind. The wind was quickly sapping my body heat and I knew that if I hung around too long I’d lose my nerve so I told him I was just going to clip into the pin and get it over with. Unbeknownst to me, Jason suddenly found religion at this point. Animation of me on the crux. You'll probably need to click it to see it properly.I quickly scanned the smooth face of the slab looking for any ‘thank god’ holds I could look forward to but there were none. ‘Keep moving!’ I told myself and before I could think about it I made my first move. I moved slowly & cautiously, making sure I always had at least 2 solid points of contact. The wind continued to drive into my back as I inched my way up the 16ft slab. About half way up I paused for a moment at which time I indulged myself in contemplating the possibility of a downclimb. A quick check below put an end to any hope of retreat. It was up or bust. There were a couple of better holds near the top but I continued with the same snail like pace for fear of being blown right off the route. Finally I hauled myself up over the top, swinging my right leg over the south face while my left trailed down the north. I heard Tai on the radio say something like ‘that was the scariest shit I’ve ever seen in my life’ which made me grin. I must be having fun then! My straddling position felt relatively secure and I tried desperately to get a nut in. My hands were freezing and try as I might I just couldn’t get a decent placement. I decided that the hump I was currently straddling would serve as a kind of protection in the event I fell down the south side, which was where I was headed so I stopped fiddling with my crappy nut placement and moved on. The south face offered 100% protection from the wind and a nice wide crack into which I quickly placed a cam before finally allowing myself to relax somewhat. There was a nice long horizontal crack which served as a bit of a cat walk. Without the savage wind, the going was much much easier. At the end of the traverse was ample room to maneuver and set up a belay station. It was then that I realized that I hadn’t really brought anything to set up a good anchor with. I mentioned this to Jason and told him I was going to try to MacGyver up an adequate anchor but to make himself comfortable as I knew it was going to take a while. Kicking myself for not bringing more slings, I started hunting around for a good place to put a cam. I found one and quickly clipped myself into it. After much fiddling, I had a nut in to my satisfaction and clipped into that too. I tried and tried to sling a rock but I just couldn’t reach. I managed to sling a bit of a horn overhead but in the end it was just to difficult to equalize with that one in the system and I decided to make do with what I had. Jason told me to use the rope by tying figure 8’s on a bite and to equalize the system as best I could. After much fiddling around, I came up with a pretty solid anchor. I removed the unused sling and looped it through everything just for extra backup. I later learned that the way I had it through the wire of the nut was a bad idea but it worked with the cam. I yanked and jerked and yanked some more. When I was finally satisfied that I had a bomber belay station, I radioed Jason that he was on belay. It seemed like mere seconds had passed before Jason’s head popped up over the top of the slab. The nut I had placed there came out easily in his hand which wasn’t terribly surprising but that was the only shockingly bad pro placement. Thankfully my anchor passed inspection and Jason decided to go on a bit of a recon mission to scope out the next pitch. After about 10 minutes Jason had found a route that would go. I offered to lead it but was not at all disappointed when he said he would do it. I’d pretty much used up all my macho reserves on the last pitch and was positively giddy with the accomplishment and the fact that the rest of the route looked relatively straightforward and obvious. We were actually going to do it this time! The next pitch was a very fun traverse with a fantastic photo op. Jason actually had me downclimb back to the photo op spot and I’m so glad he did. The photo is amazing. Moving quickly and easily with the security of Jason’s placed pro and a solid belay I was over the traverse in no time. Much to my surprise, Jason was standing on a beautiful big ledge that even had a bit of grass and a few wildflowers. Even more surprising was the fact that the wind had stopped. And I mean stopped. It was almost as if the mountain was saying ‘ok fine… I’m obviously not getting rid of you two so go ahead and climb me.’ Snack time! After gobbling some snacks and enjoying a nice long pee we were both raring to go again. A beautiful corner crack beckoned. Jason loves crack climbing and this pitch was less exposed than most so I took this opportunity to snap to pics of him. His camera is so heavy and bulky it made me nervous to be taking pictures while belaying. This pitch seemed pretty benign however so I snapped merrily away. Jason did not seem pleased with his performance on this pitch but it looked good to me. When I followed, I never really had a good position from which to take out pro so I can only imagine how much more difficult it had been for Jason. Thankfully, it was a short pitch and we were soon back in the sunshine again. The summit was truly in sight now. Jason continued to lead and seemed to be making things more difficult for himself than absolutely necessary. I suggested that he move a little to the right and from there he quickly and easily ascended the flake. He was out of sight now and I took in the magnificent views as I belayed. Lake Vivian sat nestled up against Prusik’s south face. Above that, Spirite Lake seemed to be sitting on an impossible angle, slowly tipping its contents into Vivian. Our cozy camp and cheering squad lay far below. I thought I heard Q and Marian but it seemed impossible that we could hear them from so far away. They had taken off on their own adventure today which involved scrambling and skinny dipping in the lower Enchantments. Maybe they were back. It would be great if they could see us top out! Jason dumped most of his gear so he could squeeze into the chimney for the final push to the summit. Before long he was whooping and hollering and I knew he had summited. My turn! In 4 or 5 moves I was on the ledge below the chimney. I tied a figure 8 on a bite and started clipping stuff on so Jason could haul it up. Finally it was time to haul myself up. I wedged myself into the chimney and used my elbows the way Jason suggested to wiggle my way up. In a couple of minutes it was all over and I was standing atop Prusik Peak. Sure enough, Marian and Q HAD been watching our ascent from where we had left our boots and we heard Q shout out ‘We love you guys!’ They had been taking pictures of everything and we leaned over the big summit block for one last shot. The true summit was about 20 feet away so we quickly scampered over to place our hands on the very top. At just over 8000 feet, we felt as if we were on top of the world looking down on the breathtaking beauty that is the Enchantments. Jason was kind enough to help lighten my load for the rappel down by sharing my chocolate stash. After a nice rest and many photos, it was time to head down. The first rap station was quite a sight to behold with loads of multi-colored slings and many rap rings. Doesn’t get much more bomber than that. I had spoken with a park ranger who had been up here about a week earlier and I knew that they had taken down about 20lbs of webbing from the route so I was pretty confident in what was left. The rap off went off without a hitch and we were soon back on the trail that traverses the north face. It felt like we were much further east than we had started off and I was not looking forward to hiking for any length of time in my rock shoes. It also seemed like we were awfully low and a steep ascent back up to our balancing rock was not high on my list of things I wanted to do that afternoon. To my great delight however, we weren’t nearly as far away as I expected and in less than 10 minutes we were huddled back under our rock, extracting aching toes and feet from rock shoes. No hiking boots had ever felt so good. My new Dunham Waffle Stompers felt like slippers just then. Still high from our summit success we decided to try a new route back to camp. We had fun scrambling down large boulders, most of which stayed put and were back in camp shortly thereafter. What a wonderful, warm reception we got! My heart felt like it would burst. Marian, who has been my climbing/hiking partner for 4 years now, was genuinely happy for us which was very big of her. She would have liked to have climbed Prusik but it just wasn’t possible for all 3 of us to do it this time so she was an incredibly good sport about it. I couldn’t believe how much I had lucked out with this team. So incredibly supportive… such great attitudes… they really embodied the word ‘team’ to me. Their presence was felt every step of the way as Jason and I climbed Prusik. I would definitely consider it a group effort. It would have been a sweet climb with just the two of us but having everyone cheering us on made it so much more special. No matter what I climb in the future, this experience will always hold a very special place in my heart. Climbing with Jason had exceeded my greatest expectations. We seemed to work together with an adhesion you would only expect from climbers who had been climbing together for many years, not from two climbers who had only just met. His experience & skills were instrumental in getting us up and down safely. His personality, sense of humor and lack of ego made the experience totally and utterly enjoyable, even in my coldest, scariest moments. I had complete confidence in Jason’s judgment, ability and skills which made it much easier for me to ride the rails on the outer edge of my comfort zone. Jason got to work on the stove in order to get some water boiling for dinner. I sorted out the rack and the rest of our gear and by the time everything was put away the dinner bell was ringing. I didn’t feel the least bit hungry but the moment I put a spoon full of that delicious veggie lasagna in my mouth I was suddenly ravenous. I positively shoveled food into my mouth. Someone passed parmesan cheese around and I happily doused what was left. Tai broke out the English muffins and I merrily piled lasagna onto one, devouring it bite by bite. When I was sure I couldn’t scrape another bite of food from the sides of my cup I went for the brownies. We ate 1.2kg of Two Bite Brownies on this trip. They’re heavy but worth every drop of sweat. Lethargy was setting in fast. I was so grateful that Tai took on dish washing duty that night. I couldn’t move. I finally dragged myself upright and gathered up the food bags for hanging. After Tai and I hung the food, I crawled happily into my tent. I read for a little while then drifted off into the best sleep I’d had the whole trip. Day 5Normally I’m ready to head home by the end of a trip but that was most definitely not the case this time. I really didn’t want to leave this perfect place. I expressed as much to the team and found that I wasn’t the only one having a hard time saying goodbye. But it wasn't over yet. I had another exciting day planned for us. We were going to hike out via Cannon Mountain, then down the northwest ridge to hook up with an old logging road which would take us back to the parking lot. This area doesn’t receive a lot of traffic and apparently the views from Cannon are awesome so that took the sting out of knowing that this was our last day. While there wasn’t actually a trail, I had a lot of good route beta including a GPS track on a map so I was confident. I had even spoken with a park ranger and a local about the route, both assuring me that it was do-able. We had enough fuel for breakfast and the oatmeal this day was a veritable feast as we poured everything we still had left into it. No one wanted to carry food out. Brown sugar, cinnamon, skim milk powder, cranberries, raisins, apricots, even Two Bite Brownie crumbs, it all went in. It was soooooooooo yummy! I’m absolutely taking cinnamon next time. It weighs nothing and made such a difference! We decided to forgo tea in favor of burritos for lunch. Jason had some leftover rice which we cooked up with my left over black bean soup mix. He had another package of tortillas, some veggie ground beef, sausages and cheese so lunch was shaping up to be pretty darn good! In hindsight, I am SO grateful that we had that feast for lunch. Lord knows we needed the calories in the hours ahead. Camp was all packed up and we were hiking by 10am. The goats immediately moved in but will have been very disappointed in what we left behind. We were a very contentious group packing out everything… and I mean EVERYTHING. Tai somehow managed to get the job of garbage/sewage pack mule. I guess that’s what you get for being a nice guy. We hadn’t even reached Prusik Pass when I said “What’s that smell!?” Sure enough, Tai was up wind from me. Poor guy was hiking in a haze of stank! It was time to use my emergency orange garbage bag. After double bagging the trash bag, we quickly caught up with the rest of the group at Prusik Pass. There was a nice family of 4 there and we took pictures of each other while chatting about our intended route. The father knew the area well which bolstered my confidence even more. He told us to say hi to Coney Lake for him and we were on our way. It was fun being off trail and we picked our way easily along the back side of Enchantment and over to Cannon’s eastern slopes. Mike and I hiked on up ahead a bit to ensure that we weren’t leading the rest of the group into trouble. We could radio back if the route didn’t go but go it did and soon we were at the Lorelei Lakelets. A weasel (I think that’s what it was) was hastily carrying its baby along the lake shore away from us. The lake was beautiful and we enjoyed a little rest & snack break while we waited for the rest of the group to catch up. I had another look at the map and saw the route very obviously leading up from the end of the lake. We headed off again with Jason and I bringing up the rear. We were enjoying drawing out the trip and savoring every moment. We let everyone race up the last steep slope we’d have to ascend on this trip while we took in the views, reliving moments of greatness and marveling at the scenery. Our slow pace allowed me to notice a skull in the sand at our feet. Looking at the teeth on this thing, Jason suggested maybe a saber toothed marmot. A quick Google search just confirmed our suspicions… it’s a marmot all right. We stopped for a little photo shoot but we couldn’t drag it out much longer. In a few more minutes we topped out on the magical ‘Druid Plateau’ just below the summit of Cannon. The Druid Plateau is several football fields in size, flat as a pancake save for the stepping stone type rocks covering much of its surface. We had fun running around, hopping from rock to rock and taking in the stellar views. Dragontail, Colchuck & Stuart were laid out before us like a postcard. A lone goat lazed on a large rock pile looking at us disapprovingly. Jason had a great idea for a group photo. We all posed on different rocks. He’s going to Photoshop all the pictures together. Rather than try to describe it, I’m just going to put the photo in here. After at least an hour of horsing around, we shouldered our packs again for the short hike to Cannon. We left our packs at a nice lunch spot and began the scramble up the summit of Cannon. I tried to avoid looking at our descent route. It looked much steeper than I’d bargained for so I just pushed it out of my mind and hoped that it would look different by the time we came down from the summit. Scrambling up Cannon was fun and the views just got better and better. The true summit is the top of an enormous boulder. With my awesome new boots, I knew I could scramble up and down it. The bottom of my boots feel like suction cups on slabby rock like this and, as expected, I scrambled up without incident. I was only able to talk Jason into joining me however. I was thrilled to have gotten Tai up another mountain. Little did I know that getting him up Cannon was going to be infinitely easier than getting him down! We climbed back down to our picnic spot and had our first good look at our route. Unfortunately it hadn’t gotten any better looking since the last time I’d looked at it. So I announced that it would probably look better after lunch and herded the group back up and away from the edge. The last meal on a trip like this is usually pretty forgettable but lunch was a veritable feast! Jason really deserves a lot of credit for hauling a lot of really heavy, really yummy food all the way up there. We gobbled up every bite and got down to the serious business of discussing the route. It was already after 3:00 so one thing was sure. I wasn’t willing to tackle the ridge. There was no way I wanted to be stuck up that high when the sun went down and the wind started up (as it did every night). Going back did not seem like a very practical option. So I figured as long as we could get down to the tree line by dark, we’d be fine. The gully looked steep but manageable so I tried to convey a confidence in my body language and voice that I didn’t really feel. I felt sure that everyone could do it, but that they wouldn’t be very happy about it. We hadn’t been moving for 5 minutes when we ran into the first spot of trouble. Q and Tai didn’t feel they could descend with their heavy packs on. No biggie…. I’d take their packs. I would much rather shuttle packs than turn around so I just told them to leave their packs. I figured this was the worst of it and if we could just get down this first bit it would get easier. Jason and I worked together to get everyone and everything down but it wasn’t getting any easier. Poor Jason seemed to be a loose rock magnet and rocks that had happily held my weight would pop loose under his greater weight. Pretty soon Jason suggested that we take out the rope and while he helped people down with the rope, I began shuttling packs over a new route I had found that seemed more solid with nice big boulders. Jason had had enough of the mountain slipping out from under him so he set up a rap station which we used to shuttle packs and ourselves down while the rest of the group picked their way down the loose, steep gully. Unfortunately things were just going from bad to worse but no one was complaining so I wanted to keep up our forward momentum. The next rappel was nasty, dropping quickly over an overhang. I was worried about being flipped over by the weight of the pack so I hooked a prussik on to the rope and the chest strap of Tai’s pack. His pack did not fit snugly into my back like my pack did and sure enough as soon as I hit the overhang I flipped over like a beetle. Every muscle in my body fought to right myself but it was futile. My left quad was on fire and there was nothing I could do to relieve the strain. I was afraid that Q and Tai might be watching and I knew that it looked bad so I shouted out “Help! I’ve fallen and I can’t get up!” like in that goofy commercial so they’d know I was ok. Righting myself was impossible so I just continued to lower myself in my incredibly uncomfortable position right down to the ground where Jason could help me up. My next rappel went even worse. This time my left hand got caught between the rock and the rope when I dropped off the overhanging part. Hanging helplessly from my left hand I realized that I couldn’t climb up and I certainly couldn’t go down so I had no choice but to just yank my hand out. I continued down as fast as I could because if I was really injured I didn’t want to be hanging from a rope when I realized it. It looked ugly & it hurt but I didn’t think I was really injured. I got Q to take a look at it just in case and she gave me a green light. I wasn’t too worried about the cuts and scrapes. I was more worried that I may have damaged some tendons when I yanked it out. It seemed to be functioning well under the circumstances so I just wrapped it in a gauze bandage to keep the worst of the dirt out. Jason decided to take the last two packs down on his own employing the same method one uses to get one’s pack out of a crevasse. He was all ready to go by the time I scrambled back up to the rap station but I pointed out that I did not have first aid supplies to cover a botched vasectomy, motioning to the sharp ice axe point just inches below his bits. He was determined that it would be ok and was being very stubborn about the whole thing but did wait long enough for me to tie my sports bra top around it. I cleaned the rap station and scrambled back down in time to watch Q’s $400 Mountain Hardware tent bouncing merrily down the mountain side… and she was laughing! Delirium had clearly set in. Fortunately the tent did stop and she was able to retrieve it without further incident. That was the end of the pack shuttles. The sun was setting fast though and we couldn’t even see the tree line. I desperately wanted to get everyone down to the tree line by dark. Jason had the brilliant idea of setting up a hand line so with Mike in the front, Jason in the middle and me taking up the rear, we were able to string out 60m of rope for the others to hang on to. We had hoped we’d be able to move more quickly this way but it was still slow going. I got frustrated with the pace so I found a secure spot for myself and told Tai to just rap off of me down to where everyone else was. This worked beautifully and secured my position as team belay station for the next several hours. Jason would scope out a good tree/boulder/anything I could wedge myself in behind. I would get in position. Everyone would then rap off of me down the full length of the rope. Mike always went first, scoping out the route and finding the next possible belay station. Then Tai, Marian and Q would go. Tai has indoor climbing experience so this wasn’t totally new to him. Marian has loads of experience and flew down like a pro. Q, however, had never done anything like this before and was having trouble just trusting the rope. Going down a mountain backwards went against every natural instinct in her body (naturally!) but she never once complained, only asked for clarification and support and moved slowly but surely down the mountain. I have to say a few words about Q here because she really did a remarkable job. Over the course of that long long night, her confidence grew exponentially. She was smart enough to tell us when she wasn’t ok but trusted us enough to do what we told her to do. Jason rigged up a chest harness for her with some extra webbing and put her on a prussik so in the event that she fell and let go of the rope, she would still be safe. I really admire her quiet determination and self control. Not once did she panic and she always kept her wonderful sense of humor. The sun was setting fast. It really was a beautiful sunset. I told Jason that I wished it would just get it over with because then the pressure would be off and when it finally did set, it was almost a relief. No more racing against sunset. It was dark. No big deal. Just keep moving. Up until this point I had been scrambling down, unroped, after everyone had rappelled. But now it was dark and the prospect of descending the gully solo was not particularly appealing so on the next rap, after everyone but Jason and I had rapped off, we used the little shrub (to call it a tree would be an overstatement) to rap off of. Jason found a boulder we could use for the next 30meters. I went first and found our group perched on what could not even be described as a ledge. I started hunting around for anything we could rap off of but it wasn’t looking good. It was really dark as the moon had not risen yet. Even when it did rise, it would be a long time before it came out from behind the mountain. The stars were beautiful and they put on a great show for us with shooting stars and even a display of the Northern Lights. Everyone remained positive commenting on how we would have missed all this if we’d gotten down sooner. By the time Jason joined us I still hadn’t come up with anything. Jason got to work on a crack that while I continued to explore the cliff looking for something better. I had dropped the rope at the end of my rappel and traversed this cliff solo earlier but this time I looked down. Yikes! For the first time on our descent I was a bit freaked out so I told Jason I wanted a belay to get back. He was still working on setting up an anchor and it seemed like forever before I was finally able to get the heck out of there. Everyone was getting cold but there wasn’t much room to maneuver so no one had bothered getting more clothes out of their packs. I knew I was going to be there the longest so I did take the time to find a place where I could lay my pack down and get some more clothes out. Jason went off in search of a better rap station. Nothing was popping out at him so I put him on belay so he could explore the cliffs on the opposite side of the gully. He soon gave a triumphant cry as his fingers found two lovely cracks just begging for pro. Working as quickly as he could, Jason set up a fantastic rap station and we were soon back in business. Using the section of rope I had used to belay him, we were able to make a hand line across the gully. As had become the custom, Mike went first, traversing the gully and then rapping down off of Jason’s anchor. Mike's confidence and experience had been a very nice surprise and a real blessing. We were desperate for some flat ground where we could get warm clothes on, rest and have a snack so we waited with baited breath as he descended down the steep gully into the night. His headlamp marked his progress and before long he was on the radio describing a much more hospitable place. Tai went next, then Q. This was the steepest section we’d had to contend with so I suggested that Jason just tie her in and lower her. This worked brilliantly as Q felt much more confident with the constant security of a lower and she was able to move down more quickly than ever. Marian shot down the rope like a bolt of lightening and then it was my turn. First I had to get Jason’s pack over to him so I used the hand line to cross the gully and come back. Then, I tore down the station, tied myself in so Jason could belay me, and moved slowly over the rocks & gully with my own pack. Jason was freezing and I felt quite helpless as in our precarious position there was really nothing I could do to help him. All I could do was get down as fast as I could so he could follow. Mike had indeed found a great spot. I immediately dumped my pack and went off to find the next belay station. Trees! There were actually two or three options. I take back everything bad I ever said about trees. (I’m an alpine junkie and have been known to make disparaging remarks about hiking through trees…. I repent.) Jason seemed to be taking an awfully long time but I knew what he was doing. He had to tear down the rap station, leaving just one nut and rap off of that. Rapping off of one nut is not much fun but if anyone can find a solid nut placement its Jason so I was confident that the extra time he was taking would ensure his safe descent. I also knew he was freezing so he’d be moving more slowly than he’d like. Finally his headlamp was on the move so I found my last cliff bar and met him on the ‘landing pad.’ He insisted on bringing down the rope before attending to his own comfort which is pretty characteristic. I had quickly learned to pick my battles with Jason when he’s being stubborn so I let this one go. As soon as the rope was down I took it and the rack and moved them down closer to our next rap station. Tai dozed on the ledge while the rest of us piled on every stitch of clothing we had. The night was mercifully mild, the mildest we’d had all trip in fact, so with all our clothes on, we were cozy and comfortable. A rest was mandatory so we hung out for about 30 minutes, fiddling with gear, eating the last of our food, and slurping down the last of our meager water supply. I had finished the last of my water just below the summit had was very surprised that I wasn’t particularly thirsty. Day 6Now that everyone was fed and warm, we were ready to get moving again. Having reached the tree line seemed to have boosted morale. The worst was behind us and now it was just a matter of bushwhacking our way down to the trail. I had my GPS on but I wasn’t in a hurry to share the information I was getting from it. We were still just over 7000 feet. The trailhead was at 3500. It was almost midnight when we started down again. We had 2.4km to go but as we rapped down 30m at a time, we were covering the distance agonizingly slowly. After a couple of rappels we were able to walk down about 40 feet without the rope so we thought we were ‘out of the woods’ so to speak. Our optimism proved premature however when the terrain became quite steep again, requiring more rappels. Jason’s brand new rope was a mess. It had survived rock fall, tons of sand & dirt, and now tree sap. It was so dirty I couldn’t even find the middle markings on it now when I was setting up rap stations. Obviously a new rope would be added to the expense sheet at the end of the trip although Jason was still stubbornly refusing. We told him it wasn’t up for debate and he finally acquiesced. The forest got thicker and the footing became more solid. I had long ago lost count of rappels. I would estimate between 15 and 20 by the time we finally put the rope away for good. Soon we were embraced in the loving arms of slide alder. I’ve never seen alder so thick in my life. I had to put my poles away as I needed both hands just to swim through the stuff. This was the first time the darkness really felt oppressive. The going was still steep and uneven so it was a little unnerving to be crashing blindly through slide alder, not knowing if I was about to push through and find a cliff on the other side. The ground was covered in a good foot of alder and deadfall so that ever step involved crashing through dry wood and ankle wrenching branches. This was getting old very quickly so it was a serious relief when we finally came upon a long talus slope. The rocks stretched out as far as the eye could see which was much farther now that the moon had finally risen over the mountain and was providing a bit of light. Most of the rocks were pretty solid which was a nice change from the last stretch of rocks we’d endured. At one point there was a flat little patch of sand just slightly larger than my boot. I took a few moments to enjoy the feeling of flat, solid ground under my feet, alternating back and forth between left and right. I pointed it out to Mike so he could stand on it too. This was seriously the ONLY good footing we’d had since we left the top of Cannon and would be the last we’d see until we made it back down to the trail. Our talus slope dwindled and dumped us back into the steep forest again but we soon came upon a small stream. WATER! We quickly filled a 4L water bag, fished out some Gatorade powder, and Mike got to work on the temperamental MIOX. “Low Salt” it kept saying, over and over. He passed it to Tai, announcing that Tai had the magic touch but even the magical Tai could not make it work. I knew what everyone was thinking so I reminded them of the Giardia I had come home with from my last trip up here after I drank untreated water. It was decided then and there that MSR would be held accountable for this. It was to audible groans that Tai poured out the 4L of water, before we continued down the stream bed. Q was quite rightly suggesting that we needed a rest so at the very first place 6 people could sit down, we stopped for a nap. It was 5:30am and the sun was just starting to rise. It was extremely difficult to get comfortable since not one of the huge boulders we were sitting on was flat. Marian shared her sleeping pads with Q and Jason. I unrolled mine and found a spot where I could wedge my feet under a dead tree to keep me from slipping down the rock. I curled up, pulled my hat down over my eyes, and to my extreme surprise was dead to the world in about 2 seconds flat. I slept for a good solid 5 minutes before my body told me it was time to switch positions. I’ve never fallen asleep so quickly or slept so deeply in my life. I’m certain that those 5 minutes got me down the rest of the way without injury. The last 30 minutes before the power nap had been fraught with ankle turns at almost every step. For the first time I noticed that my fingers and hands were not working very well. Rolling up my sleeping pad was agonizing. Getting it into its stuff sack was even worse. Untwisting my poles was torture. Jason was having a similar experience, but was not going to let us go without getting a group shot of our little nap nest among the boulders. Amazingly, Jason had continued to document our entire descent which had contributed greatly to keeping us all from taking the experience or ourselves too seriously. If Jason was still taking pictures, everything must still be under control right? He’d put the camera away if we got into trouble. Just then, Jason got into a bit of trouble of his own. He was standing above me directing everyone into their places for the photo when suddenly he disappeared from view with a crash. The log he had been standing on had been too dry and weak to take his weight and had snapped, depositing him unceremoniously into the branches below. Of course his only concern was for his camera and it was several tense moments before I could get an answer out of him as to HIS condition. Surprisingly, he was unharmed. Even more surprisingly, neither was the camera which had managed to lodge itself in the only place a camera could safely lodge itself. It was light now and Mike laughed as he pointed out a grassy meadow about 100 feet from us. We’d been balancing our weary bodies on these hateful boulders when there’d been a meadow less than 10 minutes away. Ah well. Had we made it to the meadow, we probably would have been tempted to get more comfortable and it would have been harder to get moving again. As it was, my body had gone into some kind of semi paralytic state and it took a good 15 minutes before I was moving freely again. I staggered like a drunk down to the meadow which was really not much of a meadow. While Jason reconned north, I went south. South looked better so we moved off in that direction. It was relatively easy going for a while and we soon came upon more talus. We alternated between talus and forest before we finally heard the much anticipated sound of Mountaineer Creek. The trail ran parallel to the creek all the way from the trailhead to Colchuck Lake so we knew we were close. There was plenty of evidence of bear activity but being in a group of 6 meant that we were pretty safe as there has never been a documented bear attack on a group of more than 4. Even so, we made a point of making plenty of noise to let them know we were coming. The devils club proved slightly more difficult to avoid. We were almost within sight of the creek when Tai and his heavy pack tumbled off of a log we were scrambling over. One of the branches he’d been using for support had snapped under the weight, dropping him 4 feet to the ground but not before puncturing his shoulder and tearing a large chunk out of his thumb. He was obviously in pain and if Tai’s letting you see that he’s in pain, he’s hurt. I was more concerned about his wrenched shoulder than for his wounds at this point but he still seemed to have good mobility. Still, I wanted to empty his pack to reduce the strain on his shoulder. He was having none of that though. I had told him several times through the night that I really needed him to be straight with me when I asked him how he was doing and reminded him of this point again. He assured me that he was ok to carry his pack so after very temporarily patching up his gaping thumb, I helped him up and hoisted his pack up to him. He grimaced but took the weight and carried on. We were so close to the trailhead now I told him to just keep going when we got to the creek so I could patch him up properly back at the cars where we had clean water to clean his wounds with. What a trooper. Minutes later, we were at the trail. I dropped to my knees and kissed the ground. There are no words to express the feeling of being on flat, solid ground after 17 hours of the polar opposite. Tai, Q, Marian and Mike were off like a shot. I hobbled along as fast as my abused knees would take me and Jason seemed content to keep pace with me. In spite of the incredible adversity we’d endured, there was still a small part of me that didn’t want it to end. After about 30 minutes, the end was in sight. We must have looked pretty funny coming crashing out of the forest, filthy, scratched, bruised & exhausted at 8:45 in the morning. There were several groups preparing for departure at their cars. We’d been hiking for 23 hours, 17 of which had been the descent from Cannon. Thankfully, we had plenty of water waiting for us in the cars and it was consumed voraciously. Gear was sorted and loaded into the cars while I attended to the worst of Tai’s injuries. Marian’s car battery was dead but Tai had jumper cables so that was taken care of quickly. Soon 6 very dirty, smelly & slightly delirious hikers were back on the road, and headed for the Circle Y restaurant for a well deserved breakfast. Wow… I’m kind of surprised to be at the end of this trip report which has been my constant companion for the past 5 days. It’s a little sad really. As long as I was writing this, I’ve been able to keep myself in the head space of the trip but I guess it’s really over now. This was hands down the best trip of my life. The spectacular destination was only part of what made it so special. The way this team gelled and worked together was beyond my wildest expectations. I don’t think it’s even possible to put together a more complimentary mix of skills and personalities. The Northern Lights don’t have anything on the remarkable display of human spirit put on but this team. A special thank you to Jason who stepped up before we even left organizing gear and didn’t stop crossing t’s and dotting i’s until everyone was safely back at the cars. I am proud, and more than a little astonished at how well Jason and I worked together through this whole trip but particularly on the descent from Cannon Mountain. The muscle stiffness has abated. The cuts and scrapes have scabbed over. The bruises have turned that particularly ugly color bruises turn right before they start to fade. Soon the physical evidence of our adventure will be gone but I will never be the same again. This was one those rare experiences that has really touched me deeply. As tough as it was, I don’t regret a single moment. Thank you to everyone who made it possible. I can’t wait to start planning our next trip together!

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/liberty-ridge-the-word-of-the-trip-is-rock/946350,"Liberty Ridge, The Word of the Trip Is Rock!",2015-06-24,"Introduction ""I've always laughed when others have compared climbing to dancing. To me, climbing is more like a fist fight. Dancing is maybe something you do nice and safe at the crag or at the bouldering gym. Real climbing is miserable. You slug it out with the mountain and beat it into submission, or it beats you. Either way, you come down completely hammered, having given it your all."" I last had a chance to climb Mount Rainier's Liberty Ridge in Summer of 2012. An ill-fated trip, it was scuttled a few days before our departure by poor weather and a spousal veto on the part of my partner's wife. Can you really blame her? This year was to be different, of course. We managed to win the meteorological coin toss and I had my down-for-anything-Russian-secret-weapon-of-a-partner, Kirill by my side. From our perspective, the only thing standing between us and the summit was the ever present threat of too many and sustained, rowdy nights at the bar. Lucky for us we had plenty of “acclimation time” in Seattle before and after the climb, allowing us to concentrate more fully during our two days on the mountain. Conditions on the mountain were reported to be not so great. The previous winter had been a dry one, and the temperature was above average, melting out most of the route and making route finding through the crevasses difficult. In fact we actually found ourselves forced off of the normal route several times just to make it go. I think it is reasonably safe to say that the route was in late season condition. There was quite a bit of objective hazard, manifesting itself in the form of frequent and heavy rock fall. We had to move fast between protected areas, and be light enough on our feet to be able to jump out of the way if something big was coming down. The real challenge became strategizing and finding a way to manage the objective hazard, rather than technical difficulty. It turned out to be a perfect match to our chosen style of climbing. We opted for less equipment, making a couple of sacrifices in pursuit of a light kit. Most notably we carried only 8 oz of fuel, food for 2 days (which we could have stretched over 3), one sleeping bag, 3 ice screws, 2 pickets, and a 30m rope. We used everything that we brought, except for the tent and pickets, and needed nothing more. Mine and Kirill's packs weighed in at around 20 and 25 pounds, respectively, although I think the difference was mostly due to the fact that Kirill was carrying the whisky and several pounds of gourmet food. It was such a nice hike. Hi, my name's Jason. I took my pants off because it's hot out. We were dropped off at around 8 PM at White River by Kirill's brother Alexey and his partner Yian, who were planning to climb the DC route. Our plan was to go over the summit to meet them on the DC and descend to the car. Bored by the prospect of setting up camp at the trailhead, we made the quick hike in to the Glacier Basin Campground, which we arrived to shortly after nightfall. I foolishly started hiking in my soft shell pants, and stripped them off soon after. Despite it being dusk, it was still quite warm! Once at camp, we gorged on prosciutto and sushi and strewed our now soaking wet equipment in a hopeless attempt at drying it. Oh yeah, this isn't Colorado. We napped for a few hours before breaking camp along with our soggy gear at 2 AM. Winthrop Sunrise Curtis Ridge I don't have much to say about the approach to the Carbon, aside from we did a lot of hiking in the dark, followed by a beautiful sunrise on the Winthrop. The snow hadn't frozen overnight, and we were post holing well before sunrise. From Curtis Ridge we found it easy to get onto the Carbon Glacier. My only advice here is if it isn't a mellow talus slope when you look over the edge, lose elevation and try again. We found ourselves going down more often than not on the traverse. STAY LOW STAY LOW STAY LOW. There's some more beta for you. Now go have fun. Carbon Chaos Snow Bridge Charging The Carbon was beautiful and much more straight forward than we could have imagined. Once on it, we traversed straight out right to get out of a heavily crevassed section and then continued up a mellow slope, hopping an occasional crevasse before hiking up a short ice fall. From here we wove in and out of huge crevasses trending more to the right than left, before finally crossing a massive crevasse filled in by a rock fall debris field, and squaring up with the Liberty Cap Headwall. It hadn't felt real until now, and when it happened it happened quickly. We were eyeing the bergschrund for weaknesses when a massive boulder let loose on the upper slopes. It initially appeared to be small, but increased in size as it plummeted from the upper slopes of Liberty Wall, collecting snow and ice and increasing its spin with each bounce, so that it appeared in its final form, a great, sunlit, pinwheeling ball of death, and we were powerless, frozen in place by its awe. It skipped a few times before bouncing once more off of a serac and arcing into the air, a final beautiful display before it fell a full 1000 feet and cratered into the glacier. Its collision with which prompted a concussive shock and sent a wave of snow a full 60 feet into the air. It had landed far from us, but when I looked closely at the boulder, now set in an equally sized crater, I noticed a remarkable similarity to many other chunks of rock and ice strewn about the glacier. There were no fewer than 20 of them, and they were all around us. Large Crevasse #Pooping Shooting Gallery This was to set the tone for the rest of Liberty Ridge. The question was not, “Is there going to be rock fall?” It was, “Where is the rock fall going to be?” I remember standing there, turning to Kirill, and saying “We're probably going to get hit by some rocks. You ok with that?” We examined the main slope carefully, and within just a few minutes noticed enough activity to dissuade us from attacking the main slope head-on. We opted to instead surmount a small ice bulge on the far left and sneak in using a narrow 45 degree snow couloir, which is visible in the photo above. At the base, under shelter of the lip of the bergschrund, we stopped for a break and un-roped, preparing to sprint the remaining ~1500 feet to Thumb Rock. There was still plenty of rock fall on our route and we proceeded with much caution. Here we adopted a strategy of alternating fully concentrating on climbing and then watching the slope above as the other climber moved. This worked well, and we made good time with minimal exposure. As with all problems, as we ascended the slope it broke itself up into smaller pieces, and we managed to hop from one sheltered area to another,taking refuge under small overhung rock bands, as we worked our way up to the ridge. It was really more hiking than climbing, with the angle never going above 45 degrees and usually staying closer to 35, but we did our fair share of post holing. We sunk into the slush up to our knees at times, stopped only by the hard glacial ice below. I always struggle with the prospect of explaining the difficulties of ice climbing through 6-8” of slush, but there was some of that as well. Ultimately, we topped out at the Thumb Rock “Campsite” at around 2 PM, only to find a landscape void of any evidence of human passing. I remember thinking, “Sick, this is what it must have looked like on the first ascent!” Running the Gauntlet Thumb Rock had recently been swept by a rock slide, and the campsites with it. I had heard the rumors, but believed them to be sensationalized. I fully expected to find at least one intact site, but that was not the case. After an edgy afternoon nap, we went about the task of constructing a reasonably flat campsite out of a pile of unstable talus. The tower that had released the slide was still shedding small rocks every once in a while, and when they fell they skipped down the slope, echoing off of the thin blades of talus before landing just a few feet from us in camp. It kept us on our toes, and the Willis Wall added to the ambiance by releasing multiple large avalanches. What a place. It felt like the mountain was disintegrating around us, and it was. We both hoped that an overnight freeze would calm things down a bit. With that hope, we sank down into our two person bivy and waited for our 3 AM wake-up call. Carbon Sunrise It wasn't long before high winds moved in and we got a taste of how unpredictable weather can be on Rainier. At 2 AM the wind came in hard and threatened to tear away our single sleeping bag. We had spread it open and were using it quilt style, and when either of us would fall asleep their side of the bag would get torn off by the wind, sending the whole bag vertical, held down only by our four feet crammed into the toe box. After fighting with it for a while we managed to find a way to keep it down while we waited for the wind to calm down. It finally subsided to a reasonable level at around 5 AM and we got started. Thumb Rock Sunrise Day 2 of #Pooping  ""I was ready to pull and re-swing my bottom tool, looking slightly up when I saw two rocks in my periphery moving directly at me. It all happened lightning fast. I lunged to the right, throwing my body weight onto one crampon and my lightly placed ice tools. In the same instant I screamed “ROCK!” Another moment of terror later and both rocks sailed by with a terrifying fluttering hiss that you have to hear to really understand."" Dirty Ice Flinging Mud Traversing We set off from camp unroped at about 6 AM. Our route out of camp went right as the left and center variations were completely melted out. This forced us into a crevasse field and some good steep ice climbing to bypass the crevasses. There were 2 or 3 bulges of dirty, glacial AI2, starting with a short vertical step that we soloed. Neither of us thought twice about it, but I would have hated to try to put screws into that stuff. It was hard enough to get our picks to stick in it. We continued straight up before roping up for a few thin snow bridges and rejoined the route before transitioning into a leftward traverse below the black pyramid. Up until now the shelling from above had lulled, but as we rounded the corner we were confronted with a particularly bad slope. It was only about 40 degrees, but threatened by rockfall coming from a 40 foot vertical drop immediately above. It was absolutely littered with debris and we kicked steps in the rock that had piled up on the sun cupped snow. Several pieces were falling every minute, from baseball to mailbox in size, usually coming down in a big release and almost always coming down several deep runnels in the middle of the slope. Getting across the traverse ended up being a matter of putting your head down to the small pieces that were falling and moving quick enough to avoid a major release. We managed no major casualties across this slope aside from a rock that clipped my right leg and another that tagged my forearm. I didn't know it at the time, but the last one cut my arm. At least it didn't tear my jacket! Beyond this slope we found clean snow and relative safety, along with a glacial drip, and we took a second to have a break and load up on water. More Ice... By now we were in full sun, and had stripped back down to our base layers. We could see nothing but an endless snow slope above us and we knew we were close to the relative safety of Liberty Cap. Below us, the entirety of the Carbon Glacier welcomed us into its maw. The snow was thick and heavy, and accepted our legs up to our knees as payment for our progress, which we doled out in sullen silence. As we gained elevation the snow thinned and what once was a bomber self belay from an ice tool turned into a shallow pick placement. Wide, supportive kicked steps yielded to the occasional front point. Before long we were fully engaged on our front points and both tools, the dirty glacial ice streaming with the tears of its own destiny, us fighting against its pull, upwards towards our own. I've always laughed when others have compared climbing to dancing. To me, climbing is more like a fist fight. Dancing is maybe something you do nice and safe at the crag or at the bouldering gym. Real climbing is miserable. You slug it out with the mountain and beat it into submission, or it beats you. Either way, you come down completely hammered, having given it your all. I felt differently here though. I felt comfortable on the ice and stretched my tool placements shallow and far apart. Swing, kick, kick, kick, swing, kick, kick, kick, swing... I fell into the rhythm and felt like maybe this is what people meant when they talked about dancing. If there is anything close to it in the mountains, I was doing it right then. The more I moved, the more I noticed the texture of the ice and the tiny runnels that ran with melt water. The whole face was running. In all directions we were surrounded by a throbbing, shimmering, sheet of ice. With the melt water came the inevitable rock missiles from above. This time flying clear and left of us, but with surprising speed. I yelled to Kirill and silently hoped that he was below me and not off to the left. I immediately felt incredibly exposed. We were on a 50 degree ice slope that we now estimate to have been 1500 feet in length, with no terrain protection in sight. Liberty Ridge Ice I believe I would have preferred to continue soloing at this point, but we decided to rope up on a running belay as Kirill had acquired a mysterious knee injury and did not feel comfortable soloing on it. We didn't have many options here. Pitching out a face of this length with a 30m rope would be out of the question. Simul-climbing was our only option, but it would be done with runouts so big that the point was nearly negated. We alternated leading blocks, leading 4 rope lengths at a time as that is all that our 3 ice screws would allow. We belayed from our ice tools. Every 100 feet the leader placed one ice screw, keeping the team “anchored” to the mountain at all times. We climbed 3 simul-pitches and soloed another 400 feet of easier ice before reaching the ramp below our Liberty Cap exit. During our third simul-pitch we had our closest call of the trip. It was my lead, we were 200 feet into the pitch, and I was about to stop and place another ice screw. There had been no rock fall for a longtime, and we were both feeling relatively comfortable. The thought even crossed my mind to put my headphones back in. I was ready to pull and re-swing my bottom tool, looking slightly up when I saw two rocks in my periphery moving directly at me. It all happened lightning fast. I lunged to the right, throwing my body weight onto one crampon and my lightly placed ice tools. In the same instant I screamed “ROCK!” Another moment of terror later and both rocks sailed by with a terrifying fluttering hiss that you have to hear to really understand. One the size of an encyclopedia cartwheeled straight passed me, grazing over my left shoulder at what I can only guess must have been better than 100 mph. The other cleared me 20 feet to the left. The following moment I remember nothing but hyper awareness. I would have gladly accepted that the mountain sent down the rest of its debris in one volley as in the moment I was sure I could have handled it. I've felt it before, once leading a 150 foot ice pillar that fractured and shifted in response to a misplaced swing of an ice tool. It's the way you feel when your mind is convinced that you are going to die, and I didn't want it to end. Later, I craved it, and it has been the subject of much unrest in the days past. Back in the moment, I wasn't sure about where Kirill was. Loud, Russian accented expletives from below told me the story all at once. He wasn't hit, but we were both very excited to get off of this face.  Approaching Liberty Cap Time To Go For a Nice Walk Fortunately,this was to be our last rock fall incident of the day, and the rest of the route went smoothly. We continued up low angle ice, punctuated by the occasional patch of snow and took one last break below the ramp that accesses the crux of the route. I bonked pretty hard here and ate my last two gels at once to try and recover. Kirill was feeling good however and took off in the lead, alternating front pointing glacial ice and post holing in the slush. We roped up one last time at the exit, which was a short, well protected, bouldery move off of a fragile snow mushroom that collapsed as Kirill was following. It felt casual after the rest of the day, and I struggle with assigning a grade to it. How about “athletic” WI3-? Our rack of 3 screws ended up being perfect for it, as we actually got to have an ice screw for the belay, and Kirill climbed through, continuing to break trail up to the summit of Liberty Cap. Liberty Cap Penitentes Columbia Crest is in the distance. Rainier Summit Plateau We topped out sometime in the early afternoon, and stopped to brew up and eat “breakfast” which we had been threatening to do all day. We had expected to see some people over on Columbia Crest, but I suppose we were too late as all of the other parties had already descended. This part reminded me of my trip to Mount Logan last summer, wholly expecting to see other people on the summit and not seeing a soul on the entire descent. Kirill's knee was bothering him quite a bit by this point so we dialed back the pace a bit and did a rising traverse around the summit crater to link up with the DC. Neither of us had ever been on Rainier before, and we hadn't really researched the descent much, so it was quite the adventure. We simply used the GPS on my iPhone to find the right aspect of the summit crater and the wands for the DC took over from there. The weather had been deteriorating substantially, and some snow and graupel began to fall as we kicked on the autopilot and started the death march down the DC. The wanded route winds through crevasses. One of the ladders on the DC. Fun stuff! Crevasse POV The hike down the DC was absolutely stunning, and the large crevasses offered a convoluted maze that the well marked trench gave us a grand tour of. Around every corner I was absolutely blown away by the incredibly beautiful ice falls and crevasses that we were hiking through. The guide services do an excellent job at making it as user friendly as possible, and after a while we both felt comfortable with kicking off our crampons and trudging down in the slushy snow. Every major crevasse crossing had a fixed line over it, and many had ladders. Any area of even slight exposure had a fixed line. What a great way to walk off of a mountain! Relax, take in the beauty, and smell the roses. Or in our case, really bad smelling Capilene. I was excited to be finished, to the extent that we were not far from a beer, a hot meal, and a shower, but as we descended a part of me started to wither and die. I regretted each passing step off of the mountain, and as the sun began to set, I was sad to see the day go. We took our time, and as the sun gave up its last rays we made it into Camp Muir where several people were awaiting our arrival. “Hey, what camp is this?” I greeted them. “Uhhh Camp Muir?” (dubiously) They answered. Apparently they had watched us as we were descending from the summit crater and were concerned for our safety. We stopped for a quick break here to chat with the other mountaineers and Kirill popped into the ranger cabin to have his knee checked out. They were interested in what we had done, and I couldn't stop raving about how much we had enjoyed their mountain. After a quick exam, the consensus was that Kirill was fine to continue descending, so the rangers topped off our water (Thanks guys!) and we started the hike out to Paradise as others in camp were rousing for their summit attempt. We hiked out under a big, bright moon and reveled in the beauty of the place, even at night. We got out late and re-united with our friends in the dimly lit parking lot. The next day, Kirill came into possession of a pair of crutches. I walked badly for a week. A partial photosphere of the DC. Camp Muir Conclusion Over the next few days we got some rest and enjoyed the city of Seattle, the culture, and the company of our hosts, Alexey and Ursula, who so graciously opened their home to us. We had a great time. We drank wine, dined in fancy restaurants, toured around the city, and went for a swim on the coast, normal things that all people can appreciate. One of my favorite things about climbing mountains is enjoying the sights and people of a strange land, and in this respect I was delighted. Internally however, I struggled. Liberty Ridge had come too late for me. I didn't feel satisfied, and I toyed with the idea of returning to try and solo the route in a day or soloing The Price Glacier. I wanted to climb Curtis Ridge or one of the Grade V routes that overhang as you ice climb up the final serac wall. I wanted to roll the big dice, and I wanted to flip my mind inside out with fear and emotion. This prompted a whole other set of internal dialogue. When is enough? How thin do I have to draw the line? Do I actually have to be hit by the rock to feel satisfied? With the questioning came guilt, and I intentionally blew off my last possible day of climbing by staying out late with some locals. I rented a bicycle the following afternoon and pedaled down the ocean front, with the mountain clearly visible on the horizon and in the forefront of my mind. A heavily caffeinated day of introspecting later (oh yeah, the PNW really knows how to do espresso), and I had my answer. I want the fear, commitment, camaraderie, uncertainty, and drama that only a two month expedition to a dangerous mountain in the middle of nowhere can provide. I live in the shadow of Mount Logan. I boarded the plane home and didn’t even bother looking out of the window. I returned home in a daze, finally understanding what I want, although unsure of whether I can be selfish enough to reach out and take it. Images View Liberty Ridge, The Word of the Trip Is Rock!

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/death-looms-a-foot-away/988271,Death Looms A Foot Away,2016-11-01,"Introduction This trip was a mere foot or less from ending so differently from the terrific success that it did. It often is a reminder of how much one should cherish all of ther experiences and not take thing for granted. It is also a reminder that hiking and climbing has its inherit dangers even on the easiest of trails. Thankfully though, this was a great success and the near tragedy did not happen. This trip formed largely because I was getting very depressed over having a very poor summer. As some of you may know, my health is really beginning to fail me in many ways. I have been dramatically slowed from having constantly swollen feet to sleeping issues and serious weight gain linked to a serious case of hypothyroidism. On top of this, this was another very stressful summer working and the result was yet another summer let down. I look to be going into the winter having to accomplish the least amount of hikes and climbs since 2007, the year I moved to Washington State. Also, we had a very rainy October when I was finally going to get out and enjoy danger and you can see how frustrated I became. Add on that I took off three in November only to find out that they were going to be rainy as well,  and I flew out to California. So, on the last minute I decided to book myself a flight to Los Angeles with the goal of doing Mount San Antonio and whatever other peak I could find in the region. My friend, Josh Lewis,  was having a number of issues going on so I decided to bring him along as well. I figured I needed him due to the fact my health is not what it once was and I may need some help and encouragement along the way. Heading to California Golden Gate Bridge Josh and I met at the airport and took the flight to Ontario Airport. We decided to stay at a local hotel in the town of Mount Baldy in one of their cabins in order to get some altitude under our belt. The cabin was decent.  However, on the last night we had some issues but luckily the guy was willing to upgrade us so we were largely happy with the result. We brought a bunch of canned food from home and bought a lot of fresh fruit. Along with the occasional stops at ""In and Out"",  we were good to go the entire time we were in the mountains. The First Hike: Sunset Peak Sunset from Sunset Peak We decided to sleep late from the flight the day before. I was actually able to get a whole lot of sleep that night which helped me rest from the stresses of the summer months of not getting much rest. In fact, it took a lot just to get me from the bed. We did attempt a hike earlier in the day but with the warm Santa Ana winds we were only able to go so far without dealing with the sun beating down on us. Coming from Seattle which had the wettest October on record, we were not used to so much sun. So we waited until later in the day and then attempted Sunset Ridge in order to see a great sunset. At 3 pm we started up the direct East Ridge route. This route is starting to overgrow in places but is still a very good and scenic route to the summit. On occasion, we had to deal with the agave plants and scrambles here and there.  The Ridge Route up Sunset Once on the summit of Sunset Peak, we decided to wait it out on the mountain until the sun set over the horizon. One fellow hiker was from Colorado and the other was from nearby California. Talking to the both of them made the time fly on by as we realized that we got to the summit an hour and a half before sunset. Yes, I did talk about Summitpost.org and I am glad to say that we now have one more great Summitpost contributor. Looking down the valley Flowers on the summit Every thirty minutes, I took updated pictures of the surrounding San Gabriel mountains. It was great to see Mount San Antonio and Register Ridge with a nice sunset glow. After watching the stunning sunset,  we decided to attempt the same route we came up to head back. We soon realized with diminishing light, that this was a very bad idea. So, we merged onto the fire road and took the fire road all of the way back to the car. This road was long and very boring, but with headlamps it was easy to follow. Mount San Antonio during the sunset on from Sunset Peak Colver Peak during the sunset on from Sunset Peak It should be noted that the next day my foot swelled up again after the hike nullifying another hike the day after. So on that day we just relaxed and enjoyed a nice day at the resort while I soaked my leg in the cold pool to rest it up. That night we prepared ourselves for the entire reason why we came to California: Mount San Antonio. EastKing in the sunset                     The Main Event: San Antonio, West Baldy and Harwood Ascending to Our Goal Mount San Antonio before the sunset on from Sunset Peak We got up early that Friday morning and drove up to the trailhead. My foot was feeling better and we decided to do the famed Devil's Backbone Trail. This trail is well known for its narrow ridges and catwalks which especially held true just beyond the ski area. This trail up to the summit is very rewarding.  It has great views of most of the San Gabriels' as well as of the deserts to the north and the urban sprawl to the south. Devil's Backbone I especially liked crossing over the narrow ridges that the Devil's Backbone trail climbed over. One spicy section was the catwalk on Devil's backbone.  It isn't just the fact that it is a catwalk but the footing is not that great on it either. We took it slow across this section and continued toward the summit of Mount San Antonio. It would be later that we realized how dangerous this section really was. The trail then mellowed out once we got past the narrow ridges and catwalks. Soon,we could see Mount San Antonio coming into view. The altitude was having an affect on our speed but we were doing very well on our way to the summit. Once we got past the gap past Mount Harwood and San Antonio our pace slowed down dramatically. The thin air was having an impact on me largely because I have not been above 10000 feet in three years. But I fought through the thin air, and though the last 500 feet was slow we were on the summit and at first we had the summit to ourselves. Mount San Antonio from the trail The Three Summits EastKing on Mount San Antonio Josh Lewis on Mount San Antonio After goofing off on the summit of Mount San Antonio for a couple minutes we were soon greeted by a large number of hikers. After saying hello to them we quickly headed off the main summit over to the summit of West Baldy. Though it is 80 feet shorter, it looked from our vantage point that West Baldy was going to be more scenic than the true Baldy summit. West Baldy from Mount San Antonio We headed on over to West Baldy to see the better views. It turned out that we were correct and the views from the summit of West Baldy were very stunning as well. This time there was no one but us on the but us on the summit and we checked out future summits such as Baden-Powell and others. I only pray that I can maintain enough health to hit these mountains in the future. EastKing on West Baldy Josh Lewis on West Baldy After thirty minutes on West Baldy we then headed on over to Harwood. We had to go over San Antonio again. Luckily this time I was used to the altitude and travel was not nearly as slow as heading up the summit the first time. Once at San Antonio we sat up top for a full break where we made conversation with a number of very experienced climbers looking at going to Denali in the near future. They told us about a lot of great beta on different Mexican volcanoes which hope one day to hit in the future. The summit of Mount San Antonio The summit marker of Mount San Antonio Mount Harwood After our break we headed to Mount Harwood. Heading down to the gap was much easier than heading up and we were greeted with an excellent view of our next destination. Once in the gap we spotted a very small boot-path which rose to the top of the ridge. I was a little tired and slow here but the altitude was not affecting me as much as it was early in the trip. Once we were on the ridge we had some discussion on where the true summit was so we decided to stand on all the tall spots though we both thought that the eastern highpoint was the true summit. The views on Mount Harwood were very beautiful just like the summits of Mount San Antonio and West Baldy. The true summit of Mount Harwood Looking east from the true summit of Mount Harwood Like with West Baldy, and San Antonio we stood on summit for a good while before descending the scree field back to Devil's Backbone Trail. It looked at this point we were on our way down with another three summits. No drama right..... Josh heading down the scree field When it all could have changed Josh on Devil's Backbone Remember that I was talking about all of the catwalks and narrow ridges. In the back of my mind I kept sensing what was coming around the corner. Though I have been on hundreds of mountains in the past for some strange reason I was acting very sensitive heading back on this trip. As we got closer to the catwalk my nerves began to tighten. It was as if I had never been on a catwalk before. Josh on Devil's Backbone The narrow ridges were as easy as they were on up. But then came that catwalk with the loose footing. I let Josh go on ahead because he has been through a whole lot of steeps and rock climbs this year. He started on this like it was nothing because it was nothing to him and it should have been nothing to me. He then stopped to take a picture of me but I told him not to am to be very careful. About where Josh fell. Trust me this side slope was far steeper then it looked in the picture. Ten feet later, Josh's feet went out from the ground and I saw him up in mid air. It is strange but this split second felt like an eternity until he hit the ground. But where would hit the ground. Below him was very steep slope with a 30 foot or more cliff below that. With no trekking poles there would be nothing to stop if he started down the steep slope. My heart at this point skipped a beat. IS IT GOING TO END LIKE THIS???? Josh's body landed directly on the narrow loose trail. And though the section was angled for him to continue to the steep slope it was just flat enough that Josh was able to catch himself before he started the tumble to potentially his final 3 seconds of life. He quick got himself back on his feet, acted as nothing happened and let me know he was okay. Now it my turn with my trekking poles to make sure I did not fall myself. My nerves were on fire but slowly and carefully I made it through the loose catwalk. Once off the hardest part of the Devil's Backbone Trail we decided to head down to ski area and back to the car. Luckily there was no more drama and once we got to the car both of us felt the relief and happiness to get three more summits. The Rest of the TripOnce down from the mountain we decided to regretful stay down in the sprawl for the last night. We headed to Scandia Amusement Park to take what was left of our adrenalin out of us. The tower drop was closed but the rollercoaster was both open and a lot of fun. It was worth the money and we were happy to end this great day on a great note. Our final night was one the worst hotel experiences in my life due to a dirty room and a neighbor consistently partying and knocking on my door. The next day we were going to do another mountain but there was no parking for me to do that so we passed on the hike and headed to downtown LA to go up the highest building in downtown. There we rode down the open glass on the 70 floor. This slide was not all it was cracked up to be but at least we got to see downtown Los Angeles for the first time. After another stop at In and Out University we headed on our flight back to Washington after yet another successful trip. It ended as a great trip which is just what I needed while I am fighting a number of health ailments right now. But it was also a reminder on how quickly things can change even on the most popular trails. It is also a reminder on how quickly things can change in life and what is most important in life. Life is like climbing a mountain, success is not achieving the summit but the successful journey of getting there and back. Hopefully for me this will mean that I am back.

single-day,https://www.summitpost.org/mount-index-spring-2012/790016,Mount Index Spring 2012,2012-05-05,"Overview Mount IndexI have never really been too familiar with the Highway 2 area in terms of mountaineering. Residing in Skagit County, I have usually focused most of my attention on the North Cascades Highway, Mount Baker Highway and the Mountain Loop. So when SP's own Gimpilator contacted me with an ambitious plan for a 2 day assault on Mt. Index, I was curious to say the least. It turned out he and Redwic had made an attempt the previous June but timed out 1,100' short of the summit via the West Ridge, this year however, we assembled a crack team of ambitious locals with the common goal for a good mid Spring summit. Armed with much supplies, rations and first class route beta we met in Sultan around 7:30 before convoying to the Gate on FR 62, about 7 miles from its junction with highway 2. From camp Ascent Camp First view of our objective For this trip we had a fairly large crew, possibly the largest assembled group of competent mountaineers I have ever climbed with. Attempting the summit this trip was Gimplilator, Redwic, Greg, Ryan & Tyler a couple climbers from the Arlington area, Nate the man responsible for my first excursion to the sub alpine, and myself. We donned our packs amidst a cloudy, cold and relatively damp morning before setting off on our bicycles to the start of our climb, I believe all of us were surprised to see how low the snow level had fallen the previous night. After about six miles of pedaling we stashed our bikes and started up an old logging road spur that had succombed to the slow return of many Alder sapplings, although pretty slow going through the wet vegetation, I assume it would be far worse had the sapplings been covered in leaves, though Ryan and Tyler may disagree having chosen external frame packs. As the brush grew denser we rounded a couple switchbacks before the sapplings gave way to snow and we put on our snowshoes, at this point we recommended Greg stay at the rear of the team for he had neglected to bring snowhoes on this excursion. Crossing a couple snow gullys we left the road bed and started our ascent up sometimes 50 degree slopes taking turns breaking trail through the 12 inches of fresh snow. The going was slow with full packs in the light falling snow and dense fog, and roughly 2 hours after leaving the road bed we crossed under a beautiful cornice and descended on our camp at around 4,800' and a quarter mile south of the 4,900' ridge saddle. Set up Camp was assembled pretty quick and almost as quick the weather started to change for the better, we soon got our first view of our objective and felt a little better about the days journey. In an effort to speed up the next mornings travel Gimpilator, Redwic and myself decided to break a path from camp onto the ridge and maybe beyond that evening, we decided to maintain a level traverse on moderate forested slopes leading directly to the 4,900' saddle. At this point Gimpilator turned back while Redwic and myself continued another 200' up the ridgeline and got some neat views of camp. Returning back to camp, the seven of us prepared dinner, boiled water and told tales before getting to bed for an early start on the summit push, hopefully before avalanche conditions thwarted our effort. Summit First Light Gimpilator is excited! Breaking trail 4:30 came quick under clear skies and crisp air, we made a quick breakfast and hurried on to the saddle. Ascending the forested ridge went pretty quick and we were soon out of the trees and descending into a small col at the base of a 60 degree 90' tall slope. We discussed our options and decided to remove our snowshoes while Ryan broke a quick boot path up, a decision that proved to be great fun! From there Tyler and I took turns breaking a path to the summit with snowshoes while the others booted up behind, the views were really opening up by now and all of us were now free and clear, I am sure everyone was feeling great at this point. Ryans turn Summit Party Soon we were standing atop Mount Index! Naming peaks and soaking in the views we enjoyed as much as we could before accepting the fact that time was a major issue and quickly descended hoping to break camp and make it back to the road bed before the slopes warmed to a dangerous level. Looking SE from the Summit Views East Descent Descending the upper ridge went fairly quick and without incident and soon we were at camp all packed up and watching the tree bombs fall left and right. On our descent of the steep forested slopes above the roadbed we opted for bare boots and found conditions to be not too scary. We made quick work of the trek and returned to the roadbed to find a gully had let loose since we had crossed. As was the story for some other gullys on the upper roadbed but none proved much of a challenge. When reaching the sappling infested section I was delighted to remember how much easier travel was going downhill through this type of brush, for the most part traveling the same direction as the branch growth and far drier than the day before. We were soon at our bikes and moving at breakneck speeds down the gravel roads. Racing to the bottom of the last good hill I managed to puncture my rear tire and as a result watched the 6 of them slowly pedal off into the horizon, oops. Twenty minutes of walking and I was packing up my gear, bragging with my peers and making way for town. Truly a great trip with a great team, I do believe we could have had some of the more pleasant travel conditions in comparison to other parties attempts. Flat Tire, Oops LOST!If anybody decides to climb this peak, on our descent we lost an ice axe shortly above were you would stash the bikes. It's a Petzl with Orange covers, if you find it please contact me, thanks!

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/you-ll-die-if-you-fall-here-mount-constance/870057,You'll die if you fall here: Mount Constance,2012-09-16,"I have been staring at Mount Constance from my home town of Edmonds for well over 20 years. It was visible from the playground at my elementary school. For that reason it is one of my original inspirations, a visual infatuation of sorts. Since my mountaineering began, there has been the knowledge that one day I would climb this mountain. Part of the allure is the fact that the upper portion of the route is complex, exposed, and not well documented. An inspection of the topograph map reveals a baffling mess of confused jagged lines, densely packed and difficult to decipher. These accumulative conditions breed uncertainties, also known as adventure. Mount Constance seen from the East Greg, Dave and I started on the old washed-out road, aiming to camp at Lake Constance by nightfall. The washout itself was humungous. I could see why there are no plans for repair. As so often happens, the river changed its course, so the road was subsequently erased. Normally, the remainder of the road would make for a good bicycle ride approach, but Dave didn't have a bike so we walked the 3 miles beyond the washout. Mount Constance seen from the north The Lake Constance trail is an amazing bit of engineering. It rises 3350 feet in only 2 miles. About half way to the lake, it passes through a small basin where the creek runs underground. Above that, the trail weaves its way through a series of small cliff faces. Many parts of the trail are solid class 3 with roots for handholds and consequences for mistakes. The teal colored water of Lake Constance When we reached the lake, I was impressed by it's beauty. The water was teal colored and fish were jumping for bugs. We set up my tent, took our boots off to air out our feet, and filtered some water for the coming day. I forced myself to wait until 5pm before eating my burrito. Above The Lake Entering Avalanche Canyon The following morning we rose with the sun and scaled the talus slopes immediately north of the lake. We were entering the mouth of Avalanche Canyon, a deep gorge between the main peak of Mount Constance and a slightly lower peak called Inner Constance. This area is certainly a unique place on earth. It's nothing like the rest of the Olympics. There were cliffs rising over a thousand feet on both sides and the bottom of the gorge through which we had to pass was relatively narrow. Large rock pinnacles towered above us. There was a sense of grandeur here and simultaneously the realization that we are small creatures. Inside Avalanche Canyon Entering the North Chute We crossed talus, large and small, and then bypassed the South Chute entrance, ascending loose talus up to the mouth of the North Chute. These are the two main options for escape from Avalanche Canyon and access to the upper route-maze. Supposedly the South Chute is full of horrible scree, so we left that for the descent. But as it turned out, the North Chute is steeper, and although it's more solid than the South Chute underneath, the top of the rock in the gully is covered with kitty-litter. To make matters worse, it escalated from class 2 to class 4. We discovered better rock with less kitty-litter on the right side, where it gets steeper. Climbing on Kitty-Litter At the top of the north chute we crossed a narrow exposed ledge trending left. This is where the top of the south chute route comes in from the loose gully below. We scrambled north through a notch to a snowfield on the other side. The snow was hard, steep, and icy, so we used the moat for some protection, and followed that for a distance. Scrambling in moats can be tricky at times, especially when you come to a narrow section where the icy snow presses you against the rock wall. It's also important to beware of deep spots where carelessness could plunge you into the depths below the snow. We came to the end of the moat and stepped back onto the rock. Scrambling to a notch Beyond The Moat We crossed some loose slopes and came to some narrow crack ledges embedded in down-sloping exposed slabs. It's amazing how many ledges and cliffs there are on Mount Constance. As we discovered, once you're beyond the chutes, there's cliffs below you for the rest of the way. This knowledge weighed heavy on our minds. crack ledges on down-sloping slabs Greg was in the lead and he came to what looked like a bad spot. We assured him that it was probably the correct way to proceed. He slowly edged his way along and around an exposed corner with an overhang above. ""You'll die here"", he said. ""What?"" I asked, laughing nervously. ""You'll die here, if you fall"" He said it again, with a weird tone in his voice, ""You will die, if you fall here"" The Finger Traverse He was beginning the famous Finger Traverse, one of the most renowned route features in the Olympic Range. I had invited him on this trip at the last minute. He hadn't had any time for research or mental preparation. He'd never even heard of the Finger Traverse. The first time I had seen footage of this spot, I thought No F-ing Way!, but now, years later, here I was. [NOTE: Take a look at this photo from coonrads trip, which is much better than the one I got when we were there.] If you don't like exposure, it might give you the creeping horrors to watch your climbing partners scramble into the middle of a rock mouth which appears as if it could spit you out into the void at any second. But if you do like exposure, it's sort of fun. :) Honestly, it wasn't so bad. It's true that it's very exposed while foot placements are thin, but the horizontal handhold crack at the top is wide open, so we were able rely on that for the length of the traverse. Dave came along behind me and then we were all through it. Beyond the Finger Traverse we had to lose some elevation before continuing. Diagonal ledge visible (bottom right), scree slopes and summit pinnacle above Ascending Scree The remainder of the summit ridge was now visible. There was a sort of half-bowl feature below us which allowed access to a diagonal ramp. We scrambled around through the convexity and then crossed another loose slope to reach the diagonal ramp. The down-sloping ramp dissected a large cliff face and there was more loose rock to contend with, so we proceeded with caution. I used the wall on the left to get some reassuring hand-holds. At the top of the ramp we came to a large open slope below the summit pinnacle. We fought our way up through horrible scree until we came to a miniature headwall. Here we got back onto semi-solid rock and scrambled north until reaching the crest of a small ridge, which is adjacent to the 40 foot tall summit pinnacle, but separated by a deep chasm. It seemed strange, because we had thought we were near the end of the route, but the chasm between the ridge where we were and the prominent summit spire was deep and not crossable. Instead we had to scramble the ridge crest north beyond the the summit pinnacle and then come back around where it connected, out on the north face. Nearing the summit pinnacle Following the ridge adjacent to the summit pinnacle The exposure on the north face was breathtaking. 1700 feet straight down to a large snowfield. We could tell just from looking at the north side of the summit pinnacle, it was not a good option for climbing without a rope. We scrambled around to the east side of the spire. There were some tricky moves just to get onto the thing, but once we did, we found a safer 3rd class route up the east side of it. When I came to the summit I fulfilled a longstanding dream. And what an intense route! This was definitely my favorite climb of the year, and it wasn't over yet. For Dave and I, we had now stood together on the three highest peaks in the Olympic Range. Pretty damn good for a guy in his 60's! Sitting on the summit After a short break on top, we reversed our route to the bottom of the diagonal ramp. The scree was much more pleasant on the way down. From the base of the ramp we descended to the bottom of the half-bowl, rather than going back up towards the Finger Traverse. Dave said he thought it would be faster to cross the Terrible Traverse instead. This is another famous route feature, steep exposed snow with treacherous cliffs right below it. People have lost their lives there. I was nervous about the prospect. Thankfully as it turned out, this late in the season, the snow was melted back to slightly revealing a small ledge. We crossed the narrow exposed ledge right at the base of the steep icy snow. For some reason I was still apprehensive about what we might find around the next corner. It seemed like the snowfield we had bypassed in the moat might be a problem for us now that we were on a much lower route. Sometimes I hate being right... Inner Constance seen from the summit After following another series of ledges we came to the base of aforementioned snowfield. It barred the way, just as I had feared. We scrambled down into a vertical moat/gully adjacent to the snowfield and followed that up as far as we could, to where the snow made full contact with nearly vertical rock walls. There was no safe way proceed, although we did have some choices. We could try to cross the snow at it's narrowest point and get down onto a lower loose rocky slope, but this was surely not the standard route, and we had no idea where we might end up. It would probably turn out to be a dead-end. Alternatively, we could use our crampons and ice axes to climb straight up the 60 degree icy snow, but a mistake would be fatal. Not a good option. While Dave and I were discussing what we should do, trying to decide, Greg got onto the rock and free-solo climbed to a rocky perch above the snow. WTF! Dave and I were astounded. For a guy without any rock experience, Greg had made the free-solo look easy. Did he even know what he had just done? In truth it was not easy. All the handholds were sloper and the foot placements were smears, especially tough moves to do in mountaineering boots. Greg was the tallest of the three of us, so he had an unfair advantage in the crux move which was a stretch. Dave free climbing We couldn't afford to spend another hour backtracking to the Finger Traverse. If we did that, we would have to face the cliffy section of trail below the lake in complete darkness, with full packs. Without expressing it verbally, Dave and I looked at each other with the same thought, I guess we're going that way. Dave followed up, using his ice ax on the icy snow left of the crappy rock, getting some sloper holds with his right hand, a mixed climb of sorts. He had a hard time getting through the crux spot, which did nothing to inspire confidence in me. I decided to climb further to the right on pure rock. I ran into a difficult corner, it was necessary to get around it, but there were no footholds. Some of this rock felt like 5.8. The features were just small rounded bumps with depressions in between. None of the moves I made felt very trustworthy, and the open space loomed large behind me, a sickening thought. Absolute focus was necessary. After 30 feet of free-solo climbing we all came to where the moat was open, a welcome sight. Coming back to Avalanche Canyon Beyond the snowfield we scrambled back through the notch and then descended a very loose scree gully to some open slopes, further down on the east face. From there we passed through a col to the top of the South Chute, and more scree-skiing (screeing). Back in Avalanche Canyon I felt glad to be alive after the free-solo climbing. I believe sometimes in the mountains we are forced to make quick judgments and take some risk to avoid bigger hazards. Back at camp we packed up quickly and hit the trail hoping to make it out to the road before dark. This we did accomplish. We even made it most of the way to the washout before headlamps were necessary.

single-day,https://www.summitpost.org/the-tooth-the-mountain-lion/466082,The Tooth & the Mountain Lion,2007-07-13,"PrefaceI am sure that the following has lots of spelling/grammar errors, I did not read it over very carefully, and for this I am dearly sorry, but not sorry enough to make the corrections, corrections like the number of commas in a sentence such as this one, again I apologize. Introduction Alpental ski area and the sight of the encounter I made a weekend trip to Seattle from Eugene where I was currently spending the summer studying for the MCATs. The purpose of the trip was primarily for a friend’s wedding, but I knew I couldn’t visit Seattle without a little climbing trip. My friend Owen had to work Friday and I had to take a five hour practice test, so we wanted something close and easy and the Tooth was the perfect climb. Only about an hour drive from Seattle on I-90, the Tooth has a short approach and great climbing. Owen picked me up as soon as he got off work and we sped up to the mountains. We arrived at the Alpental parking lot a little after 5:30pm. We organized our gear deciding what we would and wouldn’t need. We each carried our climbing gear, camera, one nalgene, one snickers bar, a Cliff bar, and few other essentials. I decided on leaving my ice axe behind (it was July), but it was a decision I would later regret. The Climb What the trail looked like much of the way. The amazing waterfall we ran into We started on the trail at about 6:00pm. We decided to take the trail that leads directly to Source Lk. and then head directly up to the Tooth from there. This sounded like a good plan seeing as how it was our decent route last time we climbed the peak in early May. However, the trail was far different than it was a few months ago. The snow that had made the path so easy to follow was gone and we were left playing a guessing game fairly early in the hike as to which lightly worn path was the trail. I ended up loosing the game somewhere along the way. It didn’t take long to realize “I was WAY OFF!” We ended up making our own way through the trees and shrubs. We didn’t mind too much, we never felt completely lost because the bowl-like valley is fairly easy to navigate in and we had a good idea of where the Tooth was. After crossing a number of small creeks we came to a much larger one with a couple amazing waterfalls, sometimes getting lost is awesome! It was obvious we were not going to cross this, so we headed up the hill. I expected to find the lake at least in sight, but found nothing. I was getting a little angry that the path was not where it should have been, although I suppose maybe it was I who was not where I should have been, but I’ll still blame the path. I wasn’t too familiar with the lake or how big it really was so I figured that we should probably starting heading up the ridge. Owen agreed and we began our ascent up the middle of a rocky creek which soon led us to the talus field. Now we knew where we were and the Tooth was in sight. For the next 45 minutes we navigated the shifting boulders of the talus field up to Pineapple Pass. I felt the blister on my heel that had been forming for a while getting worse as we climbed up the ridge. I knew I’d have to do something about that later. Owen hanging out with a swarm of mosquitoes below the talus field Once we reached the top of the ridge I noticed Owen had done a little route finding of his own. He was taking a ""short-cut” over some rocky outcropping. I followed, thinking he had taken this “route” before. When I got to the top he looked somewhat confused as to which way to go. “Which way did you go last time?” I asked. Owen then informed me he hadn’t ever gone that way before. While he attempted down-climbing the other side of the outcropping he noticed a loose rock and warned me he was going to kick it down. The rock was a little bigger than I thought and it tumbled a whole lot further than either of us thought. It tumbled down causing others rocks to fall for a good 15 seconds. I yelled “ROCKS!!”, as if anybody else was around. I decided to climb up further and look for a better down-climb, and found one which led directly to the base of the actual climb. We arrived at the base of the route at 8pm (a little late). We quickly put on our climbing gear and grabbed our cameras. I took off my sweat soaked shirt and put on a long sleeve. It was clear that the mosquitoes that plagued us during our bushwhacking were still here. There was literally a swarm around our heads. We both were spitting them out of our mouths and grabbing them out of our eyelashes. I quickly took off my boots to put on my climbing shoes (I don’t know why we used climbing shoes, you don’t really need them). However, in the process of pulling my boot I also pulled the skin off my forming blister. After a moment of pain I put my climbing shoes on which rubbed directly on the blister spot. Owen and I started up the climb a little after 8pm. Because nobody else was on the route the climb went fast. We reached the summit in half an hour. I took a few pictures of the sunset and the surrounding views, but we knew we had to get down fast. Owen set the rappel up while I took a few more pictures of Rainer. We got back down in 20 minutes, it was now 9pm. We had only 30 minutes of light left. Mt. Rainier from the summit My inspiring summit pose and potential last picture of me We still were unsure about which decent route to take, the way we had come (which was trailess), or to head back via the ridge line and down the Alpental ski runs. We decided on the latter because we figured we would have light longer by staying out of the forest and it would easier get a sense of where we were based on the surrounding peaks. By 9:30 it was completely dark and we were left with just the beams from our headlamps to guide our way. We both agreed the route was faster and we were happy with our decision. We soon arrived near the top of the Alpental ski slope, which was now just a steep, dark, dangerous, rocky slope. It took a lot of energy to controllably navigate our way down the slope without creating mini rockslides. With just a beam of light to look at our next step our peripheral was hindered quite a bit which made for some interesting balancing acts across a few of the boulders. We took a few more breaks every hundred yards or so to rest our legs. We finished off the rest of our water thinking we’d be down at the car pretty soon. We continued on, slowly inching down the rocky slope with our headlamps lighting the way. Enter The LionThe slope became more gradual and I arrived at a much flatter area. Owen was a little behind me and as I waited for him I surveyed our surroundings to find the best way to continue. While looking around, my headlamp lit up two shiny objects on a small ridge about 40 yards away. I quickly recognized the objects and eyes. Something was watching us! I quietly yelled to Owen, “Owen, do you see that?” and after looking at where my light was pointing, he replied, “Uh, yeah.” While having a guess as to what it was I still asked Owen what he thought. He replied with an optimistic answer, “Maybe it’s a coyote.” I pointed out the size of the eyes and how far apart they were, and that it was most definitely not a coyote. Owen asked for my opinion and I replied, “I’m going to be honest, don’t freak out, I think it's a mountain lion.” “AAaahh,” Owen replied as if intrigued. He seemed much more confident about our situation than I was. I was upset with our situation to say least. I was questioning the meaning of life and thinking about all the mountains I still hadn’t climbed. ----Before I continue I would also like to thank Jake Buter for the conversations we shared at Blakely Island last summer. I had a few conversations with Jake about the best thing to do if attacked by a mountain lion. One of Jake's proposals included jumping into water because cats hate water. Jake is a very smart person and any idea put forth by Jake should definitely be considered. However, after noting the lack of water in our situation I considered my own plan, which included shoving my hand down the lions throat and trying to gag it and grab the uvula (the dangling thing in the back of the throat)! I mean if something was reaching down my throat I'd sure let go. Many people HAVE pointed out to me the danger involved in reaching into a mountain lion's mouth, however, I'd rather be armless than lifeless. But thanks to Jake I had at least considered plans for this exact situation (minus the nighttime aspect)----- Owen and I stayed calm, kind of. We knew we had to make ourselves look big and intimidating. I regretted not having brought my ice axe along, but I pulled out the next best thing, my 4” lock-blade, yeah I’m a badass I know. Now some people may prefer a pistol, but having seen a number of Steven Seagal movies I know what a knife is capable of and felt comfortable in my abilities...or not. We then raised our sticks, which we had previously found and used for trekking poles, and we yelled whatever came to mind. We also thought it would be a good idea to run at the two glowing eyes, just a little. So we ran about 10 yards towards it while yelling and waving our weapons. It seemed as though we had gained a quick victory. Likely caught off guard by our antics…and my knife, of course, the eyes seemed to retreat a few steps. Thinking we were safe and no longer an object of interest for the lion, Owen and I felt relieved. However, the devilish creature turned towards us again and the eyes continued to watch us. We then realized that maybe the mountain lion was not going to quit so easily. We picked up a few rocks and hurled them at the beast, but it remained unmoving. My mind was racing with what to do next before this thing made a move of its own. Owen spotted a maintenance shed that we could break into and stay in overnight, but the shed was at an angle such that it would require us moving somewhat closer to the mountain lion. I told Owen I didn’t want to risk it and I rather get down the slope, besides I had to attend Chris and Annie’s wedding the next day. “We could make a run for it,” Owen said. But I quickly replied with, “No way.” If we ran I was sure it would be on us in 5 seconds and we were still at least a quarter mile from the lodge. As the eyes watched us, we watched them. They would occasionally disappear as the animal turned its head and our lights no longer reflected. We would yell in order to make it look back at us. It’s funny, as long as we could see the eyes we felt comfortable, but when they turned away we started to freak-out thinking the mountain lion was up to something. There were a few occasions when the eyes seemed to get a little closer, again we would yell to make the animal think twice. I was happy for Owen, he seemed confident, telling me he was going to rip the animal’s head off. Who was I to tell him he was an idiot and the animal would likely rip right through our necks with its teeth leaving us as bloody heaps on the rocks. I didn’t want to be Debbie Downer, so I said nothing. The best plan I could come up with was to stab Owen in the leg and take off. But then I decided God would never forgive me for that and neither would anybody else, besides Owen had the keys somewhere in his pack. I think if I’d had asked him where the keys were in his pack, he would know what I was up to. Once again it looked as if the mountain lion was getting closer as the eyes seemed to be coming down the ridge it was on. I remember yelling some profanities while trying to communicate to Owen, “Oh DEAR LORD IT’S COMING, GET READY!!” We braced ourselves with a knife and stick ready in hand, or in Owen’s case a rock and stick. We were ready for whatever was going to happen. If it attacked we would give the lion our back, which was protected by our backpack, and protect our necks as best as possible, the other would then do their best to fight off the beast, as well as the urge to run. The lion kept its distance, and the glowing eyes didn’t get any closer. We knew it was just waiting until we turned our backs. Owen was able to catch a glimpse of the creature’s outline and confirmed it as a mountain lion, definitely not a coyote, or a marmot with a major case of gigantism. It was time to do something we thought. I told Owen to walk 20 feet down the slope while I watched the eyes. When he reached the distance I told him to keep watch while I came to him. We continued this as under-control as possible. We didn’t want it to sound like we were running. We both tried to keep watch on the eyes as best as possible as we continued down the slope. Our route down the slope wasn’t so careful anymore. It now became a B-line for the lights of Alpental lodge. As we got further from where the eyes first appeared bushes got in the way and we could no longer tell whether the eyes were moving or not. Things got a little more exciting as we had no idea if this thing was following us or not, and if it was, where it was coming from. It would be impossible to hear it over our own heavy breathing, and because of the fact it's a cat, and cats are quiet. The person in charge of watching scanned the ridge line and surrounding areas for the glowing eyes. The adrenaline was rushing to the point I could not control the shaking of my leg, it was elvis-leg x10. No matter how hard I tried to keep my leg still it seemed to shake harder and faster. Our new path down the mountain took us through shrubs and thorn bushes. Our attention to shifting rocks and slick branches was no longer, as now we were solely focused on our surroundings. We were constantly falling over the rocks and getting caught by sharp thorns. The distance between us got bigger as the person in front searched for a good area to stop, an area that was open and provided at least some sense of what was around us. I decided to shut my knife blade because falling on it might not be so great. We tried to stay close together, but it got tough when all we had where headlamps and were surrounded by bushes with a mountain lion near by. On two different occasions I was fairly certain that I saw the pair of glowing eyes around the areas that we had come from. It seemed as though the mountain lion was indeed following us. I told Owen and we agreed that we needed to get down faster. We continued our hasty-under-control descent until the lodge was only a hundred yards away. The lights from the lodge lit the rest of the way. Still not turning our backs, we continued scanning the slope and the bushes for any sign of the lion. We finally arrived at the lodge. Rap music was playing, and once again we agreed (we agreed on a lot of things) that rap music never sounded so good. We rested in the safety of the lights and took a few pictures because that’s what you do after surviving a threat from a mountain lion. We then finished the walk back across the parking lot. Owen seemed fairly calm, but I was still scanning the bushes for glowing eyes. Then there it was, those eyes again, I told Owen, but he assured me that my mind was playing tricks on me. I refused to take my eyes off the bushes while I unloaded my pack in the truck. I quickly got in the car still looking around in the bushes. I told Owen to drive over to the place where I thought I had seen the eyes. Turns out it was just a reflector that time. We both laughed and drove back to Seattle. ConclusionWe decided we needed to celebrate our survival. We stopped at QFC in Issaquah. Owen bought an Odwalla and I bought Gatorade and JUICE!! We must have looked like idiots in the store because both of us still had our headlamps on. This concludes the most exciting night of our lives. Now I admit, I am not a mountain lion expert. I don’t know for sure if it was following us or not. I do not know their behavior, in all likelihood it was just curious about the two beams of light descending from higher on the mountain. But it was a very exciting night, perhaps the most exciting in my life and I was scared. But then again, isn’t that the purpose of the flight-of-fight response, to scare you into overreacting and saving yourself? I realize hiking at night is not the best idea, and that perhaps an early start would have been better. But I’ve done less smart things in my life.

Our joke is I will need to grab his backcountry pistol (because I was serious solder in my youngers years) and shoot the animal in a very short amount of time (because he will freeze up in fear). Cascadian - Nov 25, 2008 1:00 pm - Hasn't voted thanks I will try and post pictures. I wasn't all that sure how to, it seemed that SP didn't have the normal browse-computer-system-for-picture-thing. I shall be more diligent in my quest this time. Yes, and I have no pictures of the lion, although one of my plans was to pull my DSLR from my pack and use the flash to blind the animal, but I didn't want to bend over and make myself any smaller. This has not been posted elsewhere, and never before on SP. I wonder if Owen posted a story, haha. And I never really told Owen about my plan. Actually, come to think of it, I'm not sure if Owen and I have climbed together since then, haha. Oh God, I think he hates me! vancouver islander - Nov 25, 2008 2:59 pm - Voted 10/10 Pictures ...that's all it needed. Great - 10/10.

I live in serious bear country, and I am always looking for those reflections when hiking at night. Shared your excitement well. Glad you did not end up cutting Owen, you would have had to walk home. jharrwyo - Nov 30, 2008 4:10 pm - Hasn't voted good stuff Funnier than hell. I suppose the critter was just curious at first and after watching you guys trip over rocks and thorns was probably entertained. I've heard outfitters in bear country say grizzlies will follow their pack strings up the trail day and night just out of curiosity.

single-day,https://www.summitpost.org/sw-face-of-the-tooth/487315,SW face of the Tooth,2009-02-05,"What to climb...After Chico (cascadian) moved back up here to Washington from California, we decided it was time for a climb. We had lofty ideas of what a good climb would be, but a small weather window allowed us only part of a day. So, we decided on the SW face of the tooth... close to home, quick approach and a route we hadn't done yet. Throw in the fact that it's winter and we figured the route would provide an interesting outing! a traverse on our climb 5:45 amIt is far too early to get up and my body tells me to go back to bed. Somehow I get up (having slept maybe 2 hours) and put on some clothes and drive to meet Chico in Issaquah. We meet and head up to the pass talking about climbing and med school and more climbing. When we arrive at the trailhead, we pack our bags and head out quickly as we want to avoid afternoon avy danger. We leave the car and hit the trail at 8:00 am. The approach Chico crossing a snowfield at sunrise I haven't been on this approach since the summer, where you still have to walk around the north side of the valley. But it's winter now so the approach is a mile shorter and doesn't involve a mile of talus hopping. The only real difficulty we had was getting up the snow gully into Great Scott's Basin. The gully was full of soft snow and moats. But a tiring slog got us to the top within a half and hour and we were able to cruise up the basin to pineapple pass. From the basin to the base of the climb there were no difficulties and we made quick time. There are 3 dihedrals that make up the SW face of the tooth and we originally planned on climbing the normal route that goes up the third and farthest north one. But when we got to the first dihedral we saw some gear on a sling up the first dihedral. We thought about rapping the SW face to get the gear but upon inspection of the third dihedral we realized there was enough snow that the first pitch would only be about 10 meters long. So we went back to first dihedral and started up towards the gear. The climbBefore Chico started climbing, he pulled out of his pack the wonderful ski suit we designated as his ""winter alpine suite."" As soon as it came out of his pack I knew today could only be a great day! Chico started up the first pitch while I belayed off a solid nut and a picket. He made quick progress up the open book until it split into two more dihedrals, one goes left and one right. He took the right option as it led to the gear. This turned out to be a tough climb since he stayed in the corner clipping a fixed pin (I climbed right onto the face before the fixed pin and it was easy climbing 5.2 at most). When Chico got to the gear, he hollered down with joy, ""WOOO HOOO!!!"" As It turned out, the gear we had seen was a fully equalized 3 point anchor with a #1 camalot, a#2 camalot, a #6 hex, a brand new cordelette and 5 large lockers in perfect condition. It looked like someone had just left the gear right before we got there. Excited, I took down the belay and climbed up to see what we found. Upon arrival at the belay station, I looked down and realized that 15' below us, and to the left, was the gear we had originally seen when first looking up the dihedral! There were 2 more large lockers, another cordelette and a quickdraw clipped onto a bolt someone had placed for some unknown reason. We decided we'd finish the climb and come back around, scramble up and clean that gear later. Excited about our find, I led out on the second pitch climbing directly above the belay into sketchy and almost unprotectable climbing. 10' off the belay I had to aid on a #4 nut to get to a stance were I could place my first piece of weight bearing gear. All the climbing up to the aid piece was very tenuous and exposed! Above my first good piece of gear I clawed my way up unprotectable and mossy slabs and corners until I reached a tree with slings around it to belay off. I would rate this section of the climb nothing more than awkward 5.6 (especially with boots) but very dirty and loose. Chico quickly came up commenting on how much he loved the pitch because it was so sketchy. Chico following the sketchy second pitch I said I hated it. Chico leading the long traverse The next pitch was Chico's and we decided that we should traverse under a big roof to where the normal route goes. He took the gear and led out on a 50 meter traverse pitch that involved great exposure and fun climbing with a crux in the middle of a 15' leftward trending crack. He climbed into an nice looking dihedral with pitons and slings going up it, but retreated as the climbing was much too tough to go free. Instead he climbed a ramp down and left traversing even farther and making one sketchy move to a solid belay. This was the best climbing of the day. I'd say the leftward trending crack was 5.6, the rest 4th class to maybe 5.2 with great exposure and solid rock. The downclimb at the end was exciting as there was no way to protect it, so seconding added some spice! At the end of this pitch we were still not all the way over to the normal route. Chico finishing the long traverse I led out on the fourth pitch inspired by Chico's fun lead, directly into strenuous and unprotectable climbing. For the first 30' off the belay the climbing was considerably more sustained and hard to protect. Looking down after the hard section on the 4th pitch I Was able to get a crappy cam in 6' off the belay, in lose rock, and that was it. After 30' the difficulties ended and 4th class scrambling led me up towards an overhanging corner (below the catwalk) with a blank slab (or so I thought it was blank) on the right. After looking at my options 50' below the overhang, I decided to examine the overhanging corner as the climbing up to it looked easy. Climbing up to the corner I could see a nice crack appearing that looked like it would go, possibly free, but maybe with some help if necessary. To make a long story short, I got in a sketchy cam right at the base of the overhang and was able to climb up about 8 feet easily with decent holds and stemming. The next part looked and was much more difficult. I was able to get a nut placement in, sling it with a long sling and stand in it. Above this stance, about 10' up was a big ledge before an easy scramble to the base of the catwalk. 4' above the piece I had aided off, I was stemming and reaching for a nice handjam when my left foot popped off the miniscule hold it was on. ""FALLLLLLING!"" The next few seconds were a blur to me. All I remember is yelling something, floating through the air, jerking to a semi-stop, hearing rock exploding, falling some more, finally hitting the slab below me and sliding down it 10-15 feet. I came to a stop with a hot sensation in my right ankle and quickly found something to stand on with my left foot, and making sure I could move my ankle. It moved in all direction, but didn't feel great. ""Chico, I think I just sprained my ankle!"" His response was what most people would probably say, ""um... uh... ok. Are you alright?"" I had him lower me 10' to a large flake that I slung and anchored into. We decided that I would bring Chico up so he could clean the 3.5 friend that held my fall and downclimb back to me. The nut I had aided off of made the rock explode when I fell onto it, braking completely out of the crack. As I was taking him up, I noticed that there was a small 4th class ledge system cutting across the slab to my right which would lead to easier terrain above. I had just taken a 20+ foot fall on a hard overhanging corner when I could have easily traversed right on easy terrain... where I fell... click on the image to see what the dots mean Chico coming up after I fell... it was a faily exposed place to fall! As Chico arrived at the belay, we re-racked and started looking at our options. My ankle didn't feel great but it also wasn't too bad. I could stand on the inside of my foot but not on the outside. The obvious first option was to rappel the route we had just climbed. Another option was to have Chico check out the 4th class ledges to see if they would lead to the normal south face route where were could rap off. And the final and obviously terrible option was to have chico attempt the overhanging crack. We went with the second option as I just wanted to get to a place were I could sit down and look at my ankle without having to be leaning off an anchor. Chico led out on the traverse and 50' later he was at a tree belaying me over. The climbing was SO easy I couldn't believe it. I had completely overlooked the ledge system because I couldn't see it from below. After arriving at the tree belay I took a seat and checked out my ankle which seemed to be doing just fine. We were halfway up the 3rd pitch scramble of the normal south face route. The descent Since we'd both been to the summit so many times, we skipped making the climb to the top in favor of getting me down and out, just in case my ankle started to hurt more. rappelling off the south face The downclimb to the rappel anchors was uneventful as I rappelled and Chico kicked steps down steep snow. From there it was 2 rappels to the base of the south face where we decided to go back around to the southwest face to pick up the other gear we had seen left on the face. Within a few minutes Chico had scrambled up to the gear and added to the booty collection from the day. All in all, the gear we collected totaled over $350!!! Rappelling down the normal rappel gully was interesting as there was a large overhanging cornice to deal with. There was a space on the left to fit through so we attempted to rappel through it. Chico made it down and to a safe zone away from the path of any collapsing cornices. As he was rappelling the rope got caught in the snow and had cut in a few inches. Just in case, I had Chico try to pull part of the rope down to make sure we could recover it... it didn't budge. Just as I was about to let him pull the rope and walk around to the normal approach gully, I found a large horn I could sling with a humongous cordelette we found (25' of 9mm perlon). It called for an awkward start for a rappel, especially with a bum right foot, but worked well enough that I never had to actually climb under the overhanging cornice of doom (it was at least 5-7' overhung. After this, the downclimb and hike out was very uneventful except that I had ""limp plunge step"" steep snow. We reached the car at the trailhead and hour and a half after getting the last of the gear off the mountain. 2 days afterMy ankle has swollen up and hurts bad enough that I can't walk on it. I went into the doctor to have it examined and they don't think it is broken... so far. They said we'd really know in a week if it doesn't start getting better. It turns out I've sprained the deltoid ligament on my right foot. Unfortunately fractures often accompany sprains of the deltoid... :( Anyway, I'm walking around with crutches and a leg brace for the time being. the friend that held my fall, my consolation prize for falling and the nut that popped halfway though my fall I've had plenty of time to think about what happened. And I've replayed the incident in my head too many times. I'm lucky I didn't break it... that would have been a long and painful night of self rescue. Good thing I had spent the past month reviewing self rescue! I almost got to use those skills! I plan on finishing the route I attempted in the summer or spring with rock shoes. I think that the overhanging corner would go at 5.9+... maybe a bit easier if dry, but definitely doable in rock shoes. We'll see when the time comes and my ankle heals. Until then, I'll spend a lot of time looking at EVERYTHING new on summitpost and dreaming of the day I can climb again. 3 days after the fall... Somehow I can put weight on my ankle and almost walk. I can't bend it inward or up too much, but it seems to be doing much better than myself, or the doctors would have expected. It feels good to use is and be somewhat mobile! Random InfoRoute: I created a SW face 1st dihedral variation page... but here is a quick rundown for those of you who want the quick version! SW face variation ... P1- climbed the first dihedral (rather than the 3rd like most people do) 20m taking a right up a corner with a fixed pin to a good belay ledge 15 feet above, 5.5 if you move right onto the face after the fixed pin... harder if you stay in the corner. P2 - Climb directly above the belay on hard to protect and exposed moves to a dirty and hard to protect slab to a good belay tree 20m 5.6. P3 - Traverse left 50+ meters going over many ribs until you reach a vertical wall with a leftward slanting crack which protects well and is fun climbing. Climb the crack and keep traversing into a large open book with a fixed pin with a sling on it. Climb up high enough to access a ramp on the left wall you can downclimb to reach a belay around the rib 5' up, 5.6. P4 - climb up and left of the belay on strenuous hard to protect rock until you reach 4th class terrain trending slightly rightward until 30' below and overhanging corner. Before reaching the corner, move right across what looks like a featureless slab on thin 4th class ledges to a small tree just above a patch of trees, 5.7. P5 and 6 - follow the normal south face route to the summit, 4th class. Gear: Friends 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 (#3.5 was very useful in many situations) Set of nuts Some hexes 9 Single slings (less if you want to climb shorter pitches) 3 double slings (more if you tend to create rope drag but we didn't end up needing more) helmet, harness etc. Images View SW face of the Tooth Image Gallery - 10 Images Comments Post a Comment Viewing: 1-12 of 12 jordansahls - Feb 7, 2009 10:48 pm - Voted 10/10 At least its winter time...

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/ptarmigan-traverse-june-2015/945299,"Ptarmigan Traverse, June 2015",2015-06-01,"Intro Did this trip as a fairly large group, started with 10 people.  We had largely been a group of rock climbers, this was our first try at alpine mountaineering.  We significantly overloaded ourselves with rock pro and ice/snow pro, thinking we were going to be spending lots of time approaching the route as we usually approached trad routes on rock.  We also brought along the usual cold weather gear that one would bring, even though the weather report was hot and dry all the way through the trip.  We started out with packs from 75-88 lbs depending on how much the individual had invested in lightweight clothing/sleeping gear.   We had planned for 6 days of walking and 2 extra days for weather or rest days.  Ended up using both extra days as rest days due to some incidents, and used all the other 6 days walking for a total of 8.  Due to the weights of our gear and a lack of confidence working on steep snow, we used up 9-12 hours a day just getting from one bivouac site to the next, so we never even got to use all the rock gear we brought to climb anything while we were our there.  However, the clear weather gave us some amazing views and it was a great trip overall.  Lots of hard work, but the best mountain scenery I've encountered so far. Day 1Day one we drove, parked at Johannesburg parking lot, and got on the trail around 2pm.  It was a straightforward walk uphill to get to the first bivouac site we had planned, which was one of the national park backcountry camp sites at cascade pass. Cascade Pass Day 2 Day 2 we made sure we all could self arrest with our packs on, using the snowfields lower in cascade pass and then headed out towards cache col.  We got sidetracked on a climbers trail heading up to Johannesburg, so we traversed across towards cache col quite a bit too high and it was some slow going across the steep snow.  We got to Cache glacier, spent a bit to get roped up for glacier travel, although the glacier was pretty open and the crevasses we could see were maybe 6-8 inches wide at most, just cracks.  Being our first ever glacier crossing, we decided to rope up anyway.  Pack weight was already a noticeable issue by the time we made it to the top of cache col.  The walk down to Kool Aid lake was not hard, descents were generally awkward with the heavy packs and there often wasn't quite enough snow to glissade thanks to a very light winter here in Washington. Cache Glacier and Col Ascending Cache Glacier Sahale from Cache Col Day 3This morning one of our members was feeling very sick, threw up a few times.  We discussed waiting it out one day, but given that he couldn't keep food or water down, and it was extremely hot this week, we decided that he would not be able to hydrate adequately to survive the next 5 days in good condition.  We decided to have 3 others break up his gear, move him back to the Johannesburg parking lot to drive home.  The other 3 would rest overnight at the parking lot, then come back to kool aid lake the next day.  This worked out in favor of the sick guy, but it would later prove to have been a potential downfall for another member of our party.  Those of us that stayed at Kool Aid made an attempt at Hurry Up Peak and worked on some of our crevasse rescue skills and took pictures while we waited. Johannesburg Mountain during the day at Kool Aid Lake Bivy At Kool Aid Lake Arts Knoll and Mt. Formidable at Kool Aid Lake Day 4Day 4 we woke up and ate, and waited for the 3 guys to get back from bringing our sick guy home.  They arrived around 1:30 pm, pretty tired from having just done Kool Aid, to the parking lot, and back to Kool Aid in 24 hours, even with minimal gear.  We discussed the option taking another rest day, but no one wanted to hold up the group again, as we still had the goal of Dome Peak as a possibility if we didn't lose another day.  We took off from Kool Aid by 2:45 pm.  The red ledges were pretty fun, great views en route to Middle Cascade Glacier.  Middle cascade glacier proved to be pretty big, and we had to go lower than we thought we would to get onto it, so it turned into a much bigger ascent than we had planned.  As we neared the top of Middle Cascade Glacier, one of the guys who had walked our sick member back, started to show a significant amount of fatigue and other symptoms that lined up with the indicators of Rhabdomyolysis.  We determined that we needed him evacuated ASAP so we moved at as good a pace as we could up over middle cascade glacier the rest of the way, dropped down the col on the south side, and got to a spot for Airlift Northwest to land.  They responded quickly to our request, and within about 40 minutes of our call the helicopter arrived to get our guy.  This was around 9:55 pm, the pilots did an okay job locating us in the dark, as well as with getting down to our spot.  Turns out they weren't going to take any of his gear, so we had to split up his 80lbs among the remaining 8 of us and move in the dark the rest of the way to Yang Yang lakes.  We got to Yang Yang around 2:00 am, and we made the call to take the next day as a rest day, to ensure that the other 2 guys that had done the extra kool-aid to parking lot walks didn't meet the same fate as our recently evacuated member. Mt. Formidable in the Morning. Middle Cascade glacier from just past the Red Ledges.   Le Conte as we crested Middle Cascade Glacier to find a place to do a helicopter evacuation. Airlift Northwest coming in in front of Le Conte Glacier They landed on a decent snow ledge around 7020ft elevation on the back of Mt. Formidable. Day 5 This was just a much needed rest day after the previous events.  Yang Yang lakes is certainly not lacking for scenery as a place to spend the day.  A little buggy though. Le Conte Mountain and Glacier from Yang Yang Lakes Day 6Today we took off for White Rock lakes.  Thankfully we were getting better at snow movement so we only took about 10 hours to complete the walk from Yang Yang to White Rock Lakes.  At this point a couple guys had packs over 90lbs, thanks to having to split up our evacuee's gear, so we were moving slower and had to take many breaks, especially since it was over 90 degrees F this day, without a single cloud.  The crevasse field on Le Conte wasn't bad, just two snow bridges and one walk-around to get up this glacier.  South Cascade glacier was as smooth as could be, didn't even rope up for that one.  Coming over the South Cascade glacier col to see white rock lakes was really impressive.  The best view of the trip!  I'd say that the Ptarmigan Traverse is worth it just for this view.  White rocks was my favorite bivouac site, great water, and perfect for an icy swim.  Some guys swam at every lake on the route, and this was by far the coldest.  This leg also had the most-vertical rock scramble along the route.  We saw another trail that led us to believe we had chosen the hard route, but just be ready for a good class IV scramble if you follow our GPX, getting up to the ridge line from Yang Yang.  With 80-90lb packs, it was a little difficult but not needing to be roped up.  The glissade from South Cascade glacier to White Rock lakes was a nice reprieve from the usual knee-breaking descents. Spider Formidable Col to Yang Yang lakes from the bottom of Le Conte Glacier. Le Conte lake and glacier Reddish rocks above the South Cascade Glacier The view from South Cascade col, Dome, Spire, and White Rock Lake Dome and Gunsight peaks from White Rock Lakes Day 7Today we set out and headed along the route taking you below white rock lakes, to the base of Dana Glacier and over near Spire point.  The movement from White Rock Lakes to Dana Glacier went down lower than we thought it would, somewhat disappointing as we were hoping for a bit less ascending for this day.  The entry onto Dana Glacier was much easier than we thought it would be when we looked across the valley from White Rock Lake.  It isn't as steep as it looks from afar.  The slog up the glacier was long and uneventful, since we were easily able to map a route avoiding the crevasses before leaving White Rock lake.  It took a few tries to find a good crossover point at the col, but once across there was plenty of glissading to get down towards Cub Lake.  However Cub Lake is not as close as it looks, it seemed to take forever to get from the Dana Glacier crossover to Cub Lake.  Once there, Cub Lake was the warmest lake and was actually pleasant to swim in, but also buggy.  We ate our second to last meals and checked our route out of the woods for the next day.  I was fairly tired at this point in the trip, so not many en-route pictures. Dome Peak in the morning from the route leading our of White Rock Lake Waterfalls off the back of Spire Point from Cub Lake Day 8Got up and started our walk our to Suiattle River Road.  Nothing much to say about this section aside from the fact it was looong, not that many great views once you get into bachelor creek and beyond.  Total distance was maybe 12-13 miles.  The trail isn't that easy to follow this early in the season in Bachelor, but we were on track about 75% of the time.  The times we were off the trail were, of course, quite rough with our giant packs.  The 6 miles along Downey Creek were just a regular old walk, which got us back to the end cars around 8:00 pm, where we loaded up and headed back. Aside from the spectacular mountains of Washington, the biggest thing we took away from this trip is don't overpack, but never skimp on food.  Almost everyone only packed 2 x 2.5-serving Mountain House / Backpackers Pantry meals a day, totaling at most 1925 calories.  We made up daytime eating with sport gels, granola bars, jerky etc; but everyone would have been far, far better off with a dedicated mid-day stop for a whole 2.5 serving meal.  We may have spared ourselves both the sick guy and the evacuation if we would have had more nutrition right off the bat on this trip.  It was 80-90 degrees every day during this trip, so we were burning up everything we had like crazy and sweating it out as fast as we could get it in.   Images View Ptarmigan Traverse, June 2015 Image Gallery - 24 Images Comments Post a Comment Viewing: 1-14 of 14 EastKing - Jul 8, 2015 12:37 pm - Voted 10/10 Great report!!!

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/liberty-cap-beating-2-ptarmigan-ridge/783682,Liberty Cap Beating #2: Ptarmigan Ridge,2011-07-24,"July 22-25, 2011 Mt Rainier - Ptarmigan Ridge (IV, 55 degree snow/ice, AI2/WI2, 5.6/M3) Though not as popular and well known as neighboring Liberty Ridge, many climbers who have done both consider Ptarmigan Ridge a better climb, and possibly the best route on Mt. Rainier. The path of Ptarmigan Ridge is less direct and the position less striking, and sadly the real climbing ends at a much lower altitude than Liberty Ridge (ca. 12,200’ rather than at Liberty Cap’s lofty 14,112’.) However, Ptarmigan Ridge offers more technical climbing, with steeper slopes, more ice, and a choice of two finishes: A less popular variation that climbs through an icefall to the left, and the standard right variation that ascends a chimney system through a rock band and requires some technical rock climbing on perhaps the only good rock on the mountain. Friday – “Mostly Sunny” Approach to Observation Camp Vital gear for an alpine climb Although it seems that most climbers these days climb the ridge after a long traverse across the Winthrop and Carbon Glaciers from the White River Trailhead, we opted for the original & more scenic approach from Mowich Lake. I wasn’t a fan of the 2 hour drive required to set up the car shuttle (or the 2 hour drive back after the climb), but this approach was so much more scenic than the White River one and totally worth the effort. Rainforest hiking to the big mountain. The forecast for the weekend and all of next week was “Mostly Sunny” with a high pressure system that settled in. The clouds at the Mowich trailhead apparently didn’t get the message, as we had to navigate in whiteout by GPS through Spray Park. Normally a nice meadow of wildflowers this time of year, we were still climbing on snow. I was getting worried that we wouldn’t be able to observe the mountain from our camp at Observation Rock, but fortunately as we got higher and the day dragged on the clouds lowered and we were treated with a spectacular view of the north side of Mt. Rainier. Clouds parting as we near the Flett Glacier and Observation Rock Camp Echo Rock Worms in the Flett Glacier We crossed the Flett Glacier at set up camp at a nice spot with running water and two large boulders that made for some interesting bouldering problems – especially in our mountaineering boots.

Views as I Wandered Above Camp I was hoping to get some nice shots of the Mowich Face since I’m interested in doing some future ice climbs there, and after ascending another 1,000 ft I found a nice overlook to the Mowich Face and North Mowich Glacier North Mowich Glacier I woke up from my nap and tagged Observation Pk on my way back to camp. I recommend this side trip as it is pretty easy and you get great views of the entire north side of Mt. Rainier. N Side of Mt Rainier Seen From Observation Rock. Mowich Face is on the Right. Sunset at Observation Camp After dinner, I got out my camera and tripod and spent the night taking long exposure shots between sleeping breaks. The weather was mild, so I just moved my sleeping bag around with my camera as I took different shots, sleeping during the hour it took to get some of the shots. Saturday – ‘Dogturdite’ Ridge and Approaching High CampThis day was a short, chill day up to High Camp. The Russell Glacier was chill enough that like on the Flett Glacier there was no need to rope up. Moat on the North Mowich Glacier Most of the approach is pretty easy by staying on the Russell Glacier to the east of the ridge crest for most of the approach. Next step was crossing what Anastasia called “Dogturdite Ridge”, which is the final knife-edge ridge leading to the Ptarmigan Ridge high camp (""dogturdite"" is a definition by Kyle Flick, a local WA climber, who gave Anastasia beta on its bypass last year). If it were composed of dog turd it may not have been so bad, but since it was actually composed of Cascade volcanic graham cracker, this made for some interesting class 2 scrambling with a heavy pack on. Though Anastasia was native to Portland and led WI4, somehow she has thus far avoided much of the loose rock in the Cascades, as she was scared stiff on this section. I just kicked down rocks and dug into the gravel until I got some small toe prints that would hold, and delicately moved across the terrain, telling her which rocks you can lean on, and reminding her to try to stay balanced on her feet and not lean in to pull on rocks. Beginning the Downclimb to Bypass the Rock Step on 'Dogturd' Ridge We were stopped by an overhanging rock step, but bypassed it by down climbing 40 degree snow slopes to the east for about 200 ft and traversing the rest of the ridge on the lower snow slopes. Anastasia on the Bypass of the Rock Step on 'Dogturd' Ridge Since we had another early day at camp, but I couldn’t easily venture higher on the mountain this day, I used my energy to make some productive additions to the high camp. Alien Visitors to the High Camp Our New Climbing Partner Was Rock Solid We had another clear night so I spent another night doing night photography. (In case you were wondering, yes, ice avalanches come off of the Ptarmigan Ice Cliff pretty frequently, but the camp is just high enough from the connecting saddle and the ridge shear enough that the camp is protected from the debris). Happy Night Photos Sunday – Ptarmigan Ridge! Crossing Fresh Avalanche Debris On Our Alpine Start Alpenglow on the Route Above. Can You See the Climbers Ahead? There was one other party on the route that day, and they were about 1 hour and 1,000 ft ahead of us. As the sun cast brilliant alpenglow on the rocks above little bits of ice trickled down the slope as we simul-soloed up slopes of continuous slopes of 40 degree neve with occasional short bits of ice. At first I thought the ice trickles were knocked down by the other climbers, but eventually the trickles grew larger and some rocks started coming down with them – the sun was reaching the plastered rime on the cliffs above! Anastasia seemed used to this and climbed on. Coming from the more solid ranges of the Sierra and the Wasatch, I’m not used to projectiles flying at me, so now it was my turn to be the shaky-legged one. Eventually I got used to it and learned to keep my eyes & ears open to the sound of falling debris, and then tuck in my tools and keep my head down when the little barrage arrived. Rounding the Corner, About to Start the Steep Traverse Although the climbing was still easy, we did start placing screws at this point as we were more worried about a fall caused by getting hit than by lack of technique. I got my opportunity to lead just before the steep traverse. We were encountering more ice now, and the traverse was quite a thrilling surprise – 300 ft of continuous traversing on 55 degree ice, with a lot of exposure below. I front-pointed and swung tools the entire way, but fortunately the ice was easy enough if you tested placements, so I only placed one stubby every 100 ft – just enough to keep one piece between us as we simul-climbed. First Pitch of Sustained Ice After the Steep Traverse Now it was getting fun as the slopes got icier and stayed in the 45-55 degree range. After the traverse Anastasia took off in the lead. She led the remaining pitches as we agreed that I’d get the rock pitch if she could have the ice pitches. Another Traversing Ice Pitch The route ascended a series of short icy headwalls connected by sections of steep traversing as we threaded the cliff bands. The climbing was great! Ice everywhere, but none of it was too hard so we made decent time. One Stubby Anchor Backed Up with Tools. Luckily the Ice Climbing was Easy and Secure! The only way things could have been better was if we had brought more screws. We only had 4, and with continuous ice and a 30m rope, we had to stop every 300 ft to recover screws, and all anchors were built out of a single stubby equalized with two tools. We would have been faster and more secure with 8 screws in these conditions. Final Traverse to the Chimney Final Ice Pitch Before the Chimney At last we reached the rock chimney, and I eagerly charged up into the rocks. Ready to Lead the Chimney! Some Class 4 & Loose Blocks I clambered through some class 4 rock mixed with snow and ice, climbed up a short section of ice, and reached the crux rock step. Happy Chimney Climbing Climbing the First Half of the 5.6 Crux Step. The step is about 15 ft of 5.6 climbing, but doing this section in crampons with a heavy pack made it a lot more interesting! I placed a cam to backup the hidden piton at the crux (we brought them so I might as well use them), and after a bit of stemming & mantling I was above the rock band. We encountered one more pitch of ice above the rock and then the climb was over. It was only about noon and now we had a little under 2,000 ft of slogging up snow slopes to reach Liberty Cap, with only 1 bergschrund crossing to keep us entertained. Liberty Cap Strikes AgainMy first hint that we were in trouble was when we stopped to eat a snack after the last technical pitch. I had been concerned about moving fast earlier in the day, and as we put our packs down Anastasia said ""See Mark, we weren't that slow. The team ahead of us is right there."" The climbers ahead of us had pulled away during the first half of the route, and I doubted that we had caught up to them. ""Where?"" I asked. ""Right by the seracs over there,"" she replied. I saw the seracs about 100 ft away, but there was no one there. Only footprints. ""Anastasia, there is no one there."" ""Yes there is. I can see them moving!"" Uh oh. Anastasia was hallucinating. I asked her how she was feeling and she admitted to feeling a bit tired and sick. I suspected that she had AMS and that we needed to get down ASAP. However, the route is not one that is descended, so our only option was to climb another 2,000 ft higher to Liberty Cap and make the mile traverse above 13,500 ft to the Columbia Crest before we could even being descending again. To make matters worse, our sunny day had deteriorated into a mostly cloudy day, and the cloud level was at about 12,500 ft. It looked like I was in for another white-out traverse of the Cap. Anastasia Nearing the Bergschrund Crossing After We Finished the Technical Climbing. The whiteout awaits ahead . . . Anastasia led out as I told her my suspicions and that we needed to get up and over the mountain fast. She got noticeably slower at this point, and by the time we reached 13,000 ft she plopped down and asked me to lead on. The higher we got the worse she got. At about 13,500 ft Anastasia started demanding that we stop and make camp and descend the next day on account of the whiteout and her feeling sick and exhausted. Although I was willing to stop with Eric on Liberty Cap, in that circumstance I knew that we could recover and be stronger for a continued descent. In Anastasia's case, I knew that if her problem was AMS, if we stopped up high we would be in even worse condition to descend the next day. Anastasia was too tired to care much about my concern, but I got her to keep going by giving her the rest of my food and water. By the time we got to Liberty Cap we were engaged in an tough case of tug of war, and every few minutes she stopped and tried to talk me into making camp. ""We are not making camp until we at least reach 12,000 ft on the Emmons Glacier,"" I said. That would at least put us just below the elevation where Anastasia started having problems, and it would have us on one of the major trade routes where it would be easy to get assistance for descent if her AMS got worse. I also secretly hoped that if I got her that far we could finish the final relatively straightforward 2,000 ft descent to Camp Schurman. For a while Anastasia agreed to go along with my demand, but as she got more tired and sick, our pace slowed, and it became increasingly difficult to keep her moving. I felt bad about being so cruel in that respect, but I felt that we would be in serious trouble if we made camp, and that if she had enough energy to complain and argue, she had enough energy to keep moving. ""Anastasia, we can rest all you need to keep moving, but we cannot stop and make camp."" This worked for a while, and we spent about half the time resting as she tried to eat and drink. Eventually she stopped caring about getting down and became resistant to continuing on again. I (half bluffingly) said I would only be willing to make camp sooner than the Emmons Glacier if I called for rescue with my SPOT device and cell phone. This worked for a while longer as she was not willing to call for rescue yet and the terrain had flattened. Unfortunately it only got us to the saddle between Liberty Cap & Columbia Crest, when we had to gain another 200' to bypass the seracs that I knew were waiting for us above the Winthrop Glacier. Anastasia was getting disoriented enough at this point that she was getting lost, despite being tied into me! The clouds were so thick she couldn't see me at the end of the rope and couldn't make sense of the rope tension. She also fell into a small crevasse as she was no longer really looking out for herself. I brought in coils, increasing the danger of one of us pulling the other into a crevasse in hopes that she could better follow me and I could better point out crevasses I found probing. I knew that if I fell into one I would be on my own, so I moved very carefully. Visibility was as bad as when I had crossed the Cap with Eric the weekend prior, and although I had our GPS track, it was still very difficult to stay on course with all of these other curve balls thrown into the scene. After an interminable amount of time and bickering as she continued to resist pushing on, we finally reached the Emmons Glacier. For a while she improved as we descended. As I had hoped, we came across a climbing party, and although we seemed to be moving OK by this time, I asked them to tell the rangers at Camp Schurman about our situation, and that we might need assistance in the morning to finish descending. We barely made it to 12,000 ft by sunset. By this point Anastasia was deteriorating again as she began throwing up the food she was trying to eat, and was falling down uncontrollably. After hopping across one crevasse on a slope, she fell down and almost slid into the next crevasse downhill before self-arresting. I REALLY needed a second climber to help short-rope her! I didn't want to stop with her due to her condition, but between her begging to stop again, the fall and approaching darkness, I relented and chopped out a ledge with my ice tool and set up the tent. Fortunately, despite Anastasia being so uncooperative and me being so unsympathetic to her pleas, we made amends and Anastasia admitted that as much as I was being a jerk, she was being stubborn and it was good that we had pressed on to get to where we were. I had my first bit of food & drink since topping out on Ptarmigan Ridge 9 hours earlier (it normally takes 3 hrs to cover the same terrain) and went to sleep. Monday – The Joys of Bottled Oxygen and Rescuers""Mark! I'm feeling a lot worse. We have to go down now!"" I woke to Anastasia's call for help at 1am. As I had feared, 12,000 ft was not low enough for her to improve, and although the initial rest had helped, now she was feeling a lot worse. At this point I knew that we were in an easy location for calling for assistance, that daylight wasn't too long away, and it would probably be safer at this point to hold tight until daylight and send for help instead of descending. Anastasia on Oxygen During Our Assisted Descent Fortunately within an hour climbing ranger Nick Hall and 3 volunteers had arrived. My message to the descending climbers had reached Nick and he had decided to head up and check on us. They also brought bottled oxygen and after checking Anastastia's A&O level she was put on the oxygen. This helped her feel better and she was finally able to eat food again without puking it back up. We helped one of the rescuers into our tent while the others bivied outside and waited for daylight. Anastasia & the Rescue Team 2 hours later Anastasia was short-roped down the Emmons on oxygen while one of the volunteers and I carried her gear and the camp down. We made it to the ranger shelter without incident and spent the rest of the day eating and hydrating. Anastasia's dizziness and nausea dissipated and by the afternoon we were released and descended to the White River trail head. ReflectionsI had been worried about whether I had taken the best action given our circumstances, as obviously I was pushing Anastasia very hard to keep moving, and we were at high risk for having an accident by doing so. Naturally I found the whole experience very upsetting and I had a lot of self-doubt about how I was responding, so it was relieving to hear from the rescuers that my decision to push us forward up and over the Cap and to make it to where we did was probably the best one in a situation where there was no ideal solution. It was really good that we didn't stop higher as well because the sunny forecast for that week had changed again to a stormy one and it rained and snowed for the next several days on the mountain. Anastasia had ascended Mt Rainier at least 4 times prior under a similar ascent rate and had been above 14,000 ft on a few peaks in California, all without incident. Between her history at altitude and a moderately acclimatized ascent (one night at 8,000 ft & one at 10,300 ft), Anastasia's sudden development of AMS at 12,000 ft was a huge surprise to everyone including her. Fortunately, we were as reasonably prepared as one could be for such an epic, we had made good decisions with what was available to us. Although she will be more wary of ascending to high altitude as fast again and may start using some Diamox preemptively, Anastasia wasn't at all deterred from her alpine passions. Two weeks later she climbed the Price Glacier on Mt Shuksan (IV, AI3 cl.4-5). Notes Gear Notes We brought 4 stubby ice screws, 2 screamers, and 2 pickets. In icy conditions like we had, 8 screws would be better for longer simul-climbing pitches and better anchors. Bring 1-3 cams of 0.5”-1” for the rock pitch (optional - fixed piton may suffice for many). Approach Notes White River Approach is preferred by many since you can do a round trip from the same trailhead. However, you have a LONG traverse crossing the Winthrop and Carbon Glaciers, requiring roped glacier travel and navigating crevasses. This approach becomes harder in later season and might be impassable as the glaciers open up. The Mowich Approach requires leaving a car at White River TH and then driving 2 hrs to the Mowich TH. However, this approach is more scenic, the lower camp has running water, and you don’t need to get out the rope until you start climbing above high camp. Both approaches merge just before the final loose knife edge section of ridge before the high camp. This section is better earlier in the season when it still has snow cover. In later season you can drop down to the east on snow to bypass loose rock & a rock step, but by late season this might be melted out. Take care as the rock is steep & loose and a fall with a large pack could be fatal. LinksReport on Personal Website Full photo album on Picasa.

LuminousAphid - May 14, 2013 11:52 am - Hasn't voted Read your front-page report ...and now this one after mrchad pointed out that you had another incident in the comments there. You might think about your pace on the mountain and how it relates to your partner's pace, stamina, etc. One thing I see in common after reading both reports (besides both being nearly or truly disastrous) is that you seem very strong willed, and maybe you are pushing your partner faster and harder than they should be pushed. I have been in the partner end of this situation, and gotten sick at low altitude by going too fast and being too proud to speak up and request rests early on; you may be feeling great, but my guess is that she was feeling pretty bad long before you even noticed. There's my 2 cents, your decision making after the fact was still great though and like others have said, you were well-prepared when things did go wrong, which is sometimes all you can do. I would start to think about prevention though if I were you, since this has happened at least twice to your partner on two different mountains at comparatively modest altitudes. PellucidWombat - Jun 3, 2013 2:07 am - Hasn't voted Re: Read your front-page report The problem here, and maybe it doesn't really come through, is that I did NOT start pushing Nastia until after (IMO) it was safer to get over to the Emmons Glacier than to stop, or retreat into dangerous and more isolated terrain. We spent 2 nights acclimatizing and her issues came on at 12,000 ft - VERY unusual. Liberty Ridge, we were prepared for 5 days while planning for 3, and we came down just fine in 4 days with both of us completely fine. Tom was FAR stronger than me. Any sense you have of me 'pushing partners' here must either be from a casual reading, or perhaps I didn't emphasize certain details enough, or perhaps it is how Chad framed things for you. He has a personal vendetta against me and has had NO interest in any reasonable discussion with me (he sends me harassing e-mails from time to time without provocation). Nick (the Rainier ranger who assisted us) agreed with me on this decision, which I was REALLY torn about. I asked them point blank if we should have attempted to reverse the route or stop earlier, as we had the means to do so, and I really wondered if I had some major oversight there. If anyone would have good reason to conservatively tell me I screwed up, it would have been Nick, but he insisted this was one of those 's#it happens' situations and we did things about as well as they could have been done. He climbed with Nastia after this trip, and so did Vitaliy M(usiyenko) and many others, even with this event, which really was more Nastia's problem than mine (apart from me making her well-being my problem when it came to light that she was having more of a problem than she was admitting to). I am wary of climbing with Nastia, but still do, and I seem to be far more concerned about her at altitude than she is. On the ascent I repeatedly asked her about how she was feeling, especially about altitude as she was moving slow, but on most of my mountain outings, my partners are almost always moving slower. I have been with enough slower partners that it is really hard to tell if they are less fit, having a bad day, or suffering from AMS, especially if they deny altitude sickness and do not show outward signs of AMS beyond the fatigue that is normal from thinner air and high physical exertion. Considering Nastia had been to the summit of Rainier multiple times before, and above 14,000 ft elsewhere, I had a reasonable reason to believe her history at altitude and her self-awareness about it. I regularly run up to 13k-14k for climbs here in CA in less than 24 hrs with partners (several times a month from may through October). Honestly, her breakdown at 12,000 ft after spending 2 nights acclimatizing has me EXTREMELY disconcerted about these things, but the high altitude experts I talked with after Tom's passing insisted that that sort of response is extremely rare, and highly unusual with someone that has not had a prior history or is not showing other more obvious signs first. Maybe lightning strikes in the same place twice . . . but I don't pass this off lightly, and I'm still trying to hold to what the experts' opinions are and not give in to emotional panic, as chilled as I feel about it. I still spend nights at altitude with partners, but I don't sleep too soundly as I know that I am more concerned about the 'what-ifs' about them and altitude than they are. anita - Jun 3, 2013 10:52 am - Hasn't voted Re: Read your front-page report it's called private messages. everyone on SP has had to read all this stuff countless times it seems. if you really feel the need to justify your actions to some random person posting random comments, take it to PM. do it for the rest of us, please.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/colchuck-equinox-epic-that-included-night-glissading/606488,Colchuck Equinox Epic that included Night Glissading,2010-03-30,"Introduction  Dragontail and Colchuck Well after an amazing winter for climbing, it is now springtime in the Cascades. Traditionally this is the start of snow-climbing season here although this snow-climbing season started much earlier due to a much warmer than usual winter. The weather window was set and the weather on the Eastern side the Cascades were going to be better than the western side of the Cascades. I was flirting with the idea of redoing Eldorado but after looking at the weather I decided to join on in a trip with Dave (mtn.climber) and his son. I invited Mike Lewis and Colin (RokisGud on cascadeclimbers.com and nwhikers.net) for this trip. Dave and his son were going to leave early heading up to Colchuck and we were going to meet him up there about 2 pm at Colchuck Lake. From there we were going to all head for the summit and then head back to camp down at the lake and camp the night before heading out the next day. The Trip Up Colchuck LakeColin, Mike Lewis and I reached the road leading to the trailhead around 9 am. The road itself is gated off this time of year meaning that we had to go up the road 4 miles to the Stuart Lake trailhead. Though it was long getting to the trailhead the road up was quiet scenic but it also had a couple of icy patches on it making for some slipping and sliding. I made the mistake of bringing plastics on this trip and early on I was regretting this decision. Once we hit steady snow it was quick moving up the road to the trailhead. Just before we got to the trailhead we got a quick view of our destination, Colchuck. Then came the Stuart Lake Trail. At roughly 10:30 am this trail was incredibly icy. Had I had my normal shoes it would have been easy because all I would have needed were micro-spikes and I would have been all set. Unfortunately though I had plastics on and the icy trail was a real pain for me in the beginning. My friends were very patient with me here but I know these shoes were REALLY slowing me down here. The ice here wasn't helping at all and it was making this trip up hard. At the turnoff to the Colchuck Lake Trail I decided to have Mike go ahead of us so that he could setup camp at Colchuck Lake. Colin and I headed up behind him after a short break. After hitting the 5000 foot mark I decided to have Colin go ahead of me because I was very tired from the plastic and it was quiet a chore hiking up to Colchuck Lake. During the last bit up to Colchuck Lake I decided I was go to set camp and pray for the weather to be good tomorrow. I was tired and worn out and most of it was from the shoes. By the time I reached camp across the Lake I was extremely tired and fatigue. I found out when I reached camp Mike Lewis was suffering but Colin was in great shape to go for the summit. Dave and his son had headed to the summit earlier than 2 pm due to weather potentially moving in. So we urged Colin to go for it at lunch and we were going to sit back and wait for morning. Colin gave us both a Zip-Fizz and than headed for the summit. Guess what!! We are heading to the summit  Heading up to the Gap After thirty minutes of talking and taking a long rest Mike Lewis and I had second thought about staying back. Both of knew it was now because the weather was going to crappy later that night. Maybe it was Colin's ZipFizz or maybe it was the rest we had but we changed our minds and went for it. It was time to for Colchuck. Heading up the steep slopes to the moraine was tough but not nearly as hard as other parts of the journey up. Jimbopo and I took or time going up and both of us brought two headlamps for descent so we were not going to rush here. On the Colchuck Glacier  Slowly but surely we picked our way up the mountain to the glacier (not crevasses at all in winter so no reason to rope up) where we put on our crampons and headed up the glacier to the col. It actually was getting easier for us the higher we went up. What looked like an impossibility was slowly becoming a reality on the way up. The angle of the glacier was never over 40 degrees and we taking good steps to the col. We ran into Dave and his son right around the col and Colin who summited just after the col. All were very happy to see us heading up.  The final section to the summit After talking very shortly we decided to head up the short crux to the summit ridge. Luckily it was mostly a snow climb here instead of a Class 3 scramble like it traditionally is in summer. Though we were tired we had decent foothold and just as the sun was setting we were summiting Colchuck. I was never more happy to be looking at Mt. Stuart from our vantage point. Yeah we did it EastKing gets the summit Mike Lewis gets the summit as well. It was tiring, exhausting and EPIC but without a doubt it was WELL WORTH THE EFFORT! Rainier, Glacier Peak capped of the views of literally thousands of snowcapped summits. We watched the sun setting behind what looked like some storm clouds and took ten minutes to enjoy the incredible views from the summit. 6800 feet elevation gain on snow is not easy but we were now here to enjoy the amazing views from the summit. Stuart was to the west and Dragontail was to the east. Hopefully soon I will have my chance with them both. Time was running out on sunlight so we only spent a little time up there but this summit will be something that I will never forget. And the views from Colchuck at this time of year are amazing. I was so happy to get to the summit but down it was time to head down and we were only halfway done. Dragontail from Colchuck Stuart with the sunset Night Glissading Summit block at sunset Once past the small summit block (which reminded us that there was a 2000 foot drop-off to the north!!) we headed down first the over the gentle semi-plateau section of Colchuck to the crux. The snow was beginning to freeze but the plastics which I was dreading for so long was able to kick right through it Jimbopo and I stayed very close together until we reached the col. Once we hit the col the sun was completely down and both Jimbopo and I were concerned about doing a fast glissade down to the camp. So at first we took our time until we saw some clear glissade tracks. At this point it was time to take off the crampons and let it rip. I here this is the best glissade in Washington and I wanted to give it a shot. That being said we both did two self-arrest practices to test the snow. It was in great shape and it looked ready to ride. So about 500 feet from the col we started a number of very well controlled glissades down the glacier. We kept it slow in order to make sure we did not cliff out or get out of control. Both of us also capitalized on the glissade zone to take a couple practice self arrest. Control was very important but it was quiet amazing to watch Lake Colchuck get closer and closer as we continued to glissade down this glacier. Also we could headlamps from the camps below us and the moon which had just risen above Colchuck. We continue the trip down to the lake and though it took a little longer for us that those in the daytime it will be an experience that I will never forget. Less than forty minutes after entering the col we were at the bottom and back at camp. The experience though will stay with me for a long time. Bad weather moves in  Storm the morning after Well after we went to sleep the weather took a change for the worst. That it was very windy with a wind speed at least forty miles per hour. Our tent was luckily reinforced with trekking poles and ice axes so it withstood the worse. Plus with us three in there the tent wasn't going anywhere. That being said, it was a rough night to get much sleep. Often you could hear the wind just howling at the tent and occasionally you could hear snow hitting the tent as well. It was amazing to hear how quickly the weather could change in such a short while. Somehow we managed some sleep but the instinct were right had we not gone for the summit of Colchuck when we did our chance would have been lost! Time to backpack out The weather on the way down though gradually improved. In fact the wind died down dramatically and the weather actually cleared up for awhile. At times we were in the sun which actually softening up some of the icy areas on the way up. Heading down the Colchuck Lake trail was actually not bad at all but the Stuart Lake trail with its ups and down was become a real problem for us. It was very neat though going over the snow-covered bridge. It was king of like traversing a knife-edge with a step in either direct with the same result. That being said outside of the ups and down this section was uneventful as was the 4 mile trip down the road to the car. We did get hit with a rain shower on the way back but overall the trip back to the car, though painful for me was uneventful. ConclusionI want to thank Dave for the invitation on the trip . I wished that I got to spend more time with but am glad that we at least meet and talked for a bit. I also want to thank Colin and Jimbopo for coming on the trip and making a number of very smart decisions while on this trip. You were great coming and I look forward to MANY more hikes/climbs with you. I have also learned that I am going to get a better mountaineering boot and save my plastics for Rainier, Denali, etc. I am feeling the pain of those two nasty blisters and will keep that in mind the next time I am making my decisions in the mountains. Another awesome trip on what is becoming an amazing year.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/mount-formidable-direct-ne-face-5-6-iii-second-ascent/857617,Mount Formidable Direct NE Face 5.6 III - Second Ascent,2013-07-18,"Introduction and Approach As I was on my way back to Washington from Montana I was searching for someone to climb a good peak with and Dane was up for the challenge to attempt the direct northeast face of Mount Formidable. I always knew Formidable was one of the iconic Cascade peaks however the thought of climbing it was a last minute decision among some of my other choices I had in mind. After some Facebook conversations, we agreed to give it a go despite the weather forecast calling for thunderstorms on Wednesday. So on Monday July 15th I made the long drive to Seattle from Red Lodge, Montana to pick up Dane and we I finished the drive up to Marblemount. We crashed alongside the Cascade River Road at 3:30 in the morning and agreed to sleep in as long as possible. Around 9:30 Tuesday morning the sun woke us up and we drove up to the Cascade Pass Trailhead and organized our gear. It wasn't long before we were headed up the stupidly inclined trail to Cascade Pass. 36 switchbacks later, just before reaching the pass I see a marmot and a coyote battling it out. Just as the coyote was about to start biting the marmot to death it hides into a hole and the coyote tries pulling him out but upon seeing us he scatters. For the next 5 minutes the marmot cries an annoying yelping sound. Interesting sight to see! After a short break at the pass and a brief talk with the ranger, I put my big boots on and we start hiking south up towards the Cache glacier. The first part of the path was snow free and I was wishing I still had my sandals on. We hit snow soon enough though and I am easily able to kick steps to Cache viewpoint. We descended a short ways and roped up for the Cache glacier crossing. Although there are only a few small crevasses on the lower section of this glacier we still decided to rope up for the way in. After an hour or so of hot, sweaty and blinding snow hiking we arrive at the large cornice blocking the way to Cache Col. A five foot vertical climb and some thrashing with my axe gets me up and onto bare ground at the col. Here we unrope and plunge step our way down mellow snow to Kool Aid Lake. Here we set up camp on a nice flat section and relaxed, taking in the views of Mount Formidable across the valley. We head to bed early since the plan was to get started at 4am for the climb. Well, that didn't exactly happen... Hiking above Cascade Pass...Sahale behind Looking up the Cache glacier Forbidden Peak across the way First look at Mount Formidable Mount Formidable from Cache Col Arts Knoll from Kool Aid Lake Thunderstorm Induced Delay So around 11pm that night it started to rain...hard! I thought to myself ""I hope this passes"" but alas, 4 in the morning came around and I was awaken once again instead this time it was a huge clap of thunder. Looms like the forecast was correct. It stormed with a fairly constant flash and boom for the next few hours and we briefly talked it over in the tent and agreed to simply sleep in and see what the weather does later in the morning. At around 9, it cleared out and we emerged to see some residual clouds over Formidable but a clear western sky. We decided to make the climb up Formidable the following day and try to hike back out right after. ""That would be a very long day"" Dane said but I replied I was up for the challenge. We relaxed and waited for the skies to clear a little more and decided to do a short climb up the east ridge of Arts Knoll. So from Kool Aid Lake we hike up the snowfields to the saddle between Hurry Up Peak and Arts Knoll. The snow was exposed to the direct sunlight and we were sweating bullets on this short 800 foot ascent to the saddle. Once we got to the saddle though the breeze picked up and cooled us off just the right amount. We scrambled up some very loose class 3 and 4 terrain for a hundred feet or so until I was able to locate the correct start to the route. Dane belayed as I climbed around a small tower and up to some old slings at the base of a right facing chimney with a smooth slab to the right side. I clipped into the slings (which I also backed up with my own), and Dane climbed up. We stashed boots and extra gear here and I led up the chimney which had a somewhat tricky 5.7 start where I had to smear my right foot on the slab and pull through a small overhang to get into the easier section of the chimney above. There were some loose death blocks but the rock was solid where it needed to be. Once above the 5.7 start it was a fun and easy stem up the chimney for 100 feet up where the terrain eased and I found a few solid cracks to set an anchor and belay Dane up. I thought there would be one more pitch for Dane to lead but once I rounded the corner I realized the summit was 5 feet above me. Doh...""Sorry Dane"" I remember saying. Regardless, it was a fun climb to make the day a success. Most people who summit Arts Knoll walk up the easy west ridge on their way through on the Ptarmigan Traverse. Dane scrambling the loose class 4 crap Looking up our east ridge route Me leading the 5.7 start to our route Now our descent was a little interesting to say the least. We were unable to find any good rappel anchors to rappel the route (since we had gear at the base to retrieve). While I was searching for an anchor I noticed the low angle slab route that Loren and Jens used on their first ascent trip in 2002 (which we were using their beta for our climb on Formidable). I had the idea to lower Dane down this slab (which was a much easier route) off the same anchor I used to belay him up. On his way down he would put some pro in the large cracks and I would downclimb and pick them up on my way down. Although this took much longer, it worked perfectly. From the base of the slab, there were two slings lying next to a large boulder which we used to rappel the rest of the way down to the snow below the sketchy part we scrambled. On the way down I swung over and got our stashed gear. Once we were on the snow, it was a short traverse back to the saddle. From here we ran down the snow back to Kool Aid Lake and was back at camp around 5pm. We ate a nice dinner and went to sleep early.  ""OK Lets try this again"" I remark...4am start time?"" Dane replies yes and we are off to sleep. I occasionally open the tent to photograph the sunset. Formidable still had some clouds around it but I knew the next morning it would be clear and the valleys would likely have fog below us. Descending after climbing Arts Knoll Clouds over Formidable Light beams from Kool Aid Lake Sunset view from the tent Mount Formidable Direct Northeast Face At 4am we got up right on time and it only took us 15 minutes to get our stuff together and start towards the red ledge. With my plastic boots on, hiking across talus was a little painful but I managed. Crossing the red ledge wasn't too hard, just kick some steps and walk across the 5 foot wide ledge. Once across we continued traversing until we found a logical place to leave the Ptarmigan Traverse path and descend about 600 feet to a flat section in the Middle Cascade glacier at 5,500 feet elevation between two huge icefall sections. We roped up once we hit the end of the talus slopes and walked out onto a wild place. Chunks of ice, piles of rocks and lots of corn snow was all mixed together in a mess of summertime glacier. I said to dane we should cross this section of the glacier and ascend a few hundred feet up the Formidable Glacier as quickly as possible to avoid getting hit by falling debris. It was clear by looking at the huge piles of junk on the snow that stuff falls here all the time! So off we went, quickly ascending in a serious fall zone. Luckily it was still early in the morning when everything was still frozen in place. After the initial ascent onto the Formidable glacier, we began traversing to the right all the way to the west end of the glacier away from the fall zones. Once we finished this traverse, we continued the ascent up the glacier weaving around large crevasses. This was the most heavily crevassed glacier I have ever ascended. The snow never really exceeded 45 degrees which made the ascent fairly easy.  Morning twilight on Mount Formidable Starting across the red ledge J'burg with fog in the valley Sunrise on Spider Mountain Sunrise on Mount Formidable Climbing the Formidable Glacier Around 7:30am, about three hours from the time we left, we reached the top of the glacier and I began looking for a place to cross the serious moat. I located a small snow bridge that bridged the 50 foot abyss and gently crossed it which involved stepping over onto a small ledge which would be our first belay ledge. I set up an anchor once on the ledge and belayed Dane across. There was barely enough room for both of us. I racked up and just as I was about to stat climbing the first pitch, the bridge we just crossed fell into the abyss of the moat!! ""Well, I guess we are committed now...even before the first pitch"" I recall saying. I start up the mostly solid but rubble covered class 4 pitch which involved simply scrambling up delicate terrain. I continued up and used the entire length of the 70 meter rope only placing one piece! I call for Dane to start simul-climbing as I am midway up a steep rubble filled gully and can see a good place to set up a belay 15 feet above me. I manage to pull up with some stemming and quickly set up a belay in the only solid cracks I have seen so far. I belay Dane the rest of the way. Even though this long 80 meter pitch was rubble covered, the baseline rock was mostly solid. From my large belay ledge, I clearly see the neve couloir we will climb. Climbing the Formidable glacier Navigating the moat Looking up the first pitch Dane starts on the second pitch which was mainly a traverse across a large dirty ledge towards the base of the neve couloir. He climbs a short snowbank and makes a nice anchor at the base of the couloir, using most of the rope. I follow and quickly start my way up the couloir for our third pitch. I decide to take a picket and an ice screw. As I head up, I quickly realize the snow is easy to kick steps in and about 50 feet up I place a picket. The snow then steepens to at least 65 degrees in a couple spots and I find some good cracks to place rock pro in the right side. I remember wishing I had a second picket though. Just before I reach the end of the snow couloir, Dane called out ""end of rope"". I yell back to begin climbing and I pull through the overhanging chalkstones at the top of the couloir to another large ledge where I set an anchor and belay Dane up. Once at the ledge atop the couloir, we take a quick break and unroped, we walk around a rib and locate the base of a long section of low angle easy climbing. It's Dane's turn to lead and he starts up the mainly 4th class and low 5th class terrain. When the rope runs out I begin climbing. We probably simul-climb an additional 70 meters making our 4th pitch around 140 meters or so. When Dane reaches a steeper section just below the duolith, he makes an anchor and belays me up. We quickly switch packs and I start up the first of two 5.6 pitches of the route. I traverse to the right, then back ledge working my way up a short vertical section to the duolith. This feature is a 30 foot tower of rotten granite with a 3 foot wide crack splitting it down the middle. I climbed past this feature on its left side and made an anchor in a bomber constriction crack just above the duolith using about half the rope. Dane leading pitch 2 with the couloir above Looking up the couloir Looking at the upper Formidable glacier Looking up the 4th pitch The Duolith Dane followed and started up the 6th pitch which began as a climb up an easy leftward ramp then ascended steeper rock and zigzagging until the rope drag became a serious problem. He set up a belay in an awkward spot after using half the rope but he was unable to pull the rope through. I quickly ran up the easy ramp and helped him free the rope a bit so he could pull it. I then began climbing and the upper part of this pitch was actually a bit tricky with my plastic boots on and carrying the heave pack. I traversed back and forth testing every hold since the rock was pretty loose. I let loose two huge blocks on the way up which went tumbling down the entire northeast face! Upon reaching Dane, we didn't even switch packs and I continued up much easier terrain (Class 3 and 4) for another 30 meter pitch until I reached the crest of the north ridge. Here I sling a boulder and belayed Dane up. Once we were both on the ridge we could then relax and take in the amazing views. We ate a quick snack and I began up the last portion of the north ridge. I told Dane to tie in at the halfway point and we could simul-climb the rest of the way. Once I had a good stance, Dane tied in and we finished the route, reaching the summit at 3:10pm, about 10.5 hours from leaving Kool Aid Lake. Dane starting the 6th pitch Looking up the north ridge Dane working his way up the ridge Spider Mountain from the summit Tupshin Peak from the summit Summit splatski Mount Formidable summit panorama with Bonanza Peak, Dome Peak, and Glacier Peak Mount Formidable summit panorama with Johannesburg, Forbidden Peak, Sahale Peak and Boston Peak The South Route Descent After reading the summit register I logged it and we had a nice long break on the summit taking in the glorious views of many prominent peaks in the Glacier Peak Wilderness and North Cascades NP. Around 3:50pm though it was time to start heading down. We had the SummitPost route description for the standard south route which would prove very helpful (Thanks Paul!). We started by scrambling down very tedious class 3 and some class 4 terrain a short ways until we found a slabby section we didn't want to down-climb. I located a nice horn to sling and we made one full rappel down to some easier terrain below. We continued down traversing to the skiers left and working towards the large snowfields below. Steep cliffs barred passage to the snow below but when we got to the ledge which traverses the steep snow chasm, we decided to simply sling a huge boulder and make an overhanging rappel down to more mellow snow below, instead of trying to traverse some 55 degree snow and walk on a ledge we had no idea where it would lead. Once on the snowfields below, we plunge stepped down to the cleaver which divides the two basins on the south side of Mount Formidable. The route said to descend to 7,400 feet on the cleaver where we were then able to scramble down to the large basin. From here it was an easy snow traverse across the basin towards the crossover saddle. A short 150 foot climb brought us to the saddle where we were greeted with amazing views of the Spire Point area and White Rock Lakes below. Dane starting down from the summit Looking up the south route Looking down at the crossover saddle Reaching the cleaver Spire Point and company Spider Mountain from the crossover saddle Spire Point and company from the crossover saddle By now it was about 6:45 in the afternoon and I spotted the Ptarmigan Traverse tracks 100 feet below me. We met up with them and traversed easy snow and made the short ascent back to the Spider/Formidable col and roped up. The descent down the Middle Cascade Glacier was straightforward with a few large cracks opening up. By this point, my feet were in great pain since I had been wearing my plastic boots with Intuition liners and my feet were baking all day. We continued on the path traversing back to the red ledge. The sun had set with some vibrant colors just as we reached the ledge and it was almost 10pm when we arrived back at the tent. There was no way we were going to be able to hike out back to the trailhead tonight. I had blisters on my feet since they were so warm and sweaty all day and we both were exhausted. We went right to sleep and finished the hike out the next morning. This was a day later than we had anticipated but the thunderstorms are to blame for that. Luckily we were able to contact family and friends at a reasonable time later that morning. Unfortunately my drive from Seattle back to Renton took a couple hours due to a large amount of traffic. Just the thing I was hoping for on my welcome home back to the Seattle area! Climbing back to the Spider/Formidable col Sunset over Spider Mountain Sunset behind J'burg Twilight on Mount Formidable Morning on Formidable Mount Formidable from Cache Col Our route up the Northeast Face Conclusion This now stands as the best climb I have done in my life and one I will remember for years to come. I feel I have made many personal advancements in my climbing career with this ascent and am very happy to have shared the experience with Dane. I'll just have to see what my next climb will be but until then, I am very satisfied! Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed the photos.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/5-days-on-mt-rainier/168777,5 days on Mt. Rainier,1969-08-09,"Crevasses on the Ingraham Glacier I recently picked up a copy of Ira Spring's book, ""An Ice Axe, A camera, and A jar of peanut butter"" and found starting on page 93, his story of ""A climbing/photo seminar"" It was interesting to me since I was one of the ""students"" involved in this seminar. However, I found that his date of the seminar was incorrect, he reported it to be 1970 when in fact it was 1969 (Aug 5-9). Minor point but in reading that he only did one of these seminars, I now feel that it was a pretty special event to be involved with. Lou Whitaker, Adi Weisensteiner, Erik and one other guide were part of the staff that were with us during the seminar. What made it special was we spent five days on the mountain with Camp Muir being our base camp before we attempted to summit via the DC route. For part of those five days, we spent a lot of time over on the Cowlitz glacier doing ice & rope training, self arrests, and lots of photography under the direction of Ira Spring, who I found to be great teacher. One thing I remember very well is being down on a snow bridge with Ira while Lou Whittaker jumped the crevasse four or five times to give us that special shot I have two of these pics posted and go to photos) I'm just wondering if any of you reading this might also have been involved in this seminar and could email me sometime. Our group of twelve met at the Paradise guide center at 9 am on August 5th. After our gear was checked out some of us had to rent additional gear if what we had was insufficient. We met Ira Spring and Adi Weisensteiner and by ten we were all heading up the trail towards Pebble Creek, our lunch stop. From Pebble, we hit the Muir snowfield and made our way to Camp Muir. I was amazed that coming from Ft. Leonard Wood Missouri, the altitude gave me no problem while several of our group felt it just getting to Pebble Creek. As I went up Muir snowfield , I couldn't help but think of a Seattle dentist, Dr. James Reddick (a very experienced mountaineer), who had died not far from where I was during a freak storm that trapped him and his son in a whiteout. This had happened just two weeks before I'd had to leave Seattle for Missouri in June of the previous year. Even the benign looking Muir snowfield can be a deadly place to be during a surprise storm and whiteout. Yet as I climbed towards Camp Muir I was passed by several people going up in nothing but T-shirts and blue jeans. If an experienced climber like Reddick could die here and he was pretty prepared, what chance would idiots like these people have. Yet you see it all the time in the mountains. Oh well, enough posturing. Anyway, by the time our group and a few of us tail end charlies made it to Camp Muir"" it was late afternoon. The first evening was memorable as the cloud cover below us allowed just the tops of the major peaks such as Adams , St. Helens and Hood were visible floating above the cloud deck. The sunset was awesome. Night was in the stone hut in an oversized borrowed sleeping bag. I had borrowed all my gear from a friend in Seattle, the only thing I had to rent was crampons. Lou Whittaker came up and introduced himself to our group and brought his brother Jim, who spent the evening telling us (and answering tons of questions) about his climb of Everest just a few years before (1963) It was a great evening and I slept well that night. I didn't even know about the weather changing and 100 MPH winds hitting our ridge, flattening many of the tents outside. The next day dawned sunny and bright. After three days of truly gorgeous weather, it was time to do the climb, the main event. Our group was divided into three rope teams of four, with one of the guides taking the lead of each group. I was thankful that Lou wasn't my rope leader as the man is such a greyhound. He actually didn't participate in the climb but I didn't know that he wouldn't be climbing with us. Erik, a young man who was to take a fatal mistep on Palisade Peak the following summer was our rope leader. Just a young guy, maybe 20 or 21 but fun and reasonable, a guy I really enjoyed. When I heard of his death, it was so sobering. People can and do die in the mountains, even when it's not expected. We left Camp Muir in the dark and and headed for Cathedral Gap. It was a neat sight to see a line of headlamps bobbing along as we all headed out. Once across the Cowlitz glacier, you climb up a scree slope for a couple hundred feet until you get to Cathedral gap. I found walking up the scree in crampons to be rather weird but when we topped the scree slope, we were moving over onto the Ingraham glacier, an area referred to as Ingraham flats. We hit Ingraham flats just as the sun came up, giving a beautiful sunrise to those of us with cameras. We had started a little later than normal as all of us were pretty well acclimatized and the guides seemed confident in our newly found abilities with the stuff they had taught us. Adi would say: ""don't stepp on zee rope"" over and over and over. Hmmmm, stepping on the rope would definitely be ""Not gut"" The trip across the Ingraham glacier made me very nervous as I kept looking up at that huge ice wall that towers above you and thinking ""Please don't let loose now"" A few years later, eleven people crossing this same area weren't so lucky. Getting across to the Cleaver was interesting as a big schrund separated the glacier from the cleaver but the 'cow path' had found the one good snow bridge still present and we carefully crossed it over to the crappy rock of the Cleaver. The climb up the cleaver went easier than I anticipated as quite a bit of the route was up a suncupped snowfield which acted like stairs to ascend. These suncups gave us some great pics Suncupped snowand we made good time to the top of the cleaver. From the top, the 'cow path' veered left (southerly) and worked its way back and forth among the Large open crevasses that mark that part of the upper Ingraham. One of our group started showing signs of high altitude sickness so he was sleeping bagged and staked to a level spot by the guides at about the 13,500 foot mark. The remaining climb to the summit went faster than I had anticipated and soon the summit rocks were under my feet. What a great feeling. We had to trek across the crater to the high spot to actually stand on the absolute highest spot on the peak but several in our group had elected to stay over on the rim as they were pretty tired and was concerned about the trip back . The descent went great although about the time I hit the base of the cleaver my legs were starting to abandon me. The sewing machine legs I'd heard about and I found the remaining effort to get back to Camp Muir to be very exhausting. I really think in retrospect that you need to make sure you don't become dehydrated as there was no way that I had enough to drink for the effort that is required to climb to the summit and back. The other thing I would really make sure was taken care of is having adequate sun screen protection. I paid for my lack of attention on the summit day for about ten days after the climb. I slept well that night however, since I was as bone tired as I had ever been in my life. In fact, it was probably at that time, the hardest thing I had ever done in my life. Anyway, the book is worth a read as Ira Spring is an entertaining author and you get a feel for some of the history of climbing and photography in the northwest. One other special event occurred as I was decending from Camp Muir, I met Dee Molenaar and his son and had a chance to visit with Dee for a few minutes. Dee wrote a fine book called ""The Challenge of Rainier"" and is famous for his drawings of the northwest mountains and route diagrams that are used in many of the climbing books. I've always felt a little kinship with Dee since my name, Dean Molen, is so similar to his. A little Dutch in both of us. This photo seminar was one of those events I'll always remember fondly. Getting to the summit wasn't too bad a deal either. This pic from the net shows the route I followed on my 69 climb. I am hoping to climb Mt.Rainier before I'm 70 again with my niece's husband. Got to be in top shape at my age. It'll have to wait until after I've done Gannett, The Grand Teton, and a host of others. The goal is not to repeat a climb until all other goals have been met. Right now, I want to do all of the county highpoints in the western US and that is a full meal deal. On the way down pic Heading up the DC route.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/goat-rocks-peak-bagging-and-goats-of-course/983313,Goat Rocks - Peak Bagging and Goats (Of Course),2016-09-15,"Long Time ComingIt had been over a decade since I last went backpacking with my Dad.  After nine years living on a sailboat he was back on the main land and wanted to spend a couple nights in the wilderness.  Looking for some relatively easier options I came up with a trip to the Goat Rocks.  It had also been over a decade since I last visited the Goat Rocks so it seemed be fitting to take my Dad there for his first night in the back-country in many years.  We originally planned the trip around Labor Day, but the forecast deteriorated rapidly as the time drew near so we decided to delay the trip two weeks.  It couldn't have worked out much better.  We had nearly perfect weather forecast and on the morning of September 15th, 2016 I met my Dad at the Berry Patch trailhead at around 7:50.  By 8am we were hiking up the Goat Ridge trail! The going was slow.  The trail was a nice gradual incline through a lovely forest.  Being my Dad's first trip in a long long time we weren't out to break any speed records, rather we took our time going up the trail chatting, catching up, and resting frequently.  We caught a few glimpses of the Goat Rocks peaks and soon the trail ducked behind the west side of Goat Ridge.   Goat Rocks from Goat Ridge Trail Saint Helens from Goat Ridge Trail Hiking Goat Ridge Trail Jordan Basin and Hawkeye Point The trail then opened up with views of Jordan Basin and Hawkeye Point.  It was gorgeous and made for some awesome scenery as we continued to hike up towards the pass.  We stopped for a break and took our packs off to have a quick snack while admiring the scenery.  Once rested we continued on up towards Jordan Basin.   Goat Ridge Trail to Jordan Basin The basin was beautiful with several places to camp.  This would have made a lovely place to set up camp, but our goal was Goat Lake so we continued on.  A couple switchbacks later we were at the pass and the views of Old Snowy, Ives, and the Goat Creek basin were quite impressive.  As we made our way down the trail towards Goat Lake, Mount Adams came into view, beautiful as always.   Hiking Through Jordan Basin Me and My Dad with the Goat Rocks Trail to Goat Lake Goat Lake Trail Pano Nearing the lake we passed a section of wild flowers.  Visiting the area in September it was well past peak wild flower season, but this section of about 100 feet of trail was alive with wild flowers and the buzzing of bees.   Flowers Near Goat Lake Butterfly Bee Fires Prohibited at Goat Lake A short distance later we crested a ridge and Goat Lake came into view!  The color of the lake was striking, a sort of milky glacial blue that was quite pleasing to the eye.  We spotted several potential camp sites and descended into the lake basin where we picked out a spot that offered views of the lake, the Goat Creek basin, and Old Snowy and Ives.  The only thing our spot was lacking was shade.  There were a couple other groups camped below near the outlet stream.  We set up camp, had some food, and settled in.  My dad had had enough moving for the day, but I was in the mood for some peak bagging so I packed up a day pack and departed about 2 pm. Goat Lake Panorama Camp at Goat Lake Hawkeye Point and Johnson Peak After the casual hike in I was in the mood for some exercise so I booked it up to Hawkeye Point and made it there in about 30 minutes.  The views were amazing!  Goat Lake looked spectacular from above and the views of Old Snowy to the east, Johnson and Rainier to the north, Adams to the south, and Saint Helens to the west were stunning.  I took some photos they eyeballed a route over to Johnson peak, my next destination.   Camp from Hawkeye Point Johnson Peak from Hawkeye Point   Goat Rocks from Hawkeye Point   Hawkeye Point Benchmark Hawkeye Point Summit Panorama - SCROLL-ABLE I was hoping to take the ridge directly over but it was too rough.  I would have to descend into the Johnson Creek Basin, losing close to 1000 feet of elevation in the process.  I set off and quickly picked up the trail that descended into the basin, running a good portion of it.  At about 6500 ft I left the trail and began ascending a rib which I crested at just below 7000 feet.  From there I picked up a goat trail that traversed around towards the route I had picked out from Hawkeye.  I spotted some goat fur and caught a whiff of goat.  I looked across to the base of Johnson peak and saw some goats!  Being downwind from me, they saw me probably before I saw them.  I didn't count exactly but there were a dozen or more of them and they basically took the exact route I had eyeballed up to the west ridge of Johnson Peak, a few hundred feet below the summit.  It was interesting that we shared the same eye for route finding up the somewhat cliffy south face of the mountain.  I had fun taking photos of the goats as they made their way up.  They were a good 10 minutes ahead of me and I didn't see them again after they crested the ridge.   Johnson Peak and Goats (if you look close) Johnson Peak Goats Johnson Peak Goats (close up) Goat Train on Johnson Peak The route I picked was class 2+ / class 3-.  Soon I was on the summit of Johnson peak, 1 hour 20 minutes after leaving Hawkeye.  The cliffs off the east face of Johnson were impressive as they dropped 3500 feet down into the basin below.  I took some photos, but didn't stay too long.   Johnson Peak Chasm Johnson Peak Summit View SE Johnson Peak Summit Looking SE Packwood Lake and Rainier Hawkeye Point and Adams On the way down I decided to drop down a couple hundred feet more in elevation in exchange for picking up the trail, rather than repeat my side hill traverse that I did on the way up.  I made steady time climbing back up the trail, then descended back down to camp at Goat Lake.   Hawkeye - Johnson Route (Google Earth) Hawkeye - Johnson Route (view large for detail) I arrived at 5:30, 1 hour 20 minutes after leaving the summit of Johnson.  My dad was just boiling water for dinner.  I joined him and noticed there were 20 or so goats on the slopes to the east of Goat Lake.  We ate dinner and watched the goats, and later the colors of the sunset, before turning in early around 8pm.   Goat Lake Evening Goats East of Goat Lake Goat Lake Goats Old Snowy Alpenglow Mount Adams Sunset In the morning, I crawled out of the tent around 6:30 and took some photos of the sunrise.  After a bit of breakfast we packed up camp and headed off for alpine camp near Snowgrass Flats.   Mount Adams Sunrise Goat Lake Sunrise Sunrise from Goat Lake Camp Old Snowy After poking around a bit we decided on a nice little camp site tucked away in the trees.  This area lacked the views we had at Goat Lake, but made up for it with copious amounts of shade trees.  My dad wanted to lounge, I wanted to climb Old Snowy, so I packed up and headed up the trail towards the PCT.  After a couple switchbacks, the trail met up with the PCT in a wide open basin with great views all around.  There were a couple of huge boulders just sitting out in the open.  At this point high clouds were rolling in which added to the scenery.   PCT Towards Old Snowy Mount Adams and Boulders From there the trail entered a talus field and views of Hawkeye, Johnson, and Goat Lake came into view with Rainier off in the distance.  Such amazing views up here!  I continued up the trail following the signs for Old Snowy.  The summit block was one big pile of loose rock, but with a well defined boot path up to the summit.  One hour and forty minutes after leaving camp I was on the summit!  This was probably my favorite view of the trip and was much better than I was expecting.  The views of Gilbert and the Big Horn group with McCall Glacier below were pretty stunning.  I looked around a bit for a summit register but didn't find one.   Goat Rocks and Rainier from PCT Old Snowy Summit Block - hikers on the left Old Snowy Summit Panorama - SCROLL-ABLE Gilbert and Big Horn from Old Snowy Ives from Old Snowy Mount Adams from Old Snowy ALW Peaks from Old Snowy Mount Saint Helens from Old Snowy Goat Rocks from Old Snowy Summit Tieton from Old Snowy Mount Rainier from Old Snowy- lots of birds in this pic if you look After 20 minutes or so I began my descent, chatting briefly with a through hiker.  As I neared the junction with the trail back to camp, I met my dad coming up.  He was pretty happy to have made it to the PCT.  He walked up the trail a few feet so he could tell people that he hiked a section of the PCT.  :)  He mentioned that a hiker he talked to said the forecast was calling for rain starting around 9 am.  We mentioned this to another couple of hikers we ran into and they said the forecast they saw called for rain starting at midnight, 100% chance of rain no less.  We mulled this over on the way back to camp.  I had only brought a flimsy emergency poncho since the forecast I checked the morning of the trip called for 10-20% chance of rain on Saturday.  Not wanting to hike out in the rain with all my gear drenched we just packed up and headed out that afternoon.  The hike out was pretty easy and soon we were back at the trailhead.  On the drive home I saw three elk on forest road 21, including a huge buck, and I nearly hit a deer on highway 12.  I was in the middle of moderate traffic and the thing just dashed out of the woods and directly in front of my car.  I swerved 80% into the other lane and narrowly missed hitting it.  Thank goodness there was nobody in the oncoming lane.  Fortunately the rest of the drive home was uneventful and I was soon home to my family and a warm shower.  It was great to visit the Goat Rocks again, and even better to backpack with my Dad!  We had a great time and I'm already looking forward to next year!

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/mount-shuksan-fisher-chimneys/218055,Mount Shuksan - Fisher Chimneys,2006-08-14,"Sunday - Pig out and Slack Day Team Slack fueling up on sugary snacks at the trailhead :) The Bellingham IHOP had a line up of cellulite and blocked arteries out the door so we had to move to Plan B. After a sick size late breakfast of bacon with a side of eggs and pancakes at Denny’s, grocery shopping for outrageous snakes at Haggen’s and a bit of gear whoring at REI, Team Slack (Mike, Chris and yours truly) finally rolled into the Lake Anne parking lot around 3:30pm on Sunday afternoon. After consuming aforementioned outrageous snacks, we were out of ways to procrastinate so there was nothing to do but start hiking in to camp. Shuksan from Lake Ann We made it to camp just past the lake with stellar views of our route in under 2 hours. The rest of the afternoon/early evening was spent studying (me anyway), eating, filtering water and generally slacking although there were a few minutes of excitement when Mike spotted a huge black bear nearby. There was a woman camped next to us who told us she’d been coming here for many years and had never seen a bear. Just then a couple of guys came hiking along. They took one look at the bear and hightailed it back the way they’d come. We packed up our summit packs before hitting the sack around 10:00. I couldn’t sleep and I don’t think Chris or Mike was having any more luck than I was. We’d left the fly off the tent so we could watch the Perseids but after midnight the moon came up and made it too bright to see much. Fisher Chimneys We got up just after 3:00. I don’t know how it took us an hour and a half to get going but it did so it was 4:30 before we hit the trail. Julia & Chris in the Chimneys The first part of the trail is very straightforward (of course that didn’t stop me from getting off it) and we were making pretty good time until we hit the gully. We lost the trial here (it was dark) and started to ascend. Bad idea. The gully was heinous and I managed to almost get myself stuck. I couldn’t go down and I couldn’t go up. I managed to go sideways by hacking out holds with a small rock. Yuck. That was scary. Chris and Mike took a slightly less stupid route up but still had to contend with crappy holds. It was light out by the time we escaped the gully so we could easily see that we were up much too high and quickly descended a slippery slope to regain the trail and proceed on to the chimneys. Mike in the Chimneys Things were going well for a while but in keeping with tradition, it was time to get off route. We took a right instead of a left and things got harder and harder. Pretty soon we were on low 5th with major exposure and I went on strike. “No way… not without a rope.” Three was an old piton in the rock so we knew this was ‘a’ route but not the one we wanted to be on. Just then a solo climber appeared on the scree slope far below us moving at super bionic pace. We decided that he probably knew where he was going so Mike scrambled back down the route as fast as he could to try to intercept him. The guy was incredible. Mike almost missed him but fortunately he did manage to point us in the right direction before zooming off again. All Chris and I heard from our lofty perch was the sonic boom. Once back on the right route the climbing was fun and easy. The holds are bomber and it’s all Class 3 with one or two Class 4 moves thrown in for good measure. There was a little bit of everything… snow... scree… trail… rock and beautiful views of the sun rising on Mount Baker. Sunrise on Mount Baker Winnie's Slide As we topped out at the end of the chimneys we were greeted by Tomyhoi, the Border Peaks, Larabee & Slesse. We paused for a much needed break at the base of Winnie’s Slide, just as the sun popped out over the top to bathe us in its warm rays. Winnie’s Slide is a fairly short but steep snow slope that takes you to the toe of the Upper Curtis glacier. We used our 4 pickets to protect this section and made it up fairly quickly without any excitement. Baker was looking beautiful from the top. The mangled, gnarled crevasse ridden toe of the Lower Curtis was looking a bit daunting and didn’t get any better looking as we came closer and realized that this was our next obstacle. Mike and Chris Ascending Winnie's Slide Upper Curtis Glacier & Hell's Hwy Julia & Mike on crappy ice section The crevasse that went ""CREEEAK!"" The ice was total crap so we didn’t bother with screws. Pickets were out of the question and staring it down didn’t seem to be having any effect at all so it was time to nut up and just get it over with. I climbed on to the ice praying that my aluminum crampons would take enough of a bite out of the crappy ice and front pointed my way up. The angle eased off and I was about to start breathing again when I suddenly got a nice view of what I’d been traversing under. A massive, deep & hungry looking crevasse. “Oh my god!” I gasped as I tried to focus all my energy on becoming weightless as I tried to find a way out of the trouble. Mike soon made it up to where I was and he got out of there fast. Since his way hadn’t swallowed him up, I prepared to follow him. Just as I took my first step the glacier below my feet let out a deep, ominous sounding “CREEEAK” that vibrated through my crampons and through my whole body. Definitely time to relocate! Chris was next and we urged him to move quickly and carefully over to where Mike and I were standing. We picked our way carefully through the cavernous (but hopefully not carnivorous) crevasses up to the relative safety to be found higher up on the glacier. We met the solo climber about half way to Hell’s Highway on his way DOWN! We were still another 3-4 hours from the summit at this point. He had passed us on the chimneys and was on his way down. I asked him where he was hiding the nitrous and he explained that he was on a bit of a mountain bender, just coming off 3 weeks of climbing in the Rockies. Still, the guy was moving at a speed I’ve never seen before (and I know some bionics!) and we were very impressed. Losing elevation on the way up is always heartbreaking but there’s no avoiding it as you descend about 600ft to the base of Hell’s Highway. The views were outstanding and took a bit of the sting out of the loss. Hell’s Highway consists of two steep snow slopes with a relatively flat bench between them. The first slope isn’t as steep as the second and the runout is relatively benign if you can just forget about the enormous crevasses on your left. It’s more of a psychological problem than a technical one. The second part is quite a bit steeper and you REALLY don’t want to fall to your left. Unfortunately the left hand side is the least steep. Mike Ascending Hell's Highway Sulphide Glacier & Mr. Grumpy Pants Julia & Summit Pyramid from Sulphide Slog By the time we reached the Sulphide Glacier we were ready for lunch. We enjoyed the views over to Rainier and the Olympics under the watchful eye of the summit pyramid which looked so close but in reality was still a long slog away. Mike, Chris & Mount Baker from Sulphide Slog After lunch we slogged up the Sulphide basking in the unrelenting solar radiation that you can only experience high above sea level while traversing a surface with an albedo of 80. As we plodded along, we were serenaded by the sonorous tones of a raving lunatic on the summit pyramid. Eventually two dots on the rock come into view and as the voice got louder the dots got bigger. The dots didn’t move as we approached and eventually they materialized into a man and a woman. They appeared to have climbed themselves into trouble and my guess would be that he was scared and like the big man that he was, was dealing with his fear by yelling at her. My personal favorite was ""NO! Stop right there! You are not ALLOWED to go that way!"" We listen to this guy barking and snarling for about an hour as we approach. We reached them just as we were ascending the last bit of the snow slope to the summit pyramid. By this point they had managed to get down and were ready to get on to the snow. He seemed quite annoyed that we were in his way. ""We want to come down and we want to come down right where you are!"" he tells me. He seemed oblivious to my observation that the snow slope was huge and big enough for all of us so rather than starting a fight we got out of their way. He told us that they had not made it up and had found the climbing very difficult. He seemed to be suggesting that we shouldn't continue. Mike: ""Well, we have a rope."" Him: ""A rope is irrelevant on rock climbing like this."" Chris, Mike, Me: *blank stare* Just as we're pulling away from them, he turns and says: ""I free climb too you know."" What the hell? What exactly does that mean in this context? Bizzare. We continued on up but could hear him yelling at her for some time as they made their way very slowly down the Sulphide glacier. Summit Time! Julia Scrambling on the Summit Pyramid It was nice to get out of the rope. It was tempting to leave it behind but we thought we might need it so I stuffed it into my pack and set off behind Mike. Chris followed behind me. I had begun to suspect Mike of suffering from the same route finding affliction I am cursed with earlier in the day and his route choice here confirmed it. We scrambled up what was mostly the South Ridge rather than taking the easier Class 3 gully. The rock was solid and the route was relatively easy but the exposure was tasty. I had read too many accident threads online in the days leading up to this trip and I was paying for it. If I were to do it again I’d take some rock pro and do it right. But by the time I realized I was in a bit of trouble it was too late to go back and up was the only way out. I cursed myself for not paying more attention to the route. Mike & Chris Descending Hell's Highway We reached the summit and spent a few minutes enjoying the moment. I tried to do a summit cartwheel but after several lame attempts Mike pulled the plug in favor of not having to retrieve my body on the other side. We were running very late so we couldn’t hang around too long. I expect that I’ll be savoring this one for some time. I’d wanted Shuksan for a few years so it feels good to have done it. I scrambled around for a summit rock then we headed down via the easier route. Rappelling seemed like more trouble than it was worth so we just down climbed. Summit to Camp Upper Curtis Glacier from Hell's Highway Once off the summit pyramid we mused about how nice it would be to just descend down the Sulphide Glacier. We still had a hell of a lot of work ahead of us and we were all pretty tired. We enjoyed the easy slog across the Sulphide to the top of Hell’s Hwy which looked a hell of a lot steeper from the top than it had from the bottom. We belayed down the first and steepest section then unroped and self belayed down the longer but less steep part. Crappy ice section we managed to avoid on the way down That 600ft descent we’d done on the way up had seemed like a long, gentle slope on the way up but with tired legs on the way down it seemed to rear up before us. With the sun beating down on our backs it was a long, tiring slog. I lead us up too high so we had to descend to get back on route. Descending snow slopes on crappy snow that is balling up in your crampons through a crevasse field is not my idea of a good time. Going up was fine. You couldn’t see into the crevasses on the way up. But going down was a different story. The view before us was of the crevasse riddled glacier dropping off into nothingness. I found this to be a bit unnerving. It didn’t help that in the not so far away back of my mind I was worrying about the steep ice we’d come up on the toe of the glacier. I did NOT want to go down that and was praying that we’d be able to find a way on to the rock ridge in order to avoid it. Sunset at the top of the Chimneys Much to my relief, we were able to get up on to the rock and before long we were back at the top of Winnie’s Slide which, like Hell’s Highway had somehow steepened since we’d last met. I was about to try to get down face into the slope self belaying with my axe when Mike spotted a rap station. In hindsight we should have just left a picket up there and rapped off of it but our tired, numb minds were now fixated on the rap station. In order to reach said rap station we had to crawl into the moat between the snow and the rock and slip slide around to where about 6 slings and a couple of biners were promising an easier descent. This whole production turned out to be way more trouble than it was worth. It was the most horrible rap I’ve ever done with one foot on sheer ice and the other on jagged rock, rapping down this moat. It took forever and of COURSE the rope got stuck when we tried to pull it down so I ended up having to climb up to untangle it and then climb down the steep slope I’d been trying to avoid in the first place. It’s a good thing Mike didn’t have a knife because when he shouted down that the rope was stuck (Chris and I were already at the base of the slope at this point) I told him to cut the damn thing so we could just get the hell out of there. I’m glad I didn’t cut my new rope now but at the time I really couldn’t have cared less. The sun was setting now and we hustled to get down the chimneys, or at least the first one before we lost all light. Just before we dropped down off the glacier we were treated to a spectacular sun set. We did manage to get down the worst of it in the fading light without having to use the rope at all. Once off the chimneys, it seemed to take forever to get back to camp. At one point we were absolutely horrified to find that a snow field we had crossed on the way in was actually so thin near the edge that it had melted right through during the day! We lost the trail in the gully again but were able to find it again after Mike consulted his GPS to find our tracks. Sunset at the top of the Chimneys Camp to Home We stumbled into camp like a drunken trio around midnight. It was pretty hard to get motivated to pack and there was some talk of sleeping for a couple of hours but I had to get home to my dog who had been dropped off by the dog sitter earlier in the day because I’d expected to be home before midnight. So after a quick cup of tea we stuffed all our gear very unceremoniously into our packs. It was interesting…we all got suddenly cold. And it wasn’t very cold. We piled on clothes then piled on packs and began what would turn out to be the crux of the climb. The trail out had quadrupled in length and elevation gain/loss overnight. It was like slipping into some kind of drug induced nightmare that wouldn’t end. The wet rope in my pack seemed to weigh 100lbs and I would have passed it off to Mike or Chris if either of them seemed to be doing any better than I was. We trudged on wordlessly as the trail took on an almost tangible malevolence. When we finally reached the switchbacks we thought we were almost out but no… the pain was just beginning. Those 6 long switchbacks went on forever. I was thinking that maybe we were all being a little bit wet but upon reading a bunch of trip reports from other people, I’ve learned that this is not an uncommon experience when dealing with the last half of the Lake Ann trail. Being totally and utterly physically and mentally wasted, it seemed like a great time to drive down a mountain highway with lots of hairpin turns. Honestly, the drive home was probably the most dangerous thing we did all weekend. Nothing short of bitch slapping myself every 5 seconds could keep me awake. Mike tried valiantly to stay awake to keep me awake but it was a losing battle. Hands down the most horrible drive of my life. Never again. I must admit that I underestimated this climb. It’s not so much the technical obstacles as I’ve done more technical climbs than this as the sustained attention, effort and energy required. It really keeps you on your toes. It’s an absolutely fantastic route with a little bit of everything which keeps it interesting and makes the time (at least on the way up) just fly by. Fun scrambling, steep snow, ice, beautiful, formidable crevasses, views that take your breath away and enough of a physical and mental challenge to make me feel like a real climber. I’m so in love with this mountain but she made me her bitch. Next time I think I’d take either White Salmon or the Sulphide route down. I’d like to give a shout out to my slacker homies Mike and Chris for being the absolute best rope team and keeping me laughing even when it may have seemed more prudent to cry. Bacon forever. And remember that ropes are irrelevant. Gear 60m rope, harnesses, helmets, ice axes, crampons, CR gear, 4 pickets (used them all), 4 ice screws (didn't use). Wish we'd had some rock pro but only for that ridge on the summit pyramid. The standard route doesn't require it.

Good climb, this one is a lot of fun. It seems you took the ""fun"" way up onto the Upper Cutis glacier. When I was there the week before we considered doing what you did, but instead we stuck to the rock rib running up onto the left. Still, the ice looked like fun but I guess not so much after your little encounter, whew! My theory with this mountain is that the later in the season it gets, the crazier this climb becomes. Great pictures, especially the summit ""cartwheel"" I guess you have to take what you can get, I would hate to read an article about a woman cart wheeling her way to death on Shuksan, although that does sound funny in a funereal way! MountaingirlBC - Aug 23, 2006 5:43 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Very Nice. The ice could have been fun if we'd been able to protect it and didn't have to worry about falling through it. I guess that's sort of the nature of ice at the toe end of a glacier though. I agree.. would be easier earlier in the season but probably not as interesting. :) mauri pelto - Aug 23, 2006 8:39 pm - Hasn't voted off route nothing new at chimney Good thing you waited for the Chimney Sweep to show you the way. I have always noted on this route that a start in early light is fine, it can save time and energy. It is amazing how many people take the wrong chimney, and how many places people go the wrong way low on the route. Of course this just makes it easier for the next in line to wander off line. Next time get some glissading in on lower Hells Highway. Fine report as we expect from you. bacrossman - Aug 24, 2006 5:56 pm - Voted 10/10 Nice Great report, I think the route is often underestimated due to the large amount of actual climbing where concentration is required, especially on the descent.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/inspiration-via-east-ridge/206610,Inspiration Via East Ridge,2006-07-02,"Change Of Plans Our plan was to hit something in the Sierras over the long Independence Day weekend relying on historical data that said: North Cascades weather during this time is shit. But forecast surprised us and on Wednesday night we were repacking our junk with the intention of hitting one of our goals for the season: Inspiration Peak via East Ridge route. Good approach beta from Martin was obtained, TR's on West Mac were printed (thanks Tazz!) and we was ready. This worked out well as Shirley couldn’t really take the extra day off meant for the Sierras (work bullshit). The Pickets This was going to be our first outing to the famed Pickets Group of the North Cascades Range. We were excited. Drove to Marblemount ranger station on Friday after work and slept in the truck. 6:30 am the sound of hordes of Mounties and other permit piranhas lining up woke me up. Wasn’t particularly worried as I figured that Terror Basin can’t be that popular. Was almost wrong on this one though did manage to scoop up 2 permits. After a rich breakfast we were soon hiking the overgrown opening of the Goodell Creek Trail (~500 feet starting elevation). Nice grade but we were slowed by appetites for the abundant thimbleberries. The initial ~4 miles shadow Goodell Creek below and make for a pleasant warm-up: nice trail and nice grade. After that, the business starts: a switchback-free climbers’ boot path that quite efficiently transports one from about 1600 feet to just above timber at 5000+ feet. There was no water available between the last stream crossing on the Goodell Trail and the ~5000' bench (big waterfall there – my elevations might be off). We were both suffering. Chatting with two other guys from Seattle who were headed up for W. McMillan made for a nice diversion and we kept bumping by each other during our breaks. We lost the trail under snow at about 5200 feet but the going was fairly obvious and we regained the bootpath at an overlook point. The view from here confirmed that indeed the granite fin I’ve kept seeing through the trees was Inspiration. Shit – still farther than I’d like. Though we were prepared for a 4-day itinerary (unlike our Prusik outing the previous weekend, we had plenty of eats with us), I was quietly picturing us drinking celebratory beers at a warm beach on day 4. By the time we reached the Nelson and Potterfield endorsed camp area (via a 6K+ saddle), it was close to 8pm. We were slow. The place was crowded with climbers – most (thankfully) were headed for the West McMillan Spire. As we were racking up for the next day, 4 guys passed by and we bs-ed a bit. They were headed for the West Ridge (III 5.7 choss) of Inspiration and wanted to make sure there were going to be no traffic jams. Indeed there were none. We woke up at 5am on Sunday and were hiking & losing elevation by 5:30am. Not exactly an alpine start but we figured we’ll catch up once on the rock (not quite). We were about 15 minutes behind the 4 guys headed for West Ridge. Down and then back up we went. Elevation loss is necessary to cross the outlet from a small alpine lakelet surrounded by shear walls. Glacier crossing was fairly trivial – crevassed for sure but still with abundant snow bridges. There was also no huge moat near the start of East Ridge. We reached the rock at about 9:30am and started up at (probably) about 10 am. We saw the party of 4 guys headed for West Ridge bailing. 3 or 4 pitches to reach the notch (bet. Inspiration and the closest tower) is probably right on. We simuled the first 400 feet or so and then pitched out for the next two rope lengths. Going was run-out but pretty easy - low 5th class with singular moves up to 5.7. I was probably off-route (though I saw a fixed nut – only piece of fixed gear on the route) on this final pitch as the terrain got noticeably harder (5.8+ ?) and really loose (was forced here by a large patch of snow in the gully proper). At one point I nearly pitched off as I grabbed a hold and a 2X3 foot block came out of the rock face. Gently set it in a crack away from the rope. I could not toss it off as I did not trust my stance and thus my throw to ensure I wouldn’t hit Shirley on an exposed belay 40 feet below. Scary shit #1. Once on the ridge, the nature of the rock changed: abundant cracks and mostly solid stuff. 5.8 lieback was next which was harder than I thought it should be – I’m blaming it on my pack. Our choice of backpacks was one stupid mistake (of many) we did on this climb. Planning on a 4-day itinerary, we both brought pretty large packs with large internal frames. In short, with helmets on we really could not turn our heads to look up. Stupid. The 5.8 pitch brought us to the base of the STELLAR looking hand crack - #2 to #3 Camalots mostly (some thinner stuff higher). I led off but once near the top could not decide where to go – left or right? Ended up tension traversing (weak and tired) to the right crack and up to the notch. Couple short and easy pitches brought us to the west side of the false summit. Going was spectacular at this point – with views into the Northern Pickets Group, lone and dramatic looking Luna Peak, and of course the West McMillan Spire. Next came the best part of the day: the low 5th traverse from false to true summit which itself is an incredible sight with its overhanging south face. About 8 to 10 pitches in all if you don’t do any simulclimbing from start to summit. It was about 4 pm when we started down the west ridge – yeah no sped records broken here. The initial 3 or 4 raps went smoothly. Nice established rap stations. At this point, a snow gully appeared on the north side of the west ridge. The fixed anchors seem to run out (people drop down the south face at this point?). We wasted time scrambling around looking for the best way down. Finally spotted an old nest of slings. Two more raps and I could see that the next rap (plentiful slings visible from above) would bring us to the glacier. Happily rapped to it (~58 meters) only to find that the slings were total shit – I tore two of them with my hands. The downside of the situation was that the slings were slung around a 15-foot block. Out went the final cordallette but the set up looked flimsy and after searching around for alternatives (all loose shit), I made an expensive choice to back up the final rap station (merry Xmas to the next party through there who’s willing to take some more risk). We switched to boots and crampons and rapped 60 meters onto a snow tongue protruding out of Terror Glacier into a gully. I found a decent landing zone on a tiny rock stance inside the moat. Shirley came down and ducked as much as possible inside the moat. The ropes dropped smoothly until one end caught some blocks dislodging them. The last thing I saw was a 2X2 chunk of rock flying towards me 20 feet above as I was trying to squeeze deeper into the moat. The block bounced off the rock face above my head and harmlessly hit the snow. Scary shit #2. We belayed each other on the initial traverse above a huge crevasse and the steep downclimb. It was 7pm when we started down the gentler part of the glacier. Some route finding issues low on the snowfield were finally resolved and we made it back to camp in darkness (11pm??). In retrospect, it was a beautiful night with a half-moon lighting the southern skies illuminating tiny puffs of clouds above Mt. Triumph in the distance (though during the process, the mood was not quite that romantic: “where is THAT f…ing camp???!!”). We slept and slept till we could sleep no more. Ate a big breakfast the next morning and casually hiked out (process begins by reversing a pain-in-the-ass steep climb up to a saddle overlooking camp). Reached the trailhead at 6pm on the dot and made a quick drive to Good Food in Marblemount for some greasy food (scary shit #3). Back in Portland before midnight. The Best Part Of A Climb Happens after the climb. The next morning we picked up our dog from the kennel and hit the beach in Oregon. Three days of perfectly sunny and hot weather in the mountains and I nearly caught hypothermia on the Oregon coast. It was COLD! Went back home, fired up the bbq and let two six packs of Moose Drool carry us away on a cloud. Ahhhhhh, life is good.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/getting-lost-on-kyes-an-unexpected-overnight-stay/753825,"Getting ""Lost"" on Kyes: An Unexpected Overnight Stay",2011-09-24,"Introduction Often times when heading out to the mountains on a nice clear sunshiny day I don't expect things to go wrong. But every now and then I get one of those trips where adventure finds me. This was another round of exciting fun with bush whacking, getting lost in the dark, sliding on slippery shrubs, and everyone's favorite! Sleeping out on a steep slope. But hey, who said I wanted a tame adventure? Sometimes going through all the troubles in the end become worth while, especially when you learn from it. The adventure started out as the usual bus ride to the city of Gold Bar to meet my partner for the trip. On the way there the sunrise was looking quite beautiful, especially the golden sun beams on Mount Zekes and the red colors I saw on Mount Rainier. I was in for some stellar weather. In Gold Bar I met up with my partner Scott to head out to the trailhead. ""I'm the kind of guy who isn't so much worried about where we are going, so long as were having an adventure"" Scott announced. Sun Beams over Mount Zekes Hiking up KyesThe trip started out as a nice hike in the woods switch backing up the side of the mountain. A few miles later as we get near Virgin Lake, the views of Kyes Peak come out of the clouds as well as Glacier Peak and Columbia Peak. From Virgin Lake we start heading off the main trail and onto the beaten path. The Trail Starting Out Hiking towards Virgin Lake Wet Fungus Kyes Coming out of the Clouds A Swimming Duck Columbia Peak with Trees Purple Flowers Camping in the Meadows Virgin Lake with Kyes Approaching Kyes Peak As we get higher the bugs start to come out making stops a bit less enjoyable. In some places the trail becomes narrow and sometimes hard to find. Fortunately there are a few spots that are flagged on the trees to help guide the way. There are a few spots that may be considered class 3 scrambling even though its in the woods, but is manageable for most mountaineers. After this we get out of the forest and onto the top of the south ridge. Looking South East White Flower Purple Lupine Happy Dog on the Scramble Follow the Markers Looking Down the Scramble Looking East Rock Spire Above Looking West Columbia Peak with Blanca Lake From here we head down the saddle and take a left off the path in order to avoid the rugged ridge. This is where the brushy parts begin which unfortunately we loose a bit of elevation to a rock field. This part was kinda annoying, not because of the bush whacking so much as the slippery blue berry bushes. In some spots if your not careful, you will go sliding down a little ways. After the bush whack section we climbed back up onto the ridge which had we been on the ridge the whole time there would have been cliffs and exposure. Peak to the East The Lonely Mountain Kololo Peaks in the Distance The Friendly Booth Path The Ridge Up Ahead Looking Back at the Ridge Looking Towards Sheep Gap Scott with Glacier Peak Heading Down to the Left The Easier part of the walking through Blue Berry Bushes Then we started up a series of switch backs up the mountain with some occasional bush whacking. The trail kept going up the mountain more and more, making me wonder if we were on the right pathway for the summit. Worst case scenario if we don't make it, we'll be enjoying some great views from a high point. A little ways further I caught a glimpse of the boulder field near the summit which meant that we where going in the right direction. After a bit of a traverse we scramble over onto the boulder field. Looking Down Below Heading up The Views to the South South Face of Kyes Peak Looking up Kyes Peak Looking Down towards Blanca Lake The Boulder Field Scott has already summited Kyes Peak before and had his dog along making him worried about the summit pyramid. We both knew that we were not far from the summit so he allowed me to go on by myself to the summit. Thank goodness Scott purified some water for me which would come in handy for the later part of the adventure. Round About near the Summit From here it was a easy scramble/ hike up the ridge to the summit block. Although it was only class 2/3, I didn't like the loose rocks on it. But I suppose it has an illusion to how steep it looks in comparison to how it actually is. After a few more careful steps I reached the summit. The views were pretty good with views of the entire Mountain Loop Highway region and peaks that are visible from Highway 2. After a few pictures and snacks, it was time for me to head down. Spikey Plants Foggy Peak The Summit Ridge Flowers on the Summit Flowers near the Summit Beautiful Daisies Near the Summit The Last Few Steps Sloan Peak's Upper Slopes Looking towards Big Four Views to the South Del Campo Peak with Mount Pilchuck The Olympics Above the Ridge White Chuck Mountain Forbidden and Sahale Looking towards Eldorado Peak Gothic and Del Campo Peak Red Mountain to the North Blue Ridges to the South Mount Index and Persis Looking North West Pink Flower Summit Panorama of Kyes Peak The Gap Fall Colors near the Summit of Kyes Peak Big Four's South East Face Monte Cristo Peak Sloan Peak's South Face A half hour or so later I meet back up with my partner and we carefully go down the mountain. At first we accidentally went down the wrong ridge and had to go back up. Once we found the path again things went fairly smooth until we got back to the bush whacking. I made attempts to avoid the bush whacking by going on slippery blue berry bushes which was almost as bad. Great that I didn't have bushes in my face, but terrible footing. We did a little bit of slipping and sliding. Goat on Kyes Blanca Lake with Cliffs Goat Running Off Looking Down the Basin What a Blue Looking Lake The sun was starting to set behind the ridge which meant that we had to make good time. We had one last 400 feet of elevation gain with more loose grounds that required grabbing onto more bushes to hold yourself from slipping. At last we reach the top of the ridge which it is already starting to become evening. All around I can hear the sounds of crickets which gave the atmosphere of the place a great feeling of remoteness. People don't come here very often after all. ""I get the feeling I'm going to miss the bus home"" I told Scott knowing that it was literally impossible for me to make it in time. Columbia Peak during Evening Sunset from Kyes Looking Down the Meadows Indian Head during Evening Sunset on Mount Index Sunset on the Ridge The Sun Setting Behind the Ridge Getting ""Lost"" at NightAfter walking along the boot path it suddenly got very tricky to find the way. There were several deer paths that looked exactly like the boot path, but then would suddenly come to a dead end. ""Where could it be?"" we were both wondering. ""I found the way"" I yelled to Scott excitedly. ""Good, hope we don't have to deal with much more of this"" he replied. A moment later the trail just went straight down into the woods which did not feel right. We followed along what looked exactly like a boot path, as we crossed over a rock section the entire ground broke way under my feet. The only reason I did not fall down with the rock was because I was holding onto the rock above. A moment later it was once again another false trail. When your in a mountaineering situation that is going no where you have to keep making decisions, even if they are the wrong ones. If you don't, nothing get accomplished and your essentially stuck. I decided to do a test run to see how it was below, I would use trees and branches for veggie belays down. Suddenly it started getting real steep which concerned me, I knocked a rock down which I heard it keep on bouncing down the mountain in the pitch black woods. This was not the place to fall! As I went down it was getting dangerously steep which I finally decided I had to go back up. There were quite a few other cases where we had to go up and down trying to figure out where the path was. We knew exactly where we had come from, but could not find the path. It literally is almost as if your on trail and it disappears into thin air. Eventually I decide to take initiative and traverse the slope in hopes to meet up with the trail which of course was also a bush whack. As we pressing on upwards Scott is becoming quite tired (most people would be) and we came to a spot were we where surrounded by cliffs. ""Ugghhhh this is not going well"", I whispered to myself. ""Josh. Can we please stay the night out here? This is becoming too much."". ""Can I check up above us?"". ""Do you have to?"". ""Alright, I don't have to"" I reply in knowing that it's going to be a cold night. The crummy thing about our spot was not only where there cliffs around, but hardly any room to sleep on the sloped ground. It was a very restless night of being kept up. At first I was paranoid of the slightest noises of bushes around, but eventually that went away. ""I picked a bad time not to bring my long pants"" I announced to myself as I wrapped my jacket around my legs. Chuckling I told Scott ""Well we came for what we asked for, an adventure"". I think he may have laughed at that. Eventually I managed to get 40-60 minutes of sleep until I heard Scott shivering a lot. I eventually offered up my jacket because he had no long sleeve shirt nor long pants. This is going to be a long night. A Night in the Wilderness Waiting for the Sunrise Many hours later of waiting I started getting very thirsty. Scott had long since run out of water which meant that my 1/3 of a liter had to last between the two of us. After a full day of warm weather the previous day it had drained a lot of water out of us making us very thirsty. Being crunched up for so long on a balancing slope really makes one appreciate a nice warm bed later on. Finally we start seeing faint colors of light in the sky which we wait over an hour more for just enough light to be able to see. Sunrise Colors Hiking out the Next DayThe funny irony is that we were less than 200 feet from the boot path which it was right above us. It was humorous to find it which with light on it makes traveling it way easier. The sunrise put on quite the display that morning as we traveled down the ridge to Virgin Lake. Sunrise through the Trees Alpenglow on Columbia Peak Sunrise on Kyes Peak Big Chiwakum during Sunrise Pink Sky over Mount Daniel Columbia Peak during Sunrise Lush Green Reflection Where we stayed the Night Mushrooms on a Tree Virgin Lake Reflection during Sunrise Virgin Lake Panorama during Sunrise From Virgin Lake it was another 3 miles or so of hiking down to the car which is so much easier on real legitimate trail. The rest of the walk down was pleasant and uneventful. From the trailhead Scott took me over to his house which I enjoyed some nutter butters and a big glass of milk. Oh what a joy it was. And then I took the bus back home to get some well deserved rest. What an adventure!

single-day,https://www.summitpost.org/winter-ambition-whitehorse-in-a-day/892667,Winter Ambition: Whitehorse in a Day,2014-01-20,"Introduction After my Burgundy Spire Accident I had to give up mountaineering for a while. When I finally recovered enough to hike, a small run would be enough to re-injure my knee once more forcing me to be very careful with getting back in shape. With rare winter conditions it was painful to watch as many sunny days went by. I knew that if I wanted a shot at a spectacular climb I would have to wait until the perfect opportunity. Michael and I contacted some buddies of mine, before long we had a solid team of climbers for Whitehorse Mountain. I have been wanting to climb this mountain for many years. Gimpilator has had too many canceled trips up this peak. We were all very eager to climb this mountain. With 7,000 feet of elevation gain during January and being out of shape, this would be a big under taking. Less than half way up the mountain I was trashed, the rest of the climb was dizzyingly exhausting, but the views were breath taking. Video of our Climb by Gimpilator Beginning and the Split UpRedwic picked up Gimpilator, Michael Lewis, and I at my house the night before the climb. At the trailhead we set up our tents and eventually met up with Jacob Smith. With a few hours of rest we woke up at 2:30 a.m. for the climb. We hiked the one mile road to the trailhead. The lower trail to Lone Tree Pass wasn't bad at all. A bit steep in a few places with a small amount of brush, but for the most part is in good condition. Redwic was cruising up the trail, everyone was excited to be climbing at night with the faint light on the mountain. We did lose the trail a few times, but with a little bit of navigation we found it once more. As the trail disappeared into snow (so we thought), the brush increased. As the snow depth increased, Redwic unfortunately fell through a snow hole and re-injured his leg. Hiking up the Road Heading through the Slide Alder at Night For a while Redwic toughed it out, but knew that it could compromise his own safety and slow down the team. Michael volunteered to go down with him which we did a hasty gear exchange with a pack swap. I really didn't want to, but my brother insisted. I now had to hustle up to Jacob and Gimpilator who were now way ahead of me. As we went up, the slopes opened up more. Sunrise was on it's way and it appeared that we picked the right access way to Lone Tree Pass which was a relief. Once I finally caught up to the team, I was already quite tired. Morning Light Arrives Icy Slopes of Whitehorse Sunrise Colors to the North Hiking up towards Lone Tree Pass Mount Baker Sunrise Morning View to the West Getting Beat Down by the ApproachAs my head ache started kicking in and the cramps started up, I knew I was in for a day of pain. My food supply was severely reduced due to the rapid gear exchange, so my re-fueling supply was less than ideal. After a bit more endurance we arrive at Lone Tree Pass where Gimpilator gave me some food so that I would have just enough to make it. The back of my foot felt like it was forming a blister with each step. The boots had never been climbed in before. We hiked past Lone Tree to a great vantage point of the North Face of Whitehorse. After taking a few pictures I carefully placed my lens cap back on. I must have accidentally not clicked in one of the pieces as I put it on. Suddenly it pops off the camera and starts sliding down hill. If I really wanted to I could have made a quick step to stop it, but the slope was very exposed and was icy. I watched it fly away down the icy cliff. I was sad to see it go. North Face Tower Awesome Viewpoint of Whitehorse North Face of Whitehorse Mountain Looking Towards Darrington To meet up with the high pass gully we first needed to descend a bit and traverse the northwest slopes of Whitehorse. I managed okay due to the group speed decreasing on steeper slopes. After passing a big gully we accidentally stayed too high where it cliffed out ahead. To counter this we went through some steep woods and did some careful down climbing. Gimpilator was not pleased with this section. I decided to help kick in some steps for him (Jacob initially kicked in light steps). With a little bit of down climbing we arrived back on gentle slopes, unfortunately for me the team speed kicked back up. Slopes after Descending from Lone Tree The False Pathway to High Pass Looking over at Lone Tree Pass West Face of Whitehorse Ridge Gimpilator Hiking along a Steep Slope Looking Down on Jacob Smith Three Fingers and Mount Bullon Falling Ice and the High Pass GullyAt last we arrive in the gully that leads up to High Pass. By this point I was trashed. Everyone except for me put on their helmets, mine was back at the car because I assumed we wouldn't need them. Ice chunks started flowing down the gully on virtually every path way. Adam had a ice chunk go near his head. I was becoming intimidated by all the fast cruising ice. I would hear the rush of wind as it floated by making it a dangerous arena. The only thing that kept me from turning around was the fact that we found what seemed like the only pathway that avoided ice. On both sides of us I could see it flying by. Every now and then I would have to walk over to make sure a piece wouldn't hit me. West Face Tower Whitehorse Ridge South Tower Approaching the Whitehorse Glacier White Horse Ridge Towers Heading up to High Pass The Sun with the West Ridge As we went up the gully I became increasingly dizzy and exhausted. The ice chunks were not helping me mentally. I was falling more and more behind. My chances of making the summit were not looking good. But I knew that if I pressed on over this next section that my chances of making it would increase dramatically. Just when I thought I was very tired as it was, fatigue hit me pretty hard. After being ""fully recovered"" I would take a few steps and my heart would be racing like crazy with heavy breathing. Take a few minute rest and then a few more steps. It was beginning to look hopeless at the rate I was going and the energy I had to put out. High Pass Gully Icicles on the Cliffs Above Frozen Forest I noticed that Gimpilator was going very slow as well which ironically gave me a shred of hope. It turns out he was tired too and encountered a dicey ice section. Looking to my right I saw a frozen forest which was quite a neat sight. At the icy section I decided to take an alternative pathway that was much faster to travel through. Sometimes you have to pick obscure routes over the direct ones when climbing. At the High Pass I could finally rest and recover. The threat of ice bombs coming down on me was finally over. Jacob was already way ahead, Gimpilator proceeded while I buried all of our snowshoes in the icy snow which took a bit of time due to how powdery and icy it had become. Gimpilator with the Frozen Forest West Tower of Whitehorse Above Gimpilator in the Distance Cool Formations on the Whitehorse Glacier Crossing the Glacier and Final PitchAll alone on the blue frontier of the icy So-Bahli-Ahli Glacier, only a little more ways to go to get to the summit. While it was still tough for me, being solo enabled me to go at my own pace. The icy landscape all around was incredible. The Western Edge of Whitehorse Heading to the Summit Looking at the Summit Once Gimpilator reached the final 60 degree snow slope, Jacob threw down the rope for a belay. By this point I caught up and took a nice rest. Once Gimpilator was up, it was my turn for the exciting final push. At first I thought about soloing it like Jacob, but decided with how tired I was and how icy the landscape was that being roped up would be a nice luxury. High Pass from the Glacier The Final Slope Ascending the Summit Block (Jacob Smith) After climbing the slope, with a few more steps I was on the summit! Gimpilator and I could hardly believe it. The views were spectacular and the weather was very friendly. After a short while on the summit we started the rappels down to the So-Bahli-Ahli Glacier. Views to the East Gimpilator, Jacob, and I Jacob on the Summit Looking Down the South Face Mount Bullon Below Three Fingers with the Sun Whitehorse Ridge from the Summit Ridges and More Ridges Gimpilator Rappelling off the Summit Heading DownJacob took out the anchors and down climbed the steep snow slope to the glacier. Eventually the group passed me, I blame my photo obsession a little bit for that. ;-) At High Pass Gimpilator told me to use his helmet. I knew I couldn't convince him otherwise, so I accepted the offer with a shred of guilt. Lucky for us there was very little falling ice on the way down. Even going down was tiring for me, I could not go as fast as everyone else. Sun Setting Behind the Ridge The High Points of Whitehorse Gimplilator Headind down to High Pass Traversing over to Lone Tree Pass Once we were down the gully we made haste and traversed over to Lone Tree Pass which went alright. The up hill part was tiring. As we get near the pass, the sun begins to set.

This did not mean everything was holly and jolly yet. I once again fell behind, but this time I actually lost the group. The slopes all around became very icy and I had to make sure I didn't slip with each step. Being tired with crampons on is not a friendly combination, especially when your very dehydrated, your out of shape, it's almost dark, your out of food, your team is fast, and you don't know where they are. I tried going faster but then would either slip or almost take a nasty fall. My injured knee was hurting once more. On the bright side the sunset had some nice colors. Heading Down during Alpenglow Icy Slopes during Sunset Sunset Colors over Whitehorse Finally I could hear Gimpilator yelling in the distance which was comforting. I yelled back, eventually we met up again. Unfortunately we list Jacob somewhere in the process. To save time we decided to break away from the path we came up and we took a side gully. Eventually we managed to find Jacob before it got too dark. After descending a ways more we began a hunt for the trail. Using some tracks, a GPS, and some trouble shooting, we found the trail. On the trail I was making great time considering that there was no ice. There were times I had to wait for the team. We arrived at the trailhead at about 7:50 p.m. I was so excited to make it down. Redwic had driven Michael home and went for a mini hike that day and waited to pick us up. I was glad to see he was in good spirits. While this is a cool mountain, it trashed me pretty good. Not bad for a physical wreck. ;-) Gimpilator wrote a trip report on NWHikers about this climb.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/permitted-on-forbidden-peak/822777,Permitted on Forbidden Peak,2012-09-21,"PrologueWho: Josh Lewis and I What: Climb of Forbidden Peak West Ridge When: September 20-21, 2012 Why: For a fantastic classic alpine climb! Climbing Forbidden Peak has been something Josh has always wanted to do. After just coming off our big trip to Boston Peak where I saw Forbidden Peak for the first time, from all angles, I became very excited about it and put it at the top of my priority for the remainder of the year. We planned for the Torment Forbidden Traverse and toyed around it for quite awhile but we just couldn't find a time for both of us to get it going. Then when we finally did find a time, Gimpilator invited us both to his Dome Peak and Spire Point trip for the same weekend. Since I really wanted to meet him, this trip got delayed once again. Come mid-September, we finally found a time for the climb. We chose a Thursday and Friday to try and avoid crowds in Boston Basin. Knowing that we both didn't have quite enough experience to do the Torment Forbidden Traverse quick enough for the time we had, we decided just to do the West Ridge rated 5.4. On the morning of September 20th, I picked up Josh early and I could tell he was excited. He express to me he had wanted to climb Forbidden for years. We made the drive to the trailhead and upon driving up the Cascade River Roadwe noticed the smoke in the air. Although I was slightly disappointed, the crisp, clear air and unsurpassed views we had on our Boston Peak trip was more than fulfilling for views and photos. This trip was all about the climb and the quality route suited very well for a team like us who are relatively new to alpine rock climbing. Upon reaching the trailhead, it was very warm. The sun had just rose and we already saw snow and ice falling off the north face of Johannesberg. We could hear it almost constantly. Some day, I will climb this peak but for now, Forbidden Peak was the goal. Forbidden Peak sunset from Klawatti Col Forbidden Peak at dusk Forbidden alpenglow Boston Basin ApproachWe began up the trail leading up Boston Basin. It was actually in decent condition for most of the way except for the annoying part through the avalanche chutes. Here it was fairly rooted and overgrown but easy to follow. We had our packs full of technical gear and overnight gear. This was by no means the first time Josh had been up Boston Basin since he had come up this was on one of his Sahale Peak climbs. However, for me it was my first. Boston Basin is a massive place stretching from Sahale and Boston Peaks all the way to Mount Torment. The trees end abruptly and you break out into beautiful meadows. I was in awe at the views of Boston, Forbidden and Torment. It was a great new perspective of the area. We had a great view of the Torment-Forbidden traverse and I thought to myself...someday! Boston Basin Boston Basin Glow Sunset from Boston Basin Boston and Quien Sabe Glacier We continued up higher into the Basin and the views of Johannesberg across the Cascade River Valley just got better and better. Soon enough we made it to where we wanted to camp high up in Boston Basin. Views of Forbidden Peak were amazing and I was very excited. We set up camp and by this time it was about noon. I convinced Josh we should just relax for the rest of the afternoon since I knew it would take us forever to climb it. So we just enjoyed the beautiful afternoon and took a nap. I was unusually tired for whatever reason so I had no trouble sleeping from about 2pm all the way until the next morning with a short time up to take some sunset photos, and man what that one beautiful sunset! We agreed to wake up right at first light and start up. We saw a couple groups heading down that afternoon but they had all been on the traverse. We got some nice information from them. What was really striking though is that all night long we saw moving headlights on the east face of Mount Torment. They were really in trouble since we saw their lights all night long. We never saw them the next morning but we figured they made it down. Crevasses all the way to the glacier bottom Camping in Boston Basin The ClimbThe next morning we got up quickly and was surprised how warm it was. We started up the slabs that have been exposed in recent history due to the receding glacier just south of Forbidden Peak. Water was flowing freely down these exposed slabs that have recently seen the light after thousands of years buried under glacial ice. Ascending these slabs was quick and easy but it's important to stay left (west) to avoid some cliffs above the designated camping area. We hit snow and put the crampons on. We didn't even bother to rope up since this glacier is only a few feet thick. All the crevasses we saw were at most five feet deep and we clearly saw the rock below. This glacier doesn't have much life left. We continued up, circling around some moats near the top and made it to 7,500 feet at the top of the snow. Getting up and over through the final moat was a bit of a challenge. We had to step over but there was open air quite a ways down between the rock and snow so I put my back on the rock face with my crampons on the side of the snow and shimmied across to easy terrain. From there we stashed our snow gear and scrambled up a chossy, loose chimney to the base of the three cat scratches. The traditional route follows the deep couloir that was off to our climbers left but since we were there so late in the season, the couloir was so dry and icy so that was out of the question. With beta from Steph Abegg's trip report we planned to take the ""catscratch variation"". To the left of the deep couloir, there are three distinct small gullies. The easternmost gully, the one closest to the deep couloir is the one we ascended and the one you want to use if you climb this route in late season. Hiking the easy slabs Looking up at Forbidden Peak Heading around a moat Looking down the small glacier Looking up at the class 4 part of the correct cat scratch gully We began by ascending the initial 4th class section at the base of the gully. We started by free soloing the climb but after I got a little off route and climbing some exposed 5th class we decided to simul-climb the rest of the way. So we roped up and I led the way up the steep but pretty simple gully placing pro occasionally whenever I saw a nice crack. We continued all the way up to the top of the gully, which got more mellow the higher we went and we saw many rappel anchors everywhere since this is the standard descent for anything on Forbidden or the traverse Just below the notch in the west ridge, a near disaster occurred. There was about 50 feet of rope between us and right as I topped out above the gully and began climbing the final feet to the notch a beach ball sized rock broke loose just a few feet above me and began falling down. Luckily I was able to jolt to the right and slide the rope to the side. The rock barely missed the rope but was hurdling down towards the gully we ascended which Josh was just about to top out of. I yelled rock as loud as possible and he saw it and was ready to move. Thankfully though the rock caught on a small rib and it took a turn to the skiers left and went flying down the valley just to the west of the one we ascended, which is the middle cat-scratch gully which isn't usually climbed. After brushing it off and listening to the rock fly down the mountain, we finished our way to the notch. From here we got our first views towards Eldorado and Klawatti which was our location for fun just the month before. Forbidden Peak Looking down gully Smoky Peaks Final scramble to the notch Climbing up the Cat Scratch Views down to aqua blue Moraine and Klawatti Lakes blew my mind and add to that we had a perfect view down the spine of the Torment-Forbidden Traverse to our west and the objective, the west ridge lie above us to the east. We took a short break to eat and started up the ridge. For the most part this ridge was 3rd and 4th class but there were the occasional 5th class sections. All the rock was fantastic quality and solid as can be. We passed by only one other group on their way down just as we reached the crux tower. The hardest move of the climb was a short 5.6 slab which was easily protected by a permanent piton. This short slab is just below the large 100 foot tower. This tower was actually simple as we just traversed left onto the northern face rather than climbing the tower face itself. This crux area was the only part we full on pitched out. The rest we just simul-climbed. The traverse from the false summit to true summit was a small bouldering move. I just belly slid down the small 6 foot drop and traversed the 20 foot narrow ridge to the true summit with Josh right ahead of me. The exposure along the entire ridge was thrilling but being roped in made it no problem at all. We were standing on top of Forbidden Peak and I gave myself another huge confidence boost in what I am able to do. We both took in the beauty of the summit and sat there in complete solitude with great, albeit smoky views in every direction. What a fantastic place! Starting the W ridge Forbidden Peak N Ridge Climbing the crux tower Me on the false summit Josh summitting Forbidden Success on Forbidden Climbing the W Ridge Looking down the West Ridge The DescentThere came the time where we had to start down which is never the fun part of the day. I always tell myself that if I ever get enough money someday I'll buy a helicopter and hire a pilot to pick me up from every summit I climb...lol. So we traversed back to the false summit and began rappelling. One after another...after another...and another. Ten rappels in all brought us back to the base of the cat scratch gully. We found that rappelling the west ridge was not as bad as we were told. Anchors were found everywhere and once we reached the notch once again it was lots of rapping then pulling the rope. We finally reached snow again and made our way over the large moat and from there we made very quick time down the snow. The descent back to camp was easy and we were greeted to another brilliant sunset as we broke camp. We noticed clouds creeping up the valley far below and we soon realized that a big part of the hike down will be in foggy conditions. This really made for some great photos though. Just as we reached treeline again heading down Boston Basin it got dark and the ensuing hike out on the trail was long and disorienting. We finally reached the car and I was thrilled to have just climbed Forbidden Peak. Mount Torment West Ridge Josh rapping the crux Josh on his way down Me rapping down Finally done! Finishing the last rappel This turned out to be a major turning point in my mountaineering career along with my ascent of Boston Peak just a month earlier. I realized I can start really climbing technical rock in the alpine...something I never thought I would ever do just last year. This trip gave me the confidence to tackle this climb which would mark another milestone for me as I lead one of my first alpine multi-pitch climbs. I plan to start climbing much more technical rock more extensively next summer and I have goals to make 2013 even better than my stunning 2012 year. Thanks Josh for coming and for providing photos.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/mount-olympus-north-ridge-5-4/942306,Mount Olympus North Ridge (5.4),2015-06-05,"The LegendOlympus seems like one of the mountains of legend that I've heard about all my life. When I was a kid in the boy scouts I would hear about it in native folk lore as like the guardian of the great waters. The name is certainly lent from Greek mythology and conjures God-like proportions. The 18 mile approach alone requires warrior-like stamina. This is where the gods do battle. Its walls are sheathed in titans of ice. But words alone don't do it justice... On June 4,2015, Josh Lewis, Matt Lemke and his girlfriend Jayme invited me to join them on a 3 day climb of the North Ridge route of Mount Olympus. We chose this route for its solid rock and because reports claimed that the moat at the base of the climb had already opened. For me, it was an amazing sounding climb because I had been thinking of Olympus for the past 10 years. The miles had me a bit intimidated but I knew I've done worse. Just in case I packed some ibuprofen and a knee sleeve to help with my old injury from Reynolds. Before beginning we all agreed, with regard to the excellent forecast, to pack as light as reasonably possible for the 3 days. We shared one stove and went totally minimal. Nobody's pack weighed more than 35 pounds and I want to think that was integral to our success. Day 1 - Hoh so far to goDue to the ferry and other logistics, we had a late start to the day (11am) and tried to make the best of it by deciding to keep going until mile 5. Within the first few miles I came across a small black bear in a tree that someone hiking out told us about. I didn't notice it at first until I saw branches coming down. The critter was climbing the tree in a hurry so I couldn't get still video but it didn't stop me from trying. Somehow the rest of the crew missed it. We did all the touristy things like standing between two old-growths and taking pictures of frogs and moss, which is funny since we pretty much live around that kind of stuff. It was probably just to break up the tedium of steady marching. starting out dudes fishing nervous black bear toad tree stemming olympic rainforest When we got to 5 Mile Island, we noticed that the trail had washed out near one of the camps due to the Hoh River changing course. This prevented access to a view point of Mount Tom I remembered from a hike with Josh 9 years ago. We had lunch here and watched pollen fall like snow below the overcast skies that were beginning to open up. Our original goal was Glacier Meadows but as the day went on this seemed increasingly unlikely despite perfect weather. At the Olympus Ranger Station, it became clear we would have to camp lower since we were all tired. I have trouble maintaining energy when I can't see my objective and I wonder if this was true for anyone else. Matt joked that we'd only go 4 miles then break, then 2, then 1, then 0.5, which of course is closer to the truth. Where did the trail go through the forest Olympus Ranger station bench sign and bench Lewis bros at Lewis camp We took a long break at mile 12.4 and I got in a little nap. Awaking refreshed but low on daylight, I charged up the mountain, crossing a deep gorge and put out quite a sweat up the switchbacks with Josh working hard to keep up. We got a little ahead and made it to Elk Lake before dusk. Without good water, though, it seemed like a better idea to go to the camp a quarter-mile lower to be near running water. I was also enticed by the prospect of fire-roasted marshmallows being that it was the last place where fires were allowed. But it turned out the wood was too wet to get anything more than hot coals and a flicker from mist and rain earlier in the week. We hung our food on the NPS bear wires which were novel to me. Josh encountered a bear that was climbing around in a tree near our tent later that evening which had him spooked. So I helped him move our tent closer to Matt's and further from the food. Even though I forewent a sleeping pad to save weight, opting instead to use my pack as insulation, I slept like a rock and dreamed deep. deep gorge view at creek near camp Day 2 - Wow!Despite earlier plans to wake up at some heinous hour like 3am, we slept in until 9 to be more rested for our day and started out strong. For some reason I felt super-fast and had to take the 60m rope to slow myself down. Morning shade kept the hiking cool in the dewy meadows and weepy woods. I was shocked both by the lack of snow as the views started opening up. Arriving at the ladder, I was somewhat disappointed to discover it required a drop instead of a rise which meant it had to be regained on the way out. This and many other features on the hike have me inclined to think the elevation gain for the climb is often wildly underestimated. Glacier meadows were beautifully showy with flowers already beginning but I was still wondering where the mountain was having not seen it the whole time except for a small glimpse of Snow-Dome. We were all very low on water (a recurring theme) and passed up the opportunity to refill before the moraine thinking we could use the edge of the glacier. A goat stood above watching guard over us while marmots scurried hither and thither on the rocks. By 11am I finally saw the mountain and just had to let out a lungful of ""WOOAAAHHHW!"" at the amazing beauty of the Blue Glacier. Matt and Jayme Jayme going down the ladder by Matt me on the ladder. Taken by Matt Glacier Meadows taken by Matt Lemke Marmot stare Mount Olympus Blue Glacier panorama by Matt Lemke Jayme and Matt in front of Olympus Olympus and heather We decided to have an early lunch to fuel up for the climb and save weight. Unfortunately Jayme had developed intense pain in her feet and knee over the course of the hike in, probably similar to my awful experience on Reynolds and we were worried about how she was doing. After much deliberation, Jayme decided to leave us at the moraine and head back down to camp due to the injury. We pressed on as a team of 3, dropping hundreds of feet onto the glacier where we noticed a peculiar phenomenon, probably common on larger glaciers that I hadn't noticed before. Rocks were strewn so numerous that it looked like we were still on a moraine but we could hear running water. It seemed like the prequel to a rock-glacier. Josh and I were out of water and thirsty so we looked around and found a neat little icy hole where water run-off ran down to oblivion. After following the rocks as far as we could up the more stable ablated ice we roped up and I led trying to avoid melt-water pools by staying close to the ablation line. I really regret not taking a photo of all the thousands of tiny water pools in the ice with small rocks in the middle of them. Going through the ablation line sucked because the snow was very slushy where it transitioned and it was hard to determine where crevasses were. I accidentally stepped in some slush and my boots were instantly soaked for the rest of the trip. Damn. Well, once past the ablation line, the snow was only semi-soft and good for kicking steps. I aimed for a snowy ramp that had footprints leading up Snow-Dome. After a series of crevasses we arrived at some rocks part way up the dome where we refilled water. I have to thank Matt for taking good pictures of this section. I lead towards Snowdome. Taken by Matt Lemke part way up Snowdome looking at the icefall. Taken by Matt Lemke Josh following up Snowdome Snowdome Selfie Snowdome Olympus Station I relinquished the lead to Matt who had us flying up Snow Dome's steep sides in no time. There were a few crevasses easily bypassed. At the top of the dome we could see a shack with a solar panel and some radio equipment. Don't know if its a weather station or snotel, but some foot prints clearly led to it and above. It would've been nice to explore but it was out of the way so we kept pushing. To the South, we could clearly see what was now going on with the route. Bergshrunds crossed all the way across the early season routes and even our backup via Crystal Pass to the East was looking like it was beginning to wear out. I couldn't imagine how difficult Olympus was going to be later this year and thankful to be doing it when we did. As we approached Crystal Pass I was beginning to feel drained. Our pace slowed a little and we navigated a hidden crevasse. Matt leads to Crystal Pass Even Crystal pass is getting thin. Taken by Matt Lemke looking back where we came from climbing up to Crystal Pass Matt at Crystal Pass The view at the pass was amazing with what seemed like a whole other mountain and glacier on the other side, probably the middle and East peaks. We continued up spiraling West over a handful of small crevasses and over the false summit. The other side had a few feet of some treacherously icy corn snow that luckily turned back into slop near the flat bowl below the final snow-finger to the rock climb. Once we got up the snow-finger, Matt set himself a belay to get across a moat that spiced up the beginning of the end. The climb was mostly 4th class with a few 5.4s thrown in short bursts, 1 pitch in total. Matt placed a couple cams in and we all made the summit by 5pm. Josh and I high on Olympus on the other side of Crystal Pass. Taken by Matt Lemke coming down the false summit. taken by Matt Matt with Valhallas below Olympus' summit Olympus summit from the false summit Matt climbing on the North Ridge Josh is stoked! Taken by Matt Lemke Matt belays Josh Josh nears Olympus summit Mount Tom Signing in on Mount Olympus we made it! taken by Matt Lemke The view was expansive and I really wished we could stay longer but a few things set us going down the mountain in a hurry: 1) Matt was concerned for how Jayme was doing and didn't want her to wait in camp too long. 2) Some un-thoughtful asshat had taken a massive dump on the summit producing a fowl odor that made lingering unpleasant. 3) The now soft snow was sure to set in within a few hours and become icy and tedious to descend. So we rappelled down to the snow-finger, dropped to the bowl, marched up the false summit and then Matt started bolting down the mountain. We were going so fast that at one point he would shout, ""Crevasse!"" and then I would say the same a second later, ""Crevasse!"" and no sooner did I announce this than he came across another and another all the while running and jumping. It was hard to keep up with all the ""running"" ax belays but the rush was thrilling. We probably got back to the pass in less than an hour. From here we slowed down the pace until we got back to Snow-dome's slopes. Then we became a mess of standing glissades and plunge-step-running, slipping and sliding all over the place. Crevasse activity through this section was minimal so we weren't quite on edge until we arrived at some loose avalanche debris where we slowed down. The view of the ice-fall here is impressive and with the sun setting it felt massive. Olympus west false summit A look back Matt heading back down We managed to find a line through the lower Blue Glacier that avoided the mush from on the way in until we found a route on solid ice similar to the one we were on on the way in. Heading back up the moraine wall I realized we were gaining quite a bit more than 100 feet and found the hard packed dirt and loose rock quite bothersome after the long day. I decided to stay at the top of the moraine and catch the sunset while Matt and Josh went back to camp. I took it easy, wrung out my socks and munched some cookies while the mountain's shadow slowly shifted across the Blue Glacier. A lack of clouds made it far less dramatic than I had hoped so eventually after dusk enough mosquitoes convinced me to give up and I worked my way back down to our camp at 2,600' keeping a strong pace. The air was hot and humid, not at all like it was on the way up and got worse the lower I got. By the time I got to camp it was awful and I sat down to rest. Almost immediately my back seized up in pain and I felt like vomiting. I made a concerted effort to hold it in. I began sweating bullets. I really didn't want to lose any more fluid since I could feel the burn on my skin from the sun and I hadn't had quite enough water. All I could do was lay down in the tent. Josh really helped me get everything going from cooking to filtering water and I recovered before going to bed. He's a hero in my book. Mount Olympus from the moraine Day 3 - Hobbling homeAgain we slept in after a full day of 6k gain on glaciers. We didn't get going until the sun was beaming close to vertical in the forest. I finally managed to get a fire going and made one sad roasted marshmallow that looked like cancer. After eating breakfast and packing up I stayed behind to try to regain some of the lost water from the previous day. The 2 mile drop back to the bridge was quick but going back up-hill several hundred feet immediately afterwards was a pain. An ipod I brought along helped me get through some of the miles until I caught them back at Olympus Ranger station. Wanting to catch the ferry home we didn't stay long and I fell behind to eat the last of my food. I caught them again at 5 Mile Island where we mustered up the courage for the last few painful miles. My boots were still damp and my feet were destroyed. We all arrived at the trail head at 6:30pm glad to have made it. back at the car recorded on an Olympus camera I made a bonehead mistake of leaving my camera on the car roof and thought about it 1 minute into the drive back when I wanted to review my pictures. Luckily it wasn't damaged and I even managed to take one last video clip before the battery died again. The drive back went by in a blur while Josh and Matt discussed future plans for the summer including Mount Waddington. Catching the second to last ferry out and ordering some pizza near home finished this great journey.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/the-perfect-rainier-trip/532042,The Perfect Rainier Trip,2009-07-20,"Special Thanks Looking at Liberty Cap Special Thanks Before I write this trip report I must gives thanks to all who made this success possible. It wouldn't be right to write a trip report without a special thank you to them. This mountain really was The Perfect Trip 1. I must give thanks to my leader Russell and rope and organization leaders Anna, Ben, Pete, Alicia, and ""New Zealand"" Pete. Russell knows this mountain well and did a great job organizing this special trip while the rope leaders were perfect in leading us through the tougher sections of the mountain. 2. The climbing partners who all stuck in there together and helped each other out with gear and encouragement. A special thanks goes out Marek who got the tent for us on the trip. 3. The ""sherpas"" which is a group of volunteers that actually help bring up gear from the bottom to Camp Muir, and will greet you on the way back with food and cookies. It almost makes me cry to think about how they help us. 4. Mount Rainier. That mountain REALLY wanted us on the summit. I never thought in my wildest dreams that I would be standing on the summit with 30 degree weather with 10 winds and perfect views (we could see everything above the fire) 5. My wife for letting me go up this peak knowing how dangerous it could be. One day when your health recovers I hope to lead you to your share of summits. 6. OSAT who and it's volunteers who set up the course and helped us throughout all of the climbs. I plan on giving back my time to this very special club. Thanks to all for making this the best climbing memory I have ever had. The shot from the summit The trip reportThis well organized trip started on Saturday July 18th. All of the groups and ""sherpas"" started out in Paradise with decent weather. With all of our gear we set a slow but steady pace up to Muir and made it there in a little under 5 hours. The ""sherpas"" were a MASSIVE help in getting us to Camp Muir. I hope to do this next year a couple of times for next year's groups. It was uneventful and actually much easier than I was expecting. At Camp Muir we decided to rope up and head to Ingraham Flats. Crossing the first glacier was simple but cutting through the scree on Cathedral Gap was a little challenging. It was the first encounter we had with that volcanic scree and it woke us up a little. Anna did a great job leading or rope team through this tough section. Fairly soon we were at Ingraham Flats and setting up or tents.  Muir Peak from the Cowlitz Glacier  Little Tahoma right in front of Ingraham Flats That night though it was windy. Winds at the camp were about 30 miles per hour. But all of us did a good job in setting up our tents and making ourselves comfortable. Since we were not going for the summit the next day every one took it easy and many of us slept well that night. The next day was the acclimatization day. To me this is the most critical part of the trip. I had worked 75 hours between two jobs this past week and was very tired. At the Flats, between the first night and the acclimatization day I received at least 20 hours of sleep. Russell, our leader, as well as many others in our group were gathering information from the climb teams who went that preceding day and were tactically setting us up for summit day. It was windy the morning of acclimatization but the winds were dying down and Big Tahoma was letting us know it wanted us to visit her. Looking over at Little Tahoma July 20th-Summit day From the summit of Rainier We woke up at 10 pm and started for the summit around 12am. Russell set a great slow pace for us. We crossed the Ingraham Glacier and then hit the Disappointment Clever. In my opinion the Clever is clearly the crux of the trip. It is home to a number of rockfalls, has exposure (though we could not see it at night), and a nasty mix of scree, rock and thin snow. We cautiously went up this section and took our time through this section. Communication was good between the rope teams and went through this section pretty well. We continued on up at a slow but steady rate up mountain where we were welcome with a well laid out route and good weather conditions. The weather though was perfect. Big Tahoma was really wanting us there badly. We crossed six or seven crevasses in all, one which was 4 feet wide but had a thin stepping board across it. It was beautiful to look into the crevasses but a little scary so I unfortunately did not get a good picture of them. We had a good steady pace. None us were struggling with our breathing yet we made good progress up the mountain. I thank Russell for setting the pace because he, as with Mount Baker, gets us to the summit in good shape. I pray I get the chance for many more climbs with him. His leadership, organization, as well as pace setting, is a role model that I hope to incorporate in many of my trips. Considering we were a group of 11, that was very good. We were past by only one climb team and two soloist. One of the soloist actually pasted us again going down. He made it to the summit from Camp Muir in 2 hours 20 minutes. I know he wasn't bluffing either because that guy was going at an Iron style pace and wasn't evening breathing heavy. It was like he was going up Si. My guess was either he was a ranger or this guy was taking full advantage of his year round climbers permit. After all the Rainier climbers permit is like an all you can climb season pass for one year.  Looking down at Little Tahoma We saw the sunrise come up. My pictures did not come out well here but trust me, this was beyond amazing. The colors of the sunrise were something I will never forget. You see Jefferson, Hood, Adams, Glacier Peak, Baker going up. We made it to crater shortly after 6:30 and the true summit log shortly there after. For the first time ever we ran into the Emmons OSAT team which was actually hitting the summit at the exactly the same time. The meeting was clearly a first and was something that even the climb leaders were practically in tears about. Columbia Crest had amazing views, which was actually a surprise. I heard horrible stories about how this peak was so high up that they were disappointing. Add on St. Helens here and you were home to seven volcano views as well as some great shots that some of the lower mountains. Looking north from Columbia Crest   Our team enjoying a sunny day All of us had a short get together, and said the OSAT anthem. We then signed the summit log and then packed up to head down. We had to move quickly because one of our members was getting altitude sickness (luckily not HACE and HAPE). She was a trooper but the high elevation was beginning to take it toll once we were on the summit for a bit.  Little Tahoma from just below the crater  Looking south at Saint Helens and Adams  Our team breaking We headed down from the crater at a slow but steady clip. It was breathtaking looking at Little Tahoma and the eastern mountains though there was now a haze beginning to form from some sort of forest fire below. We made it down to the top of the clever at a good clip and the snow had only began to soften. The crevasse that had a board now had a ladder with two boards. It is apparent that the crevasses are really starting to open up now. I would hate to see this crevasse next month. Then came the Cleaver. The snow was nice above but not here. This was the crux of the trip. I sweated from nerves more that effort here. The snow had clearly softened up and footing was poor which is not much fun when you realize one wrong slip and you are going places. Communication through this section was key and Anna our rope leader lead us through the Clever and the tougher footing safely. The scree and the scree/snow, loose rock mix was tough on the nerves but that is why climb with good people and Anna did a great job showing us through this section. Once off the cleaver it was back to camp. A couple more small crevasses were now opening up and we did see a serac fall safely off in the distance. We packed up camp and then headed down. The haze from the forest fire was clearly beginning to block views. Hopefully in the next couple of day we get rain because it is going to be very hazy otherwise. Cathedral Gap and it's nasty scree was a little interesting but not nearly as bad as the Cleaver. Once through the gap and past the glacier crossing we were back at Camp Muir. During the Glacier crossing Mount Adams was looking like a beautiful gem, standing above the haze mystically. It was like it was greeting me and congratulating on topping it's big sister an reminding me about my great trip last year. Maybe I am still full of emotions but it was quiet a sight to see and a good reminder of that wonderful trip with my friend Jason.  From Camp Muir. Notice the haze from the fires We were greeted by a number of ""sherpas"" who greeted us with watermelons, potato chips and hugs. Then all of us made the long 4700 foot trek back to the bottom. On the way down I was able to snag 500 in a couple of glissades. But after that summit long trip I was beat and it took me about 3 hours to get down to Paradise. When we got down we signed out and headed to a good Mexican Restaurant in Eatonville. It is hard to rate trips but this one ranks up there as one of best experiences of my life. Because of the weather, the views, the great support from group, the meeting of the groups, it clearly doesn't get any better. This is a trip I will remember for the rest of my life!  Last look at Rainier for the trip Images View The Perfect Rainier Trip Image Gallery - 19 Images Comments Post a Comment Viewing: 1-3 of 3 Redwic - Jul 21, 2009 1:42 pm - Voted 10/10 Congratulations!!! I'm glad you made the summit of Mount Rainier. Although you were using sherpas to help out with gear and food, and you did not supply a traditional EastKing summit pose, your accomplishment is still well deserved after many months (and years) of training. You and your crew should be very happy, especially for having such great weather on such an unpredictable mountain. EastKing - Jul 21, 2009 2:05 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Congratulations!!! It was a great trip with a great caring group of people. Honestly though I actually like that pose on Rainier. I was so caught up with emotion and I think the picture really reflects that. I thought it was interesting comparing my avatar pic I have now to my Adams avatar pic. The strange thing was on Adams I had a picture of Rainier in the background (to show where I was going to) and on Rainier I had a picture of Adams (where I came from). Both mountains I had the greatest of weather I give great thanks to that. Augie Medina - Jul 22, 2009 5:50 pm - Voted 10/10 Nice TR What a difference a week makes.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/gun-shots-fired-but-still-a-success-on-mt-larrabee-winchester-mountain/644550,"Gun Shots Fired, But Still A Success On Mt Larrabee & Winchester Mountain",2010-07-25,"BackgroundThis marks the first trip that Gimpilator and I have done together. We met on the Perry Creek Trailhead this last February for the first time. I had finished Stillaguamish Peak and he was just heading up Mt Forgotten. In meeting each other in person, we discovered that we both were members of Summitpost.org. This started off comments back and forth over photos and trip reports. The timing worked out just right and Gimpilator planned a trip for us to climb Mt Larrabee (7,861’) on Sunday July 25th. Brief PlanOur plan was to meet Saturday evening at the Yellow Aster Butte Trailhead. This is found just off of the Mt Baker Highway 542. Even though Gimpilator’s Suzuki Bandit has 1,200cc of muscle, it wouldn’t be a good match for the rugged road that climbs up to Twin Lakes at (5,200’). So I planned to taxi him up the last couple miles. We planned to bivy at the lakes for the night and hit the trail early Sunday morning for the southwest gully ascent to Mt Larrabee. A possible Winchester Mountain (6,521’) summit was thrown into the plans for an added bonus. Rugged, Red Larrabee has been on Gimpilator’s list of summits to climb for some time now. His passion for this summit has been alive far beyond our time knowing each other. I could hear the stoke in his voice just talking about this state border massive. Our Objective, Mt Larrabee. Photo Taken By Gimpilator in 2008. Day 1I headed up the Twin Lakes road and meet Gimplilator around 7:30pm. He parked his bike just below the Y.A.B.T.H. and piled his sweaty gear in my lifted truck. He had just spent the last night on Exelsior Peak (5,712’) and then battled the sketchy summit block of Church Mountain (6,315’) that afternoon. He had already made good use of the weekend so far and had stories to tell. We followed the steep road switch backing tightly until we reached the lakes. The lakes were snowed in, so we drove about 30’ onto the snow until finding a great parking spot. It was about 8pm now and Gimp looked over to me and said, “Let’s head up Winchester Mountain real quick so we can check out our route on Larrabee for tomorrow.” I wasn’t sure if he was serious at first, but after seeing the mountain man in his eyes I said, “Should I take my crampons?” We hoped out, threw on some gear and headed up. Gimpilator looking up. Mt Baker on the horizon We made great time until we hit some super steep snow traverses on pretty solid snow. Gimp kicked in some quick steps and I followed right behind. Steep snow and nice colors It was amazing how quickly the views grew with such little effort. Looking South Gimpilator First Glance Looking North The Route Tomyhoi Mt Baker Goat and Shuksan Evening Light Mt Baker Beautiful Evening We were trying to catch the sunset, but it started to happen before we reached the summit. The steep snow really slowed us down as we made sure to get good purchase with our axes. After a couple small snowfields we soon were to a large moat on steep snow, with a rocky ridge above. We navigated this by dropping into its firm belly while straddling snow and rock. We did this for about 30’until Gimp found a line to climb up the rock to gain the ridge. That was pretty much the crux of the whole evening’s shindig. We crossed another snowfield and by this time the sun had set for the evening. Its light was replaced with a glorious full moon and rich colors still lingering around. It was a breathtaking affair. We finally got to the lookout around 9:30pm or so. Me enjoying the last moments of light on Winchester Gimpilator enjoying the moonlight views from on top. There was still sufficient light from the evening colors and full moon to enjoy killer views. After taking it all in, we headed back down to camp. If there wasn’t such steep snow, you could almost go down under the luminosity of the moon. Oh, the crux again was the gnarly moat, now in the murky light. Gimpilator showing this Moat who's boss at night. We got back to camp around 10:30pm. That NightI decided to sleep in my bag in the bed of my truck. I gave Gimpilator the offer to bivy on the bed of my truck, but he choose the snowfield instead. I guess he was too hot the night before on Exelsior, so he had a different plan by cooling off in the snow. We got our packs ready for the morning and Gimp hit the sack. I cooked some late dinner because I hadn't eaten yet. Soon, I too was clocked out for the night. The moon was high, which lighted up the whole twin lakes basin. It almost felt like taking a nap during the day, without the sunscreen or lawn chair of course. I tried to position my face, so the moon light didn't keep me awake. 2:30AM. This time came quick with the sound of a truck pulling into camp. Not only did it pull into camp, but it started to back up a snow covered hill punching the gas. They worked on spinning tires at a high rpm for a couple minutes as I sat up in my sleeping bag watching them. They then parked the rig and it just sat for awhile. Kind of hard to sleep after that!!! I laid back down and just listened. Eventually I heard them get out and walk down to the lake. They passed within feet of my truck on the crunchy snow. I was so tempted to look up and get a view of who they were. All of a sudden, “BOOM... BOOM...BOOM!!!” SHOTS FIRED. The echoing sound in the still of the night was overwhelming. I felt like we were in a wild west movie. I reached for my knife and then remembered the old saying, “Don’t bring a knife to a gun fight.” I barely peaked above the bed of my truck, but couldn’t see the shooter. I looked over about a 100’ where Gimp was sleeping; his head was popped up looking around. I sunk down in my bag and just listened. Two more shots fired and then it was silent. I never slept well for the rest of the night. In the morning, there was no sign of these rabble rousers. Only memories of their voices and the loud echoes of their gun. Day 2 First light looking toward Pocket Peak and the Skagway Pass Gimpilator and I ready to head up. We got up at 6:30am and headed down the trail a bit after 7. We cut between the lakes and headed up the Winchester Route. Soon we were to the junction to high pass. We hung a right there and trotted along. We came around the corner and saw our first views of Mt Larrabee and The Pleiades. The Route Starting Out First Glimpse Our Destination Large Headwall Scree Basin Pano Snow on High Pass We traversed a couple snow fields and noticed that someone had been up there within the last couple days. We studied our route as we went. Getting to High Pass we lost some elevation until we were just below Low Pass. This is where it switchbacks up to about 5,600’ at Low Pass. There was a large snow headwall that ran about 100’. We stayed to the right of this and made our way to High Pass(6,000'). Here we ran into two ladies who camped that night. Their destination was High Pass and told us a group of 7 climbers summited Larrabee the day before. The Route We took Looking South From Above High Pass We continued and dropped into the large snow filled bowl. Later in the summer this is filled with nasty scree and talus. We lucked out and traversed the great snow until it was a vertical snow climb for a couple hundred feet. The top had a rim, which we were careful to climb out of. Gimplilator on the edge. Coming up out of the scree basin full of snow Once on this ridge high above the snow filled bowl we got to our first decision. There were two immediate gully options. One to the left which looked narrow and solid. The one to the right was wider, but very loose rock. We choose the gully to the left. Gimpilator in the beginning of the chimney section We could only see maybe 75’ up each gully, so we went off of the rock conditions we could see. They both went in the direction to the summit. The gully to the left went good for awhile. Soon we became pretty exposed on a solid class 3 scramble. The rock turned into very loose and unstable garbage. Large rocks that appeared to be solid, would pull out very easily. This brought on danger for the climber below and obviously the climber pulling himself up. We took our time to navigate the rocks and found some decent lines here and there. We got to one section that was sketchy, exposed and required a very physical and mental move. Gimp was ahead of me and he cliffed out to the left. I tried this sketchy move to the right, knowing that right above it was better ground. I made the move and Gimp followed. Gimpilator finally out of the narrow, steep chimney section Once we were above, we decided this is not were we would be descending down. The rest of the climb was on very loose red rocks. It sounded like broken glass. Me showing off the exposure on Larrabee Then it was back on the nasty rock. This mountain is extremely dangerous if there are climbers above you. It does not matter how careful you are, large rocks will fall down. I would not attempt this without a helmet, and I would be very questionable to be far below another climbing party. Soon we found a faint boot path. The only reason we found this was a couple cairns that had been built along the way. We followed this faint path, more like some dust on the rocks. One bonus in all the crummy rock, was the beautiful flowers everywhere. Pink at 7,400' with Mt Baker on the horizon. Flower Garden in The Rocks Mt Larrabee Summit (7,861') Gimpilator scrambling to the Summit Soon we could taste the summit. We became really excited for all the work that went into the climb. It was just before noon when we made it to the top. Gimpilator on the East Summit of Mt Larrabee. West Summit and ABP Gimpilator's Summit Pano There is an east and west summit. The east summit is maybe 2 feet higher and is more flat. This is where we had lunch. Both summit have different views. Wow, and the views were crazy. It was amazing to be standing at the very end of the Cascade Mountain Range. You could see the Fraser River Valley separating the ranges. Views into Canada were great, along with the views into the North Cascades. Gimp And I West Summit ABP Illusion Peaks On Top Tomyhoi Lake Slesse Mountain Slesse Glacier The Pleiades Looking north we noticed the large Glacier field a couple thousand feet below. Northside Glacier Everywhere we looked offered bigtime views. We took a short break here and headed down. Heading Down Gimpilator ready to head down. Feeling so small, while God seems so Big We followed the boot path along a ridge. This worked pretty well. The rock was still very unstable. We created many small rock slides going down, trying to be super careful. As we headed down, we found the gully we didn’t take on the way up. We tried this one out, and it was much safer. Gimpilator down climbing. Loose Rock Grey Veins Better Rock Downclimb Shuksan/Baker It still was a solid class 3 downclimb in spots, but a lot safer for us. If you’re into rock climbing, the other gully would be for you. We made good time down. We got to the rim of the snow filled bowl and carefully climbed into it. Gimpilator down climbing into the steep snow Basin Then we did a slow glissade into the snow bowl making sure to stay away from moats and exposed rocks. The rest of the way was a pretty simple hike on a very hot summer day. Heading Home After Great Success Awesome looking Pocket Peak (7,056) high above the Silesia Valley. Gimpilator kept talking about this buffet in Bellingham. So the plan was for me to follow him into Bellingham and eat at this famous hole in the wall. Following Gimpilator to a great buffet after a long climb. Boy did it taste good after a great climb. Thanks Gimp for having me along. I can’t wait for what’s next.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/kautz-epic/818575,Kautz Epic,2012-09-30,"PrologueWith Ryan just recovering from surgery, and myself getting the beginnings of a bad flu, we logically decided the time was right for a mid-technical route on Rainier. That was how our Kautz attempt began, it ended with a 21 hour summit day that left both of us on the brink of collapse and most of my gear covered with snot, phlegm, blood, and grit. This was actually my second attempt on the route, the first being in July of this year, when we turned around just below the ice chute. Reports of high winds near the summit, a slab building up in the chute itself, and our leader’s nervousness about descending the ice pitches, conspired to turn our climb into a reconnaissance effort. For which it actually served quite well, as a knowledge of the route up to that point proved very helpful. Our plan remained basically the same as in July - set a base camp near Hazard and then climb to the summit and descend via the Disappointment Cleaver route, but what we did not know was this: http://mountrainierconditions.blogspot.com/2012/04/disappointment-cleaver-2012.html IMG effectively closed off the route just hours before we were to descend it. Additional photos can be found Here The Approach Day 1: Paradise the Lower Wilson Our plan was for a two and a half day climb, on Friday afternoon we would drive down to Paradise and try to get across the Nisqually, then on Saturday we would hike up to Camp Hazard and on Sunday we would make our summit attempt. Earlier in the year one can hike as far as the shiv before dropping down onto the Nisqually but to avoid the heavily crevassed areas we only went as far as Glacier Vista before descending steeply to the glacier. Some maneuvering was necessary to get around the crevasses but nothing too circuitous. On our map the route to the Wilson was marked to the left (west) of the waterfall, and a group we met descending said something about a gully, but unless this was in reference to the large scree valley east of the cliff band we couldn’t find anything viable and instead went up the scree and black ice slopes (a moderate snow climb in July) to the lower Wilson plateau, where we camped for the night. Shortly after we arrived we realized how dangerous our route had been, as we saw massive rock and ice fall (chunks the size of mobile homes) channeled through the gully we had just climbed up. Although convenient because of how safe it made our camp site, it was the first in a series of realizations that turning around was not a viable option. Day 2: Lower Wilson to Camp Hazard From our camp on the lower Wilson we got a late start and ascended to the top of the Turtle ice-field by mid-afternoon. Until about noon mist frequently obscured our views but the route was direct enough that it was not really a problem. Knowing that we had more than enough daylight to reach our high camp, we killed some time top-roping crevasse walls on the upper part of the Wilson. Although fun, it was not exactly ice climbing as about half of each pitch consisted of a heavy, wet snow that made pick placements release unexpectedly. The Turtle was, as we then considered it, heavily sun-cupped and progress was frustratingly slow, leading us to select one of the first campsites at its peak, at around 10,000 feet. By this time we were above the mist layers but a strong wind had picked up, with gusts strong enough to blow one off balance. After setting up the tent we decided take as much of our gear as possible up the rock step, both to check out the route and to save us time and effort the next day. About forty-five minutes and some aimless wandering brought us to the rappel point, where we found a fixed line that seemed to be in satisfactory shape and a crevice where we could stash our rope, harnesses, crampons, ice-tools, and screws. The wind by this time had become truly awful and we descended quickly hoping the gusts had not been as strong at our camp. Whether they were or not we’ll never know, but at soon as we caught sight of the tent we knew something was deeply wrong; at first it seemed to have partially blown over but then we realized that it was about a hundred feet from where we had set it up, right on the edge of where the Wapowety Cleaver drops down onto the lower Kautz. Inside it was our sleeping bags, pads, and most of our extra clothing and only that weight must have kept it from sailing out over the cliff. Bearing in mind that all four corners and two guy-lines had been secured with rocks before, we only left camp one at a time from that point on. The near-disaster with the tent put both of us on edge, so we decided to simply melt the water we would need for our summit push and then go to bed. About nine or so the wind died down and we managed to get a few hours of sleep. The Climb With some idea of what was ahead of us, we woke at 12:45 and were moving toward the rock step by 1:30. The wind had not started up again and the night felt strangely warm, in addition to being brightly lit by the nearly full moon. After rappelling down the fixed lines we encountered the first sketchy shit-show of the day: the chutes on either side of the main Kautz ice-chute end at headwalls, which means that, unlike the Kautz ice-chute, they regularly send down debris. The point of leaving at mid-night was to avoid this sort of objective danger but as the night was so warm there was little we could have done. A couple minutes before we cross the section we witnessed a small volley of perhaps PC-sized ice chunks come down. All we could do was observe how broken the grown was and deduce that it would not be too difficult to dive for cover if we heard anything, hope a major ice avalanche did not occur, and get across quickly, which we managed without incident. The lower slopes of the Kautz consisted mostly of deep steps, shot flat stretches ending in six to seven foot walls. This ground was not easy to move through quickly, but also not very exposed, so we simply set a running belay. Once we got the ice-chute proper we transitioned to a traditional belay with 2-3 point equalized anchor belay points and progressive protection as we ascended. I was feeling like total and complete shit so Ryan took the first lead and quickly ran out our 40 meter rope. Following was not technically difficult (maybe a WI2 with a layer of frozen mud) but strenuous, especially on the calves. Pick placements nearly always sounded hollow and getting one I was actually confident of took 4-5 swings in most places, yet the slope was moderate enough that for long stretches I didn’t bother too much with it and just trusted my feet. Feeling like we were in too deep to complain, I took the second lead and ended up about 10 feet short of an excellent natural shelf, leaving me with a hanging belay. Ryan led another pitch and then during my second lead we toped out of the ice chute and the slope angle dropped to where we only needed a running belay. First light was around this time. From the top of the ice chute to the summit was a long traverse around the upper slopes of the Kautz, Nisqually, and Ingraham glaciers, as we attempted, in vain it often seemed, to find our way through the maze of crevasses; I do not exaggerate when I say that what we saw there was about two-dozen of the largest, scariest, most beautifully menacing crevasses I have ever seen, dwarfing anything in the North Cascades. Eventually we met the beaten path of the DC route about 100 feet short of the crater rim and finally summited at 11:45. I probably would have been content to sit in a wind-sheltered spot for a few more minutes but Ryan, this being his first summit of Rainier, was intent on reaching the true high-point at Colombia Crest, so we made our way across the crater and up to the windblown summit itself. The DescentThe route down the mountain appeared to be a veritable road, so we set out confident that we would be in Camp Muir before long and back to Paradise at a reasonable time. Despite our state of exhaustion, the summit push had taken more than ten hours, we proceeded at a decent pace until the track disappeared in a patch of ice. We followed a series of broken flags down for a few hundred more feet, but by this time we could look across and up at the Disappointment Cleaver and we couldn’t seem to find any way across down the cliff to the faint tracks that led back up. Based on our limited knowledge of the route, it was clear that we were much too far north (Camp Schurman would have been a more direct shot than Muir), but as we had come from the south-west there was no way we had been on the wrong route from the beginning. This left us with two options, the first was to descend farther and hope we picked up the route again, the second was to go back up and hope we missed a fork in the trail. I was very confident that I had not missed a junction, so we descended for a few more minutes before it became increasingly clear that there was not a way down and south to the DC. This left us with only one option - re-climb the route and hope we had missed something, meanwhile knowing that if we had not our only choice would be to descend the Kautz, bivouac somewhere along the way, and likely have the park service out looking for us on Monday. Luckily, we found a faint side-trail (really just a trench) at around 13,400 ft that contained a scattered collection of flags. The footpath had clearly gone off to the left, which is why I had not really noted it as a junction, but it was in the correct position for a straight shot down to the DC. Predictably, the not-track disappeared fairly quickly, but by this time we were desperate and willing to force the route. In other conditions this would have involved a rappel or two but with the slopes so heavily sun-cupped it was simple enough down climbing we didn’t even need to set a running belay and soon, much to our relief, we found ourselves at the top of the DC with a clear track down. The true difficulties were over. The route wandered over the DC and we followed it roughly, snow and scree and crampon scraped rock. Crossing the Ingraham we had to get creative again but we always re-met the defined route after each detour (it seems likely that these were the areas where the guide services use a ladder). Just as darkness was catching us we arrived at Camp Muir and, for the first time in 16 hours, took off our crampons. Running on sheer adrenaline, I was so drained that whenever I stopped for more than a minute or two I started shaking uncontrollably, despite it not being very cold. The muir snowfield has never felt so long, or the trails to the parking lot so aimless or wandering. There was a point where we realized that we not on the trail we had used coming up, but observing that this is probably the only place on earth where all roads lead to paradise, we didn’t worry about it too much and finally hiked at around 10:30 pm, 21 hours after we left our camp that morning. EvaluationIt now seems clear what happened: the IMG group cleaned the route behind them, removing fixed lines and ladders, this explains why our route, so clear on minute, seemed to disappear into thin air. Had we spoken to climbing rangers on Friday when we got our permits this might have been avoided but this time of year that ranger station is only open on weekends. This route proved to be the most serious, strenuous, committing climb either Ryan or myself had done. Although generally not considered a highly technical route, with both the glacier and ourselves in decidedly bad condition, it was a real challenge. Sometimes in the winter and spring, clad in fresh snow, Rainier can appear luminous. Glowing magnificently in the moonlight, the very air sparkling in the afternoon sun. But by autumn the pretty sheath has melted and away and we see the mountain’s true nature. Driving away, looking back at the mountain, Ryan and I agreed she looked positively murderous. Hail Talol, mother of snows; and hail the jewel of the lotus flower.

single-day,https://www.summitpost.org/dragontail-says-welcome-back-to-the-bulgers/806263,Dragontail Says Welcome Back to the Bulgers,2012-08-09,"Introduction: The Bulger DroughtBack in series between 2008 to mid-2010 I was on a real role with mountaineering. Volcanoes used to go now like nothing and big two day trip used to come to me with ease. Nothing was perfect but it had seemed that I finally found my groove in the mountaineering field. The biggest thing was that weight which was always a struggle was down to the lowest it had been since the age of 12 and the body fat ratio was at 5%. Once I got to these goals I started to Washington’s top one hundred, i.e. the Bulger List. Then life got the better of me. The Goal! A loss of car, loss of a job then a grueling two- job 85 hour a week schedule severely cut into those at one time limitless plans. Starting mid 2010 all the way until this last Thursday I went into a Bulger List Drought. Though I climbed well over 100 mountains of varying difficulties not one of them were on the Washington State Bulger List. Dragontail was on many hiking plans over these past two years but due to partner concerns condition concern, timing and a number of other issues it did not happen. The two-job schedule did not produce much in the financial results. Gas and fast food ate half of the money and in two years despite being heavily active in hiking and climbing much of my old weight came back. Heading Up Well finally everything finally opened it door for me on this past Thursday and it was time for me to break this miserable, horrible drought. I finally was able to combine with Jimbopo and tag this beautiful mountain. We woke up early in the pre-dawn hours and then got to the trailhead for morning start. The first round of hiking to Colchuck Lake was not very hard and luckily the heat of the day had not hit this section yet. The weather looked good and we were making good time up the trail. Both Jimbopo and I were feeling quiet confident about our chances of making the summit. First Good View! But once we got across Colchuck Lake reality came crashing in. The backside of Colchuck Lake was more of a cairn boulder scramble than a nice trail. Then came the real gut check Aasgard Pass. This 2300 feet in .75 mile cairned scramble was torture to my now heavier body. I was really feeling it from the hot sun and my energy tank was ringing on empty. At one point I was thinking about turning around due to a number of issues. Thankful Jimbopo talked me out of such crazy talk and after lunch up at Aasgard Pass we decided to head up to Dragontail via the Snow Creek Glacier Route. Mountain Goat In the Pass! Route Up to Dragontail! Other Peaks for the Future! The 35-40 degree snow-climb was even more effort. But if there is one thing most people know about me is the fact that I love a good snow-climb. This particular snow climb required crampons which I remember to bring for the trip. Both Jimbopo and I took this climb up slowly to the top of the ridge. Once on the top of ridge we saw the obvious climbers trail up to the summit. This was basically was a walkup with a little Class 2 at the very, very top. The last little bit was actually easier than the heading up to Aasgard Pass. Once we got to final summit area we scrambled up to the very true summit where an incredible view awaited us. Mellow finally to the exposed summit! The Summit Colchuck Lake (shot by Jimbopo using my camera) It might have been a mellow last little bit to the true summit of Dragontail but the true summit is highly exposed, with Colchuck Lake literally 3400 feet straight below. I was able to manage a couple of shots on the true summit and I gave the camera to Jimbopo to finish the rest. The view was amazing but I was getting very dizzy and feeling a little unstable on the true summit so after 30 seconds I headed over to the next rock. Jimbopo spent some more time on the true summit while I got some of my energy left. After being on the summit rocks for a while we scrambled back to a small resting area to refuel before heading down the mountain. Rainier (shot by Jimbopo with my camera) The rocky peaks of Dragontail(shot by Jimbopo with my camera) Isolation Lake and other Enchantments Colchuck Lake! Heading Down Last look at the route to Dragontail as we are heading down. On the way down we decided to take a slow glissade down the mountain. Any speed here might have gotten us in a lot of trouble due to the hardness of the snow. Despite the slow and controlled glissade we made it back to Aasgard Pass in twenty minutes. There we refueled for what was going to be a long descend down the steep and very rock Aasgard Pass. This path down was brutal not because it was steep but because there was no footing all the way down it to Colchuck Lake. It took us an hour and a half just to get down this brutal path-scramble. At this point we noticed the sun beginning to go down and knew we were running out of sunlight. Last look at the route to Resting on Aasgard Dragontail in the evening sun The scramble around the back of Colchuck Lake took whatever energy we had and ate it out alive. All I could think at this time was ouch. We took another small break at Colchuck Lake and then headed back. At this point we were continuing to race time despite our tired bodies demanding rest; we pushed past Colchuck Lake and then continued down to the Stewart Lake trail. Last shot of the beast!! Just before the Stewart Lake Trail, the darkness of night finally caught us. We had about 3 miles left now all in headlamps. This seems easy but is the furthest thing from it. We both now were extremely tired and only I had an extra set of batteries. The only thing I could think about was the relief of sitting in my car when we got back and the blanket I packed in there. My dirty sweaty body was in pain for every up and down we went through, but we stayed calm and rode the trail all the way to the parking lot. The ConclusionOnce we got back to the car we realized it was past 11 pm and there was nothing open in Leavenworth. Both of us were too tired to drive home and so we made a decision to sleep at the trailhead. Once there we were approached by a couple who did the Enchantments loop only to realize that they left one of their keys somewhere in the Enchantments. They were set to sleep for the night so we told them we would take them down in the early morning. We managed a couple hours of sleep and a good amount of body rest and at sunrise we were ready to head back. We dropped the couple back at the car and then headed on back home, tired but happy because for me THE BULGER DROUGHT IS OVER!!!! I really need to thank Jimbopo on this one. He helped with the driving and the motivation on the trail. On the times when it was hurting the most he was there. I know that I had the right partner on this trip. As for me this trip was a wake-up call for me to challenge myself to more Bulgers and get myself back into the shape that led me to the success I had in 2009 and 2010. Hopefully this is the beginning of another round of great climbs for me. And moreover hopefully I will continue to tackle the Bulger List in the upcoming two months. Let this be the beginning of something.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/mt-olympus-in-3-parts/323445,Mt Olympus - In 3 Parts,1999-11-30,"Climbing Mt. Olympus - 1 Four Part Series - Part 1 The Olympics The Olympic Range lies a scant 30 miles from Seattle on the Olympic Peninsula, a huge national park that is 95% wilderness and through which no road passes. In the spring when the sky is clear the gleaming white peaks of its mountains can be seen across the sound. However even in today's modern era of rapid transportation getting to them is an undertaking in time, and thats just to the east side that faces Seattle. I once did a thru hike in the Olympics and making our drop off point and transferring to our start took 6 hours from Seattle, 3 hours of which involved me huddled in my sleeping bag in the back of a Toyota pickup. Mt Olympus at 7969 feet is the highest mountain in the range and is on the western side of the Olympic Peninsula, accessed up long and deep rain forest valleys, our destination to climb. Despite its relatively short height, the prominence of its peaks traps moisture blowing off the pacific and it is heavily glaciated at a much lower elevation than the Cascades that sit east of Seattle. Imagine now how inaccessible the mountains must have seemed to the first settlers of the Puget Sound. The interior of the peninsula remained largely un-penetrated and in the modern age called out to be conquered, to be explored and made known. The Seattle Press, partially as a marketing feat to sell papers, sponsored what became known as the Press Expedition. They started at the northern edge of the peninsula and made their way up the Elhwa River, starting in 1889 (Feb/March) pulling canoes up snow swollen river banks, transferring several loads of 50 lb of gear that included iron dutch ovens. Eventually over 50 miles and 5 months later they emerged at Lake Quinault having traversed the interior and made their way across the range. Mt. Olympus remained unclimbed, at least according to the way modern man tracks and records events. In early 1900s mountaineering groups were popular, The Alpine Club of London, the Sierra Club in California by John Muir and associates, gradually it become more known for its political environmentalism than its outings, the Mazamas out of Portland and The Mountaineers based in Seattle founded by Ashael Curtis and Henry Landes. They set out for their first expedition to climb Mt. Olympus in 1907, during which 65 members made a group climb. Signing up and PreparingWhen I saw the advertisement in Backpacker Magazine for Summit for Someone the combination of an opportunity for a guided climb of a mountain and the chance to help out inner city kids get into the outdoors was an instant appeal. My first thought was honestly to sign up for Rainier, however by the time I attempted registering on the Summit for Someone site Rainier trips were full and so I signed up for Olympus. Then began the work of raising funds to meet the pledge goal, and thanks to the generous contributions of many people I was quickly able to meet that. Finally the long wait through the winter for the gear to arrive and then the training to gain experience and be in shape : Guye Peak, Mt. Adams and lots and lots of hiking like Timpanogos. Then came July, which is when the rain is typically supposed to stop in Seattle, but not this July. We had rain, lots of it. Gray skies and thunderclouds. As we got within two weeks of the climb, the mostly cloudy and showers forecasts were not looking too good. The week before the climb it was pouring rain in the Olympics, but the forecast showed clearing on our days. I talked to Craig Von Hoy (our guide) on the weekend before we went and he told tales of buckets of rain for the prior group and they turned around on the glacier and didn't even attempt the summit because it was raining so hard. I packed everything up and prayed for sunshine. :) Day 1 (and a half) We had to be to Hoh Visitor Center by 10 am on Thursday. Since its a 5 hour drive for me, and even more for Seth, we decided to leave on Wednesday evening. I drove out to Olympia and met Seth and Jeff Roberts, who had drove up from Portland. They grabbed a bite to eat at the 2 Mile House Pub and Eatery, and then we dropped off my car at the Mormon church on Overhulse road and started the long drive in the mini-van for the coast. Around midnight we were getting tired and we stopped in Aberdeen, a logging town where Kurt Cobain grew up and which now has the phrase Come as You Are beneath there city sign. We grabbed a room at Aberdeen's Finest Olympic Inn, which for a Wednesday night was 2 rooms shy of being full up and the clerk had no idea why. I crashed on the floor while Seth and Jeff took a bed and we woke at 6 the next morning to get started. We stopped at Denny's for some grub (actually not too bad, despite my vow to never return) and then headed for Humptulips and beyond. We were still a bit early and so we stopped off at Ruby Beach for quick stroll. We pulled up at the Hoh Visitor Center parking lot at 9:55 am right on time. The trip was guided by Craig Von Hoy's Go Trek & Expeditions. Craig has over 30 years experience guiding, has summited Rainier 357 times, and Olympus over 40. He knows how to climb Olympus and given the super long approach (over 18 miles) a key to this is pack animals. Craig hired a pack team, Glenn and Al, and their 6 mules to haul our gear the first 15 miles to Elk Lake. So after the rest of the crew pulled up and we did introductions all around, for the next two hours we sorted gear, moving all the heavy stuff to the mantie's for the mules and helping organize the group gear. At noon, one climber (Nathaniel Cogdil) hadn't shown up (we found out later he broke his foot) and we paused for the requisite before group photo and then headed off down the trail for Lewis Meadows 10.5 miles away. The Hoh River runs 50 miles from the Hoh Glacier on the east side of Mt Olympus, over the eons the Hoh River has cut a deep valley with a meandering floor in which 240 inches of rain falls annually and the world's largest temperate rain forest grows. The mild climate combined with rain leads to massive growth, both in terms of the amount of biomass produced and as huge trees. The trail parallels the river and meanders through a verdant green landscape that overwhelms with life. After a short break at Happpy 4 Shelter, we arrived at Lewis Meadows around 4 pm. The mules had already arrived and we promptly set up a luxuriuos camp for backpacking and then headed down to the river to rest, relax and refill our water bottles. I was hot and tired and took a dip in the river to clean up, the water was freezing (as it came from glacier melt) but was refreshing in a chilly sort of way non-the-less. Jeff was bushed and found a nice place to take a quiet nap. After waking him we made our way back to camp to for an amazing salmon burrito dinner and then a round table dinner discussion where we did lengthier introductions and went over the itinerary. Bushed and tired from a long day on the trail we went to sleep in preparation for the long day tomorrow hiking up to high camp on the glacier. Stats : 10.5 miles - 840ft asc - 370 dec - 5 hr, 7 min Set on www.flickr.com Climbing Mt. Olympus - 2 Four Part Series - Part 2 Day 2Our day began with a 6 am wakeup call from Craig, we woke and had an awesome set of breakfast burritos. We broke down camp and separated out the heavy gear we'd need for high camp, all of the large tents, chairs and large gear stayed at Lewis Meadows. The mules once again carried the gear, this time though they would only accompany us half way up to Elk Lake, beyond Elk Lake the trail gets narrow and mules can't pass. The section of the trail just east of Lewis Meadows continues with the series of huge trees, these are quickly left behind as the trail begins to climb towards Elk Lake. Just prior to the lake the trail turns south and crosses the Hoh River, which at this point cuts a deep narrow gorge through the rock. The High Hoh bridge crosses this 140+ foot chasm. At Elk Lake we rested in the trees above the lake (we never ventured down to the lake itself) for a bit waiting for Glenn, Al and the mules to catch us. Who should come walking down the trail but one of my Flickr contacts, Chris : cpkpdx, we'd run across each other posting photos of mountaineering. We'd discovered we were both going to be heading up to Olympus around the same time, he'd be coming out at around the time I was going up. It was great meeting him in person, glad to hear he'd summited and I felt bad he had a 15 mile full pack journey ahead of him back to the car. After Chris left the mules arrived and we crammed our packs full of gear and started the 5 mile hike up to Glacier Meadows. The trail wound its way through some avalanche chutes where the trail got very narrow. As we came up the trail to a bend around one of the rocky chutes a mountain goat was waiting for us. He let me walk within 5 feet of him before he scrambled up the hillside a bit and we passed by. By this point, one of our guides, Meaghan turned back as she had been throwing up several times and was feeling quite ill. Soon we arrived at Glacier Meadows which had a yurt for the rangers and we stopped for a bit of rest and some water. Loading up we left the trees behind as we began to hike into the high meadow and alpine zone where the grass was green and the flowers were out. We followed a small creek up a drainage toward the top of the ridge. Along this section of the trail I was bonking pretty hard, it was hot, I was tired and I hadn't eaten enough. I had packed too light on food, opting to leave too much of my lunch snacks behind at Lewis Meadows. I slowed down a bit and walked towards the back of the pack with Craig. At last we arrived at the top of the ridge which was the top of a huge moraine that overlooked the blue glacier below and Mt. Olympus and the snow dome rising up above us. It was an overwhelming glorious sight. For the entire 18 mile approach you don't really ever get any good views of the mountain until the very end and you come up over the ridge and then everything is in view. We all sat down and gazed at the spectacle before us. Everyone pulled out their cameras, they way you always do the first time you see a spectacular scene. We changed into long pants out of shorts, put on gaiters and a long sleeve shirt and made our way down the moraine across the snow field to the edge of the blue glacier. Here we stopped and put on our harness, crampons and light gloves and split into two rope teams. Alaina, myself, Seth and Jeff on one rope and Craig, Sue, Steve, Karl and Jim. We'd maintain these positions for the next 24 hours through the next day. Off we set across the glacier, you can follow our route on this google map. Its an amazing landscape where ancient blue ice crunches beneath your crampons, interspersed with snow. I took a shot with the camera and Alaina snapped at me to stop taking photos and concentrate on walking where she walked. I asked her to explain her thought process as we crossed. She explained how snow could be covering crevasses, and that old ice was the safest. Another thing we had to watch out for was melting holes in the ice and snow that could appear shallow or firm but be an icy dip. She also explained how crevasses form, in glacier fields the convex surface cracks and splits, on snow fields higher up the same convex surface does the same but with height playing factors as snow lower down pulls away from snow higher up. The majority of the crevasses we walked around or crossed were very small, maybe 6 inches wide. There were some larger ones but we avoided those, most of the really big crevasses were higher up on the snow fields. Once safely across the glacier we stopped for a break and removed the ropes and crampons and refilled our water. We stared in awe at the gnarled ice fields above the glacier. A maw of cracks they were beautiful to behold. We then turned right or north and started climbing the snow ridge and rocks towards our high camp. A short while later as the long sun shone we pulled into camp just before 5 pm, 11 hours on the trail, 9.2 miles and 5340 feet since Lewis Meadows. Seth, Jeff and myself opted to camp on the snow and cleared a flat place to pitch our tent. While Craig and Alaina cooked up some dinner, I tried to get a good close up photo of everyone in the group, but I missed Jim who was lying down resting. Diner was ramen, that cheap kind you haven't eaten since college, but it tasted so very very good. I had a steaming overflowing cup and two chocolate puddings. By this time Sue was exhausted, I think maybe more mentally than physically and she decided she'd not be accompanying us on the summit attempt the following morning. Craig gave us a few minutes rest and then had everyone meet Alaina on the snow above camp and she went over self arrest with an ice ax in the event of a fall and Sue took a photo or two for me with my camera. Then a quick flurry of last minute packing and arranging for the early morning summit day, and we lay down in our tents. It was 8pm and within seconds we were all asleep, tired again from a long day and attempting to get in as much sleep before the 1 am wake up call. Stats : 9.2 miles - 5340ft asc - 350 dec - 11 hr Set on www.flickr.com Climbing Mt. Olympus - 3 Four Part Series - Part 3 Day 3 - Summit DayAt 1:10 am Craig's voice boomed across the snow : ""Time to wake up guys"". The thump of adrenalin hits your veins in anticipation; throw on the contacts, clothes, harness, boots, helmet, gaiters and crampons. Stumble outside and behold the mountain all aglow from the moon with high clouds wisping overhead. I packed my mono-pod for summit shots, and crammed it into the snow for a few shots while I ate my 2 packs of oatmeal mixed in with hot-chocolate. The anticipation of the start dulls any sense of sleep or tiredness. We rope up, same order as before : Alaina leading, then me, then Seth and Jeff brings up the rear. Craig starts off first up the snow dome, leading Steve, Karl and Jim and we follow. They take a nice rest step pace : kick front leg and lock, taking off weight from back leg then left back leg and kick. Lather, rinse and repeat. One step at a time make our way up the snow dome. Its not a race and I am not even breathing hard, so trying to be helpful in the dark plodding along I start telling a story from the book Worst Journey in the World about Scott's men camping on the ice with Russian horses and how they woke in the night to the sound of breaking ice and open water and were harried by Killer Whales.... (read the book) and Craig yelled back down : ""Hey guys lets keep quiet and listen to the sound of the morning wind. If you guys have enough air to talk perhaps I am not going fast enough"". In other words shut up. :) I mutter inside my head a bit hurt, but turn my attention back to climbing, which was exactly Craig's point : stay focused on the task at hand. He warned us again to be careful as we came upon our first turn on the slope where we'd have to step across the rope as we changed directions. Seth slipped and his right crampon sliced the gaiter, pant and calf on his left leg. About 3/4 inch wide and deep enough to have some fatty stuff poking out. Alaina pulled out her first aid kit, butterflied it, gauzed it and wrapped it. Seth said it felt fine and we carried on. Late Craig said he was worried he was going to have to send Seth back to camp, I replied that I think you'd have had to saw Seth's foot off to keep him from reaching the summit that day. We carried on up the snow dome and then with the summit directly in front of us which has a huge bergschrund blocking a more direct ascent, so we turned to the left (east) heading for a notch in the Five Finger Ridge. Here we came to a very steep 20 foot slope. Alaina kicked steps up the slope and we all followed. Still pitch black we crossed over a gnarly looking snow bridge across two crevasses and made our way along a snow field leading around the backside of the summit. Karl asked Craig if we were stopping anytime soon as he was having cramps and was going to have to use the bathroom! Uggh, talk about not the time; usually they just furrow out the rope to the end and you have no privacy, but Karl convinced Craig to let him go down the slope a bit, we all turned of our lights for a bit of privacy and waited. Blue bag in hand, Karl said he felt better and we carried on. We stop to remove our crampons and cross a rocky ridge on the backside of the summit, just minor scrambling without any exposure. We've now come full circle to the ridge below, the sky is beginning to lighten as we walk up the windswept and icy bowl of crystal pass that sits between the west peak and a small unnamed rocky peak. Once more on with the crampons we kick up the very steep slope of the last snow field below the haystack of the west peak. Now its a matter of route finding for Craig and Alaina while the rest of the two rope teams sit on the slope and wait. What a fortuitous set of circumstances, as we sit the dawn unfolds before us. The clouds in the sky takes on an intense orange glow silhouetting Mt. Baker and then I yell as the sun cracks over a distant ridge and shines its orange glow across the peaks as we all grin from the sheer joy of being up high with such a beautiful setting. Meanwhile Alaina and Craig have prepared a narrow snow ramp with steep sides onto the haystack. Protection is provided by a couple of picket's along the way. As we cross the bridge, we leave our crampons and ice axes behind on the snow and start the scramble up the haystack. This scramble has a bit more exposure, as we walk along a crack and then climb up a 5.6 chimney which got my blood pounding. Then its a simple matter of scrambling up the ridge line to the summit! The views were astounding as the still early light played off the snowy peaks of nearby Mt. Tom and the north summit. Mt. Adams and Mt. St. Helens lay off on the distance as well. I cram my mono pod in between two large rocks and shimmying it with a small rock and we all pose on the top for the requisite summit photo. We spent 30 minutes on top, admiring the views, taking photos and taking it all in. What a sense of accomplishment, and what a great mountain. Then the reverse begins, we down climb through the chimney and begin our descent. Its interesting to see in the light going down what we'd passed in the dark coming up, large crevasses looked bigger in the light and the snow dome is much better lit up. We made quick time step sliding down to the steep slope of the snow dome above our camp. Along the way I continue to take photos, and Craig took to calling our rope crew the Shutter Bug Team, as Seth has the same photo taking propensity, later this moniker was shortened to the Bug Team and then the B-Team. Arriving at the snow dome, we all really wanted to glissade down, so we traversed over a bit so as to not go sliding into oblivion and then while roped up each team slid down in succession and walked the few feet back to camp. Safe and sound, my body seemed to know that NOW was the time to relieve bodily functions and I became a member of the blue bag club. (Its very important in the high alpine zones to minimize the impact of humans, thus all solid waste has to be bagged and removed) We broke camp, loaded up our packs and started descending through the rock and snow fields to the blue glacier. Traveling back across the blue glacier was very hot, while a cool breeze blew high clouds across the mountains, the sun was still shining and the reflective sun across the ice was sweltering. I was sweating buckets as we made our way back across. With the two days of sun, there was even more water on the glacier and the slushy holes. Sadly our time on the snow and ice came to an end and we made our last bit of elevation gain back up to the top of the moraine where we changed out of long pants and shirts to shorts and sleeves and put all the glacier gear away. The heavy packs slung once more on our backs, we made for Elk Lake where we would reunite with the mules. I have never been more happy to see a 4 legged creature than those mules walking up the trail. Our packs lightened we quickly made the way back over the High Hoh bridge, around the chutes and to Lewis Meadows, 14 hours after starting that morning. Seth, Jeff and I wandered down to the river to wash off. I lay down in the river a couple of times and scrubbed the sweat and grime off. Seth not having a change of clothes stripped and bathed. I tried to convince Steve to get in, goading him about when he'd be back in such a setting, but he just enjoyed laying on the sand bar listening to his i-pod. Dinner that night couldn't come soon enough, we were starving. Finally ready, we piled in for mounds of pasta with cheesy sauce and sausage. Exhausted we trundled off to bed to catch up on sleep. Sadly my sleeping pad had been had been punctured at high camp while packing up and I had a very uncomfortable night ahead of me.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/lessons-learned-on-mt-rainier/900168,Lessons learned on Mt. Rainier,2014-06-02,"First AttemptGrowing up in the Northwest, Rainier has always been looming in the background.  After getting into hiking and snowshoeing, I had my sights set on Rainier.  While moving into my new apartment, I met my landlord Bruce who had summitted Rainier eleven times.  He offered to guide me up to the top. It took me three tries to reach the top, due to weather and lack of preparation.  I learned some valuable lessons along the way.   The first attempt was in April 2013.  We were going to do a practice run up to Muir and back, but the weather looked too clear to not attempt a summit.  The Gib Ledges were in excellent condition, so we decided to go that route.  The only thing that had us worried was the wind, which was saying a possibility of 50mph.   Mt. Rainier from Paradise Looking at Adams from Camp Muir. It was pretty windy down at Paradise around 20-25mph at night, but in the morning the winds calmed.  We made it to Muir in five hours and prepped for an early start at 1am.  By then the winds had picked up significantly to 30+mph.  There were a couple groups at the bunk house, one from the east coast who were made it to summit battling the wind all the way up and back. Taking them 16 hrs. from Muir-Summit and back to Muir.   It was pretty busy up at camp Muir. Mt. Adams, Mt. Hood, Mt. St. Helens and the Tatoosh Range. We went to sleep with the wind beating down on the bunk house.  At 1am the winds were still howling, so we decided to wait for the morning.  In the morning the we attempted to climb the ledges, but the wind was throwing us onto the ground with every 50mph gust.  We made it a couple hundred feet before we decided to head back to Paradise.  Frustrated, I waited eagerly for my next attempt at the mountain. Gibraltar Ledges June 2013, we had a decent weather window for a summit bid via the Gib Ledges.  No crazy winds this time!  I had gotten in a motorcycle accident at 45mph a month before, so I had to rest for a month, which equated to some weight gain.  We attempted to head up on Friday night, but got caught in a downpour.  We headed back down after making it up about 1000 ft. and rested at Paradise.  The next morning was crystal clear.  We made it up to Camp Muir in the evening and slept to head out at 1am.  With the warmer summer weather, I had difficulty sleeping in my 10F bag.  I was either too hot or too cold and had pretty restless sleep.  I was also feeling a little sick from getting soaked the previous night.    Awesome weather conditions! Gibraltar Rock Marmot! We woke up and left around 2am.  We had some navigation issues on the ledges and had to downclimb to get back to the ledges, but we were making great time.  Up towards the top of the ledges there was some sketchy verglas, but I wasn't too much out of my comfort zone.   My climber partner Bruce on the Gib Ledges. Looking out at the hanging glacier. Long ways down. Sunrise on Mt. Adams Looking out at St. Helens past the hanging glacier. At the Gibraltar shoot we decided not to put in protection and to take our time kicking in firm steps.  It varied from 45 to 50+ degree snow slopes.  Bruce was very cautious and took his time while I kept my ice axe firmly planted in the snow in case of a fall.  While waiting I started to get cold since we were still in the shadow of the rock.  I wasn't in a position to put on my down jacket, so I just had to tough it out.  Once we got out of the shoot, I took the lead so I could get some blood flowing in my numb toes.  When we got to the top of Gibraltar rock I was exhausted.  We hadn't had time to stop for food and I had was running on empty.  I put on my down jacket and reached for my powerbar I had kept in my jacket pocket and... it was frozen... Should have kept it in my pants.  I was too tired to boil water for my dehydrated food, so I just slept for 30 minutes to warm up.  We were on a time constraint and had to be back in Seattle by Sunday night.  I had to finish grading papers the following day.  So we kept pushing, while I had only breakfast in me. Taking a nap break at the top of Gibraltar rock. The endless snowfield. Looking out at Mt. Adams Bruce was slowing down as well.  At 13,500 I calculated our pace and realized we were only going about 300-400 ft. per hour!  It would take another 3 hours to reach the summit at that rate and I was falling asleep from lack of energy, so I convinced Bruce for us to descend and try again another time.  He took a little while to convince, haha.  While heading down the DC route, I was almost sleepwalking.  Pretty scary.  We stopped at the top of the cleaver and I asked Bruce for some of his nuts and jerky.  Should have brought food that wouldn't freeze...  We made it safely down the cleaver, but I was having trouble staying awake the entire time.  We took a nap at the Muir bunk house and headed home in the evening.  I had caught a cold and was sick for two weeks afterwards.  I had vowed to never attempt the summit again, but after a few days climber's amnesia set in.  I thought about all the mistakes I had made and decided to try again the following year with better training and proper food. Third time's a charm We were hoping to climb on memorial day weekend this year, but after the last two times I wanted to have a really good window before I headed to Paradise.  The following week was excellent conditions, so Bruce and I got packed for the 2nd of June.  I had been biking to work 50+ miles a week, so I felt more than ready for the summit bid.  We left Seattle at 5am and headed to Rainier. Heading up to Camp Muir. Cathedral Gap from Camp Muir. Bruce at the Muir Bunk house. There was a chance of Thunderstorms in the evening, but luckily they passed by Rainier.  We made it up to Muir in 5 and a half hours.  A little longer since we were carrying an extra day's food.  The was a lot of helicopter activity at camp Muir.  RMI was bringing up this year's supplies.  We ate our dinner and headed out at 8pm.  Our plan was to bivy at the top of the cleaver and spend the second night at the summit.   Helicopter dropping supplies for RMI. On the Cowlitz glacier. Looking back at Camp Muir. The conditions were perfect.  No wind and incredible views!  We were welcomed by an beautiful sunset above the Cathedral Gap. Little Tahoma and the Emmons glacier. Thunderclouds and the Emmons glacier. Sunset on Mt. St. Helens Thunderclouds at the top of the Cathedral Gap. Sunset over the Emmons Glacier. We pushed on through Ingraham flats and up the cleaver.  Part way up the cleaver my crampons started to fall off.  I put them back on and pulled the harnesses as hard as I could, but they kept on falling off.  I spent two hours climbing a few minutes and then putting my crampons on.  Meanwhile, Bruce's headlamp was dying.  We put new batteries in and the headlamp wouldn't even turn on!  I was starting to get cold from sitting and adjusting my crampons, so I decided to push on without them since we were close to the top of the cleaver.  I had to hike 20-30 steps and them shine my light to let Bruce climb.  We finally made it to the top of the cleaver at 2am.  Bruce was falling asleep on the way up.  I started digging a pit at to sleep in, while Bruce decided to sleep on the rocks.  The winds had picked up to at least 20mph.  Bruce was setting up his bivy when he asks me to shine my light.  He can't find his sleeping pad.  I knew exactly what had become of it.  We searched around, but it was obvious that the wind had blown it right over the cliff onto the Emmons glacier.  I offered to dig him a pit to get out of the wind, but Bruce said he would be fine.  I got to sleep, but could hear Bruce moaning for a while in the night.  Had me a pretty nervous.  We awoke at 8am to climbers descending from the summit.  It was completely calm, a little disconcerting.  I shook Bruce awake and he had had a decent sleep despite the moaning.   Bruce prepping to summit. I happened to bivy in a prevalent pee spot... Tried to dig out all of the frozen pee before I went to bed. Waking up at the top of the cleaver. Bruce played around with my crampons and managed to find a secure way to fasten them, so we pushed for the summit at 11am.  I was worried that we would have to descend because of them.  Other climbers were reporting 15 mph wind at the summit, but the winds started to pick up while we climbed.  We decided against bivying at the summit after the crampon and headlamp malfunction and some gear at the top of the cleaver (12,300 ft).  There weren't many crevasses, the biggest on being only 6-8 inches wide.   2000 ft. to go! Looking down from over 13,000 ft. Our bivy spot. We finally reached the summit 3 hours later around 2pm.  Once I saw the crater rim, my energy levels picked up and I lead the way to the summit.  Bruce decided to nap at the summit crater.  I pushed on to the true summit and the register log and signed us in.  Incredibly satisfying to reach the top of Columbia Crest and see everything drop off below me.  On the way up, I was debating about climbing Rainier ever again, but upon reaching the summit I knew I'd be back next year.  I spent over an hour exploring the summit crater before heading down.  It was 16 degrees at the summit with 30-40mph winds, but incredible visibility. At the summit crater. Looking back at the crater from Columbia Crest Summit Crater Mt. Adams and the crater rim. Summit Register Ignore the double chin. Damn balaclava, haha. Signing the summit register Bruce at the summit after his nap. The descent was uneventful, thankfully.  Had enough excitement the previous night.  We got back to Camp Muir around 8pm and spent the night to wait for the snow to melt for the descent.  All in all it was a great trip!

Secondly, ""Ignore the double chin. Damn balaclava"" That made me laugh out loud. Thirdly... what was the deal with your crampons exactly? Why wouldn't they work? I just climbed Mt Hood and one of my worries was having a crampon pop off at the worst possible time. I'm new to mountaineering and even though I did my best to attach the crampons to my boots, it still created a worry for me. Especially when I was really whacking and digging them into the ice wall of the Old Chute. Thanks for this trip report, it was helpful to me. keeganray - Jun 23, 2014 4:55 am - Hasn't voted Re: CRAPons! Thanks! I was renting newer Grivel crampons on my first two attempts and they worked like a charm, but I borrowed some from my climbing partner for my third climb. They were the old fashioned leather strapped crampons. I tied them up and tested them at home on the grass and they seemed to stay on, but the only came off when I was climbing steep terrain. The next day we found that the back strap needed to be crossed around the back of the boot so it wouldn't have any wiggle room to slip off. Didn't have any issues after that. :) solarjinx - Jun 22, 2014 4:53 pm - Voted 10/10 Camera and bivy... I just remembered two other things I wanted to ask you. The camera you used takes such great pictures (I'm still using my smart phone, ugh), you mind telling me the make/model of it? I'm currently shopping for one. Other question: were you able to stay warm enough doing the bivy on the ground thing? I'm considering buying a four season tent, but they're so expensive. I'm just trying to learn and plan ahead. I've got a great Western Mountaineering down bag already and a bivy sack, but I've yet to sleep on a mountain with them. keeganray - Jun 23, 2014 5:23 am - Hasn't voted Re: Camera and bivy... I have a Canon Rebel T3i body and a Sigma 17-50mm f2.8 lens. The lens is a little pricey, but works great for most shots. Just wish I could afford a telephoto too... The Canon Rebels are great camera's, but DSLR's can take a while to learn on. But shooting pictures in RAW format gives you a ton of editing leeway. I was pretty comfortable sleeping in bivy at 12,300 ft. I have a 0 degree bag and slept with my pants and fleece and a 4 foot thermarest sleeping pad and was fine. It was around 15-20 degrees and 25mph winds (Around -5F on the wind chill factor). A couple times I woke up when my knees were sticking out of the trench I dug or when I rested my feet on the ice, but I had good sleep. Next time I'll bring a longer sleeping pad. I was using my boots for insulation under my feet. What's great about a bivy sack is it's only 1lb is quick to setup/tear down. Most 4-season tents weigh a ton and cost a fortune, so I'll stick to bivy sacks for alpine climbs. :) solarjinx - Jun 23, 2014 6:31 pm - Voted 10/10 Re: Camera and bivy... Thank you, I really appreciate your feedback. I'm going to do a trial test with my current set-up and see how warm it keeps me. Happy hiking/climbing! Viewing: 1-5 of 5 to post!

single-day,https://www.summitpost.org/eldorado-in-a-day/202719,Eldorado in a Day,2006-06-20,"Eldorado East Ridge I have had this climb in my mind for the better part of three months, so you can guess how excited I was when we finally decided to go do it. For some reason though we thought it would make a good day climb. Why you may ask, I don’t know. My climbing partners (Brian and Aaron) and I (Jordan) made the drive over on a Monday night to camp in the parking lot, which would allow us to get an early start. Anyone who has had an alpine start knows how hard it can be to get to sleep, so Aaron had the great idea to buy a six dollar bottle of California wine (to help calm our nerves). He also had a bottle of Tequila, but we thought it would be better to sleep, not pass out. After a solid three hours of sleep, we climbed out of the tent into the crisp dark air that can only be found around four in the morning. We took down the tent and threw it into the car, along with all of our sleeping gear. It was time to get the party rolling. We quickly crossed the river on two old trees that had fallen to make a perfect foot bridge. Once we made our way across, the climb began. We had around 2,000 vertical feet of steep wooded trail to ascend. We moved at a slow pace to warm our muscles up. All in all it took us no more than an hour or so to get through the trees. The trail took us under a large cliff wall and out into a large talus field. The next 1,800 feet consisted of juggling our way through the boulder field. It was at this time that my first accident occurred, one of many more that were to come: As I was climbing up one particularly large boulder, I slipped on the moss and started to tumble down the rock. I barely managed to clear a large gap that separated two of the boulders. I finally arrested myself on a rock protrusion. Aaron gave me a weird look and then said, “It’s kind of dangerous to climb behind you” (This was the second time that I have almost bulled him over on a climb). Brian just laughed a little. I gave my right hand a few scrapes, as well as my right knee, but no real harm done. I decided to sit for a little while and clean the blood off of my leg and hand. When I looked across the valley I could see Johannesburg in all her magnificent glory. What a mountain! Finally we were off again. We cleared the first talus field only to find ourselves in a larger one. At the top of this field there was a nice water fall, the perfect place to stop and pump water. We sat for about five minutes (just enough time to down a Snickers bar and a Nalgene of water). Just above the water fall is where the snow line began, which was a nice switch up from the hard unforgiving rock of the talus fields. As we cleared the trees we found ourselves in a beautiful cirque, there was a rock rib guarding our west flank, and Sahale and Torment guarding our east one. Johannesburg stood like a sentinel to our backs. We quickly made our way to the top of the rock ridge, and finally got our first view of our objective. Eldorado looked awesome from the crest. You could see the knife ridge cutting at the clouds as they whisked over its summit. There was no doubt in my mind that we were going to summit. After a little while of dicking around looking for the gully that would take us to the base of the Eldorado glacier, we finally found it. The route description says that it is a class three, but there is no way that it was more difficult than a class two. I guess once the snow melts out a little more and separates from the rock, it may be more difficult. At the bottom of the gully, we decided that it would be a good time to rope up and relieve ourselves. There really wasn’t anything in the way of crevasses, but better safe than sorry. We only had a little ways to go until we reached the saddle at 7,500 feet. Upon reaching the saddle you get a magnificent view of the Inspiration glacier and Eldorado’s East Ridge, or at least we would have if the clouds hadn’t decided to move in on us at that exact time. So we were in for a semi-whiteout crossing of the Inspiration glacier, Yay! I took the lead because Aaron had led to the top of the Inspiration Glacier. All was going well until a section of snow about five feet by five feet sank on me with a hollow “Whump”. Upon inspection with my ice axe, I confirmed the fact that there was nothing but empty space under the snow pack that had given on me. I slowly stepped back and warned the others not to go were I had been. There’s nothing like a hidden crevasse to make you crap your pants. The rest of the crossing was a little slow because I kept checking for crevasses in my paranoid state. All in all I think that I only encountered one “real” crevasse. Finally we were at the base of the East Ridge. We found a nice rock outcrop to take a break on. It was at this point that I switched spots with Brain to let him lead the last 1,400 vertical feet we had left to the summit. After I ate the last of my food and drank the last of my water, it was time to finish what we started. For the most part the ridge was clean of crevasses, but we did have a bergschrund to deal with. Once we got over the ‘schrund, there was nothing left between us and the summit ridge. Brian led the final steps to the base of the knife ridge. We looked up at the ridge and tried to figure out what we were going to do. I have seen many pictures of the knife ridge, and I have never seen it as sharp as it was when we were looking at it. On one side it slopes steeply to the top of a cliff, then drops down around 5,000 feet to Marble Creek Valley to the west. On the other side it is less steep, but after 600 feet it hits the top of a cliff and drops around 2,000 feet to the Inspiration glacier. Either way, you don’t want to slip. After knocking the snow out of our crampons, Aaron and I sent Brian up the ridge with a couple of pickets. He had to front point a little ways on firn on the steeper side of the ridge, while keeping his ice axe on the opposite side for leverage. After about 40 feet of this, Brian managed to bear crawl a ways up. After the first picket was placed, it was my turn to follow. I had to do the same thing as Brian, front point on one side, and ice axe on the other. It was eerie to climb up the ridge in complete white-out conditions. You could see both sides of the ridge, but the steep snow disappeared into the whiteness of oblivion, man it gets the blood flowing. After passing the first picket I unclipped and then re-clipped in so that Aaron would have some protection for his ascent. I could see Brain not far away near the top of the Ridge. He shouted back to me that he wasn’t going to go to the true summit. The true summit was corniced all to hell. There was no way that any of us were going to stand on that thing. Still, Brian, being the unrelenting person that he is, stamped out a platform and stood up on it so that he could stand taller than the true summit (it wasn’t more than two feet away). I finally reached Brian after straddling my way up the last 30 feet or so (not so comfortable on the ass). I now had the pleasure of turning myself around so I could belay Aaron up to us. I have never had such a hard time turning around. I had to balance with one leg, while trying to swing my other leg around so I could mount the knife ridge in the opposite direction. After much swearing and a little awkward balancing, I got myself facing the other way. Aaron soon joined us on the fogged-in summit. While it would have been nice to have gotten a view of the beautiful surroundings, we were all very happy to have made it. Brian snapped a few pictures, although there was not much to see. We then proceeded to make our way down. I belayed Aaron down to the first picket, he then proceeded to crawl/walk his way down until he reached the last 60 feet, which we had stomped flat enough to walk on. I followed after Aaron by scooching on my ass, which was really uncomfortable, until I couldn’t take it anymore. I then stood up and carefully walked my way down. Brian bear-crawled for about 100 feet, then stood up and walked down to join us. We had done it. Now we had to think about the trip down (it was around 2:00 pm). We quickly made it back to the rock outcrop on the base of the ridge that we had stashed some of our gear at. After collecting our gear, Aaron took the lead and marched us across the Inspiration glacier without incident. We attempted to glissade down the Eldorado glacier, but with minimal luck. I decided that it was easier to just plunge step my way down. We reached the base of the rock chute and quickly un-roped. After climbing up the chute, we only had a little ways to go to get to the water falls, which meant water, sweet delicious water. After getting to the water fall and pumping some nectar of the Gods, we started the painful descent through the talus fields. Low and behold, it was here that I had my second accident: While trying to navigate through the snow and rock, I stepped on what I thought was solid snow. You can guess how surprised I was when I plunged into a hole. My shin smashed into a rock, I could feel the bone bend. I very quickly shouted many obscenities and rocked and held my shin like a little kid who has fallen off his bike and scraped his knee. Brian looked at me and then said “yeah, I saw that hole, but stepped over it”, thanks Brian. Aaron asked if I had broken anything, I assured him that I hadn’t. Upon inspection, I found my shin to a weird reddish blue color. I tested it when I stood up, and found that it was ok. So we started down the rest of the way. We finally made it to the end of the talus field, and the beginning of the wooded sections. Man were we happy to be off of the rock! I checked my shin and found that it had swollen to the size of an apple. It looked awful, but really wasn’t that bad. We started down the trail, and no more than two hundred feet down I had my last injury: I caught my foot on a root and went flying ass-over-head down the trail, landing with a thud in a cloud of dust. My head was facing down hill, and my pack and legs had twisted into a sort of knot. I laughed, what the hell else could I do? Both Brian and Aaron laughed, then without a second glance, they took off down the trail, their laughs echoing all the way. I laid there a couple minutes, laughing all the time as the blood rushed to my head. It wasn’t pleasant laughter. I finally righted my self and started down the trail. I was thinking about all the abuse I had endured all day, and wondered how the hell I hadn’t fallen into a crevasse, especially with my luck. I finally met up with Brian and Aaron and tiredly made the last thousand feet to the river crossing. I was surprised upon reaching the other side that I had done so without falling in. Victory was ours, we did it. All in 15 hours, start to finish. We decided that it would be a good idea to jump into the river to clean ourselves off. Man was the water cold, but oh so refreshing and invigorating. We proceeded to pile into the car, and get out of there. What a day it had been!

Congratulations on your climb. jordansahls - Jul 2, 2006 6:36 am - Hasn't voted Re: Good times Thanks, the weird thing is that the ridge was easy to climb for me, just because I couldn’t see how far up we were. For a few moments on the summit the clouds broke, and I could see just to the bottom of the Inspiration glacier. The view down gave me a touch of vertigo, it sure was a thrill. gimpilator - Jul 3, 2006 3:08 am - Hasn't voted Great TR Sorry to hear about the injuries. At least you got to summit. We made an attempt on Sahale three days prior but one of our party was injured at the base of the Sahale Arm turning our trip into an evac. Overall, it sounds like you had a great time.

After Elisha slid down about 50 feet into talus, we had her rope up and down climb equalized on the rope with both rope ends up hill. Image. Two more of us descended next to her to help her stay upright on her injured legs. No broken bones thankfully, just muscle and knee damage. We stayed overnight at cascade pass and had her down by the following evening. jordansahls - Jul 5, 2006 7:25 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Great TR Wow, I'm glade to hear that Elisha didn't have any serious injuries.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/mt-rainier-mowich-headwall-face/297239,"Mt. Rainier, Mowich Headwall/Face",2007-05-24,"Our route up the Mowich Headwall and upper Mowich FaceOur flight from Orange County arrived in Seattle at 6:00 pm, and after a brief stop at REI to purchase stove fuel and food we began the drive to the trailhead at Mowich Lake. As expected, the road was closed at the national park boundary and we had about 6 miles of snowshoeing to reach the lake, where we made our first bivy at about 1:00 am. Snowshoeing up the left side of Ptarmigan Ridge. From Mowich Lake the Wonderland Trail winds through deep old growth forest toward the mountain. Route finding was a little tricky since the trail was under several feet of snow, but became easier once we reached the tree line and were able to navigate by landmarks. Still it was rough going through deep snow and would have been a lot harder without the snowshoes. Our guidebook’s (Mount Rainier-A Climbing Guide by Mike Gauthier) route passes between Observation and Echo rocks before starting the descent from Ptarmigan ridge to the Mowich glacier. However, somehow we started the descent too early and had a long and uncomfortable traverse with significant exposure over steep wet snow and scree slopes. It was hot and the snow had turned into a deep sticky slush. By the time we reached the glacier we were both out of drinking water and had to pause and make more. Every so often there would be the sound of thunder in the distance from massive ice and rock slides. Climbing up the North Mowich glacier toward base camp. But our chosen base camp location was in sight, which we reached after a final grinding 2000 ft ascent. The base camp was on a ridge connected to a large rock outcropping immediately left from the bottom of the Mowich Icefall. We were able to scrape out a narrow ledge just wide enough for two sleeping bags, and somewhat sheltered from the wind. Snowshoes stuck in the snow at the edge created a barrier to keep us from accidentally rolling off in the night. It had been a pretty long day, but it was a good location and a comfortable bivy. So comfortable was the bivy that we failed to get the early alpine start we had planned for. My alarm had been set, but somehow I slept through it. Damn! It’s important to get moving early while the snow is still frozen hard and before the sun loosens rocks and turns the snow into dangerous slush. But crying wasn’t going to help, so after a quick breakfast we packed up for the climb. Our plan was that after summiting we would descend via the Tahoma glacier and traverse back around to this base camp. Since we planned to return and needed to climb light and fast, we decided to leave our snowshoes, trekking poles, and some extra fuel and food here. Our goal was to reach Sunset Ridge via the Mowich Headwall route, 4000 ft of steep 40-55 degree (grade IV) ice as well as some 5th class rock. Today would be the crux of the expedition and a test of our climbing skills. Ice climbing the frozen waterfall at the hourglass constriction on the Mowich Headwall. Just above the frozen waterfalls of the first hourglass constriction on the Mowich Headwall At around 10000 ft is a horizontal rock band standing above steep couloirs full of deep loose snow (although there appeared to be less snow and a wider rock band than in the photos from the guidebook). The rock on Rainier is loose, crumbly, and rotten. Meaningful protection is nearly impossible to place, so we dry-tooled around the couloirs with just a belay anchor. Immediately above this, the rock band narrowed into an hourglass constriction blocked by several frozen waterfalls. We had brought only one set of ice tools between us to save weight, so I led the pitch with the ice tools and my partner jugged up the rope after me. It was a fun test of the ice climbing skills we had been practicing in the Sierras! From here we did a running belay directly up the Mowich face toward a second rock band at 12000 ft, using two snow-pickets, our own two ice axes, and occasional ice screws as anchors. Above the rock band was a towering ice cliff, and as we drew closer we became more and more concerned about the icefall hazard. We could hear the WHUMP sounds of nearby icefall and the thunder of distant avalanches. At some point I was hit with a small ice fall (perhaps a couple wheelbarrow’s worth), and all I could do was make myself as small of a target as possible and let my helmet and pack take the brunt of it. My partner had a narrow miss from a bicycle-wheel sized chunk of ice, but he was able see it coming and jump out of the way. Rock and ice loom over us as we ascend the Mowich Headwall. The whine of projectiles whizzing past us was a constant threat. It seemed like a bad idea to stay on this course, so although our route called for us to navigate through the rock band and around the base of the ice cliff, we chose to traverse up and to the right to join what the guidebook describes as a grade IV variation of the upper Mowich Face. This was a steep 50-60 degree ice slope, but with nothing hanging above our heads we felt much safer. Traversing from the upper Mowich Headwall to the upper Mowich Face variation to escape from the constant rockfall and icefall As we gained the upper Mowich face it became too steep and icy for a running belay, and we switched to standard belays. This slowed us down considerably, and the sun was getting low in the sky. Steep 60 degree grade IV ice on the upper Mowich Face.By the time we gained Sunset Ridge at around 13200 ft. we were very tired, so we dug a trench on the lee side of a snowdrift to partially shield us from the wind and crashed into our bivy sacks. Our bivy trench at the top of Sunset Ridge. When I awoke the inside of my bivy sack (Conduit SL with the 2nd zipper removed to save weight) was layered with ice and the zippers were frozen shut. We had the general idea that we would be descending the Tahoma glacier from here, so without adequately consulting our maps we proceeded like happy fools in the direction of the summit, leaving our packs at the camp. Looking north from near the top of Liberty Cap. After gaining the Liberty Cap, we could see the real summit about a mile in the distance, separated by 1000 ft descent. This was a bit disheartening, but we continued on and reached the Rainier summit at about 10:00 am. The summit overlooks an impressive volcanic crater about half a mile across. Although it is filled with snow, the rim is dotted with vents spewing steam and bare patches of ground. It was a surreal and alien landscape. Off to the south across a sea of clouds we could see the snowy summits of Mt. Adams, Mt. Hood, and the burned out husk of Mt. Saint Helens. A lone crow circled above the crater like an omen of doom. What could he possibly be doing up here a 14400 ft? But the wind was cold, so we started back to our camp to retrieve our packs and begin our descent. By this time we had realized that the col between Liberty Cap and the summit was in fact the beginning of the Tahoma glacier, our planned descent route. Now we had to descent 1000 ft, climb back up to Liberty Cap, descend 1000 ft again, retrieve our packs, climb back up to Liberty Cap for the third time, then start down the glacier! The upper Tahoma glacier has two arms separated by a big rock outcropping, and we started down on the lower arm (closer to Liberty Cap). After descending some 2000 ft and crossing snow bridges over several average sized crevasses we reached the edge of a substantial multi-step icefall. Further progress would require rappelling, and if we continued we would be completely committed. Near the top of steep icefall on the Tahoma glacier, making further descent dangerous and committing. A line of clouds was moving in from the west, and we didn’t relish the idea of whiteout conditions on the maze of crevasses below. We both had a bad feeling about it, so we took a break to reconsider our options. Like the geniuses we had thought we were, we had brought along only the maps of our planned route and had no information on any alternate descent routes. Descending back down the Mowich face was out of the question, and we decided the best thing we could do was climb back to the summit and bivy there. Since it was a long holiday weekend, guided climbing parties from camp Muir would be summiting the next day and we would be able to follow them down. If the weather turned and prevented any teams from summiting, at least we’d be somewhat sheltered and a lot easier to locate than if we were lost on the Tahoma glacier. By the time we started down the glacier we had already accumulated over 4000 vertical feet for the day and were fairly tired, but we made the 2000 ft ascent and took shelter in protected area where the summit log box is kept just over the crater rim. That night we used the last of our fuel to melt some water and to cook one freeze-dried granola cereal meal to share between us. In the morning I once again awoke toasty warm but frozen into a cocoon of ice (my Marmot Helium sleeping bag was simply amazing!) Just as we had hoped, we had hardly finished packing up our gear when we saw climbers arriving at the far side of the crater. They had no problem with letting us join them for the descent, and we made it down to Camp Muir in several hours. After a brief rest, we continued down toward Paradise. Somewhere around 8000 ft we descended into the clouds and the weather quickly turned into whiteout. It was impossible to see more than about 20 feet, but we had no problem following the wands and tracks. However we were thankful not to be out on the Tahoma glacier under these conditions, and I think the decision to retreat back up to the summit saved us a lot of suffering. In any case, we made it down to Paradise by around 5:00 pm. On the way down we had met an exceptionally nice guy who agreed to give us a ride around to the other side of the mountain where we had left our car. We weren’t going to be able to return to our high camp to retrieve our stashed gear, but a couple hundred dollars worth of lost gear seemed like a small price to pay for such an amazing expedition. If anyone is interested in retrieving the gear, I would be happy to provide detailed information on the base camp location. You'd be welcome to keep it, send it to us, or dispose of it however you wish. We learned a couple of major lessons from this trip: 1. Be much more careful in planning the descent. Don’t just trust the blurb in the guidebook. Have maps and information on alternate routes! Spend at least as much time planning the descent as the ascent, especially if the descent is via a different route. 2. Don’t leave your packs unless you are really absolutely sure that you will want to return. Carefully consult your maps before deciding this! Images View Mt.

single-day,https://www.summitpost.org/making-good-use-of-the-longest-day-of-the-year/202422,Making good use of the longest day of the year...,2006-06-21,"Stuart had been on my wish-list for a LONG time. I had stared lustfully at its impressive granite massif from almost every summit in the central cascades, but had yet to actually stand on it. I work full time in the summer for the Forest Service (can’t complain—I get paid to hike:) so multi-day climbing trips are few and far between. There was finally a window of good weather coincident with my days off, so I started plotting my climb of Stuart. My sister’s boyfriend Adam had the same two days off, but had previously arranged a rock-climbing date with said sister for the first day. I attempted many times to convince Adam that Stuart is more attractive than my sister, but either he isn’t convinced, or my sister is really just that evil and manipulative (I’m going with the latter). Long story short: we decided to try Stuart in one day… We woke up at 2:30 AM and left Snoqualmie by 3:15. There must have been some strange cult activity among the animals that morning, as they were consistently suicidal! By the time we arrived in Cle Elum we had narrowly missed hitting two raccoons, two deer and several birds. Adam’s quick reflexes (and stealthy 60's Beetle) got us to the trailhead unscathed, and after some gawking at Esmeralda we started hiking at 5:30. We found snow after about a half mile, and it was patchy all the way up to Longs Pass. Gaining the pass, we were both shocked to see what a big boy Stuart is. The closest I have been to him before is Dragontail, and from there he isn’t nearly so prominent. We were both a little intimidated by how steep the Cascadian Couloir looks from that vantage, but quickly forgot as we enjoyed the glissade down the north side of Longs Pass. We met two other Stuart-bound climbers who had camped on the pass. Dropping down into the trees, we crossed several smaller creeks before finding a narrow, slanted log on which to cross Ingalls Creek. After about 100 meters of bushwhacking, we found the Ingalls Creek trail and followed it down about a half mile to a clearing. We met some campers there who had climbed Stuart the previous day and they confirmed for us that we were at the bottom of the Cascadian Couloir. The bottom of the couloir is brushy, but it opens up to a pleasant, alpine gully before too long. Adam and I had both had some questionable Chinese food the previous day, and were pretty flatulent as we started climbing again. There was much more incentive to lead at this point, as the person behind had to deal with the leader’s odor. At first I would warn Adam before letting fly, but my soft-shell pants had an unexpected timed-release feature (a patent is in the works), making smells difficult to predict… sorry Adam:) At about 7000’ we went to the left into a gully that had some steep, icy snow in it. Adam carefully booted across, and I opted to down-climb to the main gully, noting the unpleasant run-out. I met up with Adam again and we continued up to the top of the couloir without encountering much snow. We took a break on the shoulder below the false summit, kicking back to views of Rainier and the Stuart Range. The snow slope to the false summit wasn’t yet as soft as we would have liked (we were there at about noon). It was also very steep, sloping to 55 degrees in places. We didn’t use crampons, but it was slow going kicking steps and self-belaying. From the top of the snowfield we contoured around the south side of the false summit, enjoying the absolute best in alpine scrambling. Our route took us close to the top of the ridge and over a few unnecessary (but fun!) moves of class four scrambling, but there were plenty of third class options available all the way to the summit. The views from the summit were absolutely superlative! There were low-level clouds on the west side of the cascade crest, and they were spilling through the fingers of Lemah and Chimney rock as they evaporated; what a treat! We were extremely fortunate with weather on the east side! There was hardly a breeze on the summit! It was even kind of warm up there! The register was put there by the Mazamas, but all of the papers inside were soaked! (I’m using exclamations and short sentences here to add to the exciting tone…call it artistic license?) We lingered at the summit for well over an hour, eventually being joined by the twosome that we had seen at Longs Pass 6:30 that morning! We chatted with them for a while before begrudgingly starting our trek down… By the time we got back the snow had softened considerably. I was uneasy about glissading down though, given the angle. Adam stepped off the rock and immediately fell, doing a quick self-arrest. The snow was so soft and steep that plunge-stepping was difficult, and would usually end you up in a sitting glissade position with some initial velocity:) Adam glissaded the rest of the way down without incident (it actually looked so fun that I gave in and joined him). I was using a shorter ice axe than I am used to, and made a proper fool of myself on the first part of the glissade (stopping in plenty of time on an arrest, but looking pretty funny while doing it:) We had previously decided to descend the broad couloir immediately west of Cascadian (Beckey’s Variation number one), as it still had plenty of snow. We were able to glissade down 2000’ and it was an absolute blast! Once the snow ended, we found our way to the bottom of the gully by climbing down a dry waterfall. Probably not the best route, but it worked. The gully terminates in a broad meadow and we quickly found the Ingalls creek trail. We had some luck route-finding on the way back toward Longs Pass, finding all of the right creek-crossings and taking an easy, direct route through the snow. We arrived (exhausted) at the car at 8:00, totaling fourteen and a half hours for the climb, with just over 8200’ of elevation gain for the day. I was so tired that I fell asleep on the Teanaway road, allegedly sleeping through several pretty loud head-thumps against the window. We stopped to gorge ourselves at El Caporal in Cle Elum before proceeding to our warm beds. Stuart really offers some of the best alpine scrambling I have ever encountered, and it is definitely my favorite trip to date! Images View Making good use of the longest day of the year...

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/of-ragged-moons-and-ragged-cheeks/216797,Of Ragged Moons and Ragged Cheeks,2006-08-12,"Ragged-Red Traverse, Aug. 11-13, 2006Stefan informed me at the beginning of this outing that he had landfilled his old shorts with the ripped back side. I was giddy with glee, no more unwanted views of… Anyway, Stefan Feller and I finally accomplished the Ragged Ridge-Red Mountain Traverse. We had both wanted to do the traverse at some point in our lives. It had been done before but possibly not for a while so it wasn’t as if we were breaking new ground. Note that we did not do an “enchainment.” Ragged Ridge and the long ridge of Red Mountain form one long divide some 13 miles in length running roughly east to west but with the western end bending northwestward to Fourth of July Pass. The east end begins at Easy Pass or just northwest of it at the first significant peak on the divide: Kitling Peak (8,002 ft). The eastern six miles of divide is Ragged Ridge (so-named on the map). This ridge features four Washington Top 100 peaks and numerous sub-summits. The Top 100 summits are, in east-to-west and highest-to-lowest order, Panther Peak (aka Mesahchie Peak), Mt. Holyoke (aka Katsuk Peak), Gendarmes Peak (aka Kimtah Peak), and Ragged End (aka Cosho Peak). The parenthetical names are the “official” ones (because they’re on the map) but they are not the “correct” ones. The “official” ones were introduced by one Mr. Fred Beckey even though he’s never been there. His names derive from the Chinook jargon. Mesahchie means “wicked”; Katsuk means “center”, Kimtah means “behind, after, last”, and Cosho means “pig” or “salted pork.” Kind of stupid names, yes? The “correct” names, though not perfect themselves, were mostly established by Dr. John Roper, who happens to have the first ascent of three of them—Holyoke (August 1968), Gendarmes (June 1970), and Ragged End (June 1970). Roper’s register for the latter still exists. Holyoke derives from his then-wife’s alma mater (he made the FA with her). Gendarmes derives from the character of the mountain, and Ragged End derives from the consensus (see next paragraph) that it is the last significant mountain on Ragged Ridge. The west end of Ragged Ridge connects seamlessly with the long ridge forming Red Mountain. The Red Mountain divide itself contains three significant high points: Pk 7533 (413P), called “Pig Tail Peak” or “Pigheaded Peak”, one mile west of Ragged End; Red Mountain’s highest point (7658F, 618P); and Ragged BM (7598F, 238P). There are other lesser crags and sharper sections of crest that I will omit here. If one were to be a stickler for infinitely incidental details, one might argue that Pk 7533 belongs more to Ragged Ridge than Red Mountain since the lower divide (approx. 7,020 ft) is on the peak’s west. But, comparing to Ragged Ridge’s ragged nature, Pk 7533 is actually quite disarming—like a little red-haired girl in pigtails. I will mention that the peak is not red-colored at all but there is red rock between it and Ragged End. Since I had been up the first two peaks on the agenda before, I left this part of the report for Stefan to write… We went out and did the Ragged Ridge traverse this weekend from Easy Pass to Fourth of July Pass. Since Paul had already done Mesahchie and Katsuk, I will just give my personal synopsis on what happened on these two mountains....and then Paul will take over from there on his future trip report. We left the car around 9:00 or 9:30 on Friday, August 11 under cloudy skies, which was a blessing but I was worried about precipitation--fortunately not a licking came out of the sky for this day. We made our way to Easy Pass and started the traverse. Brush was wet and this made my feet wet for two days thereby increasing my normal blistering for a standard trip. But, then again, I haven't been out for a while doing family things and my feet aren’t so tough anyway. We made the basin below Mesahchie-Katsuk sometime around 2:00p.m and I took off in the foggy conditions first for Katsuk while Paul lazed at camp. I took the standard ridge up from Pt. 7430, hit the obvious wall everybody reaches, took a left around it, and up and up and up I went working the easiest of lines and finding cairns. My altimeter read 8500 feet at the ridgeline but fog obscured everything so I saw this one pinnacle and thought that was the summit. I scrambled to its top but did not find a register. Huh? Then the fog cleared almost immediately and I could see the twin summits of Katsuk well to the west. Disappointment. So I scrambled down and worked my way through ribs and gullies over to the real summit area, reaching the eastern summit first. The fog was beginning to dissipate--I could now see well into the north and east but south and west were obscured. I signed the register quickly and then went down and then over to tag the western summit (it looked like to be about the same height) without looking for a register and made my way back quickly. I traversed kind of high eastward towards the fake pinnacle I had earlier reached, dropped about 40 feet to a very nice ledge that cut across and above the slabs that Fay Pullen had mentioned in her trip report. These slabs had concerned me reading her report. My wide ledge with boulders (at about 8400 feet and below the second pinnacle west of the Katsuk-Mesahchie col) cut across the slabs with ease and only required about 15 feet of non-exposed moves on slab-like stuff. I DO NOT LIKE LOW DOWNSLOPING SLABS. I went down another slab-like section to reach the Katsuk-Mesahchie col, and then took the couloirs up to the Mesahchie’s summit. Nicer views this time but not to the west or south. I retraced my route across that great ledge and made it back to Paul in the basin. 5 hours from the basin to both summits and back. The views from camp were so lame I had to paint the scene for you On Day 2 at around 6:00am we set out on the remainder of our traverse—the remainder being most of it. The weather had improved markedly. Now the only clouds were ones low in the valley and they were quick to disappear. I had left my car at the Panther Creek Trailhead as we weren’t going to come out the same way. We were over 16 miles from my car with only six of those miles to occur on anything resembling a trail. And even the trail part was not without exasperation. More on that later. The views were still lame the next morning; more painting We climbed up to Pt. 7430, and commenced the long, lateral hike and scramble, making use of ledges where possible and climbing in and out of the many minor and not so minor canyons by the easiest routes we could find. There are various reports and guidebooks that speak of ledges between 7000 ft and 7400 ft. I would say we made use of the ones at 7400. Our pace was good. When we arrived at the south rib of the Grotesque Gendarmes (the oddly shaped pinnacles southeast of Gendarmes Peak) we found a way through by up-climbing maybe 60 feet of Class 3/4 to attain another ledge higher up. At no point were we stymied on our route selection but there were certainly times where we had to scout a little. Tilted Grotesqueitude (was the world tipping or was it me?) Were the views ever going to get better? I had my doubts I had brought along pictures from John Scurlock of our objective mountains. With this photo of Gendarmes we could ascertain which ledge we were on during the approach under the mountain’s south face. We were on the ledge (snowed over in the photo) that comes in from near bottom-right. In about 3 hours, 45 minutes from camp we crossed the mouth of the large gully that empties the open upper west side of the south face. We proceeded around the corner of the large capital-A shaped buttress, dropped our packs, and made the final scramble to the top, reaching it in just over four hours. The summit tower looked like Class 4 from a distance but turned out to be Class 3. The summit was cozy—especially for the moon beamer. One ragged gendarme this is; third-highest rag on this ragged ridge Views from this high rag; what’s the point of climbing it if this is all you get?    Our next objective was just to the west: Ragged End. From the western promontory sub-summit of Gendarmes I could see most of the route to Ragged End. From our packs, we continued on the ledge nearly to its end whereupon we jogged upward on easy rock to get to the col between the peaks. Crossing here onto the upper reaches of the glacier, we booted up semi-firm firn to the final east ridge. Stefan put his crampons on only because he had brought them. We both got out our ice axes though they too weren’t really necessary. There is only really one steep part for 40 linear feet and there is always a good run out with no crevasses whatsoever. The only concern might have been exposed ice. The end of the rag tops The rag top we had just topped From the east ridge I went out on the middle of the three horizontal ledges visible on the upper south face in this Scurlock photo of Ragged End in an attempt to reach the spiral ramp that leads down to the mountain’s western base. Once at that ramp we’d drop packs and jaunt to the summit. Well, the middle ledge deadended in an alcove where it narrowed then disappeared into a thin horizontal crack in the far rib wall. Of course, on the other side of the rib the ledge continued but climbing out of the alcove required Class 5 and we had no rope nor guts. Fortunately, we had wasted very little time. I spotted the next-higher ledge and so we took that without incident to the spiral ramp. In another 10 minutes we were at the top enjoying our own private packages of Beddar Cheddar Johnsonville Brats. More view suckdom; the blisters on Stefan’s feet might have been more pleasing to the eye   Back at the spiral ramp, we took it easily to the base of the formidable west face then out to begin the Red Mountain portion of the climb. Ragged End’s ragged West Face The first section of ridge out to Pk 7533 goes along a still-ragged edge. I kept smelling sulfur. Was it in the rocks? It was somewhat yellow in color. At one point we were forced slightly off the north side on a ledge bypassing a slanted crest slab. From above, this north side ledge looked flat but when we got onto it it was of the sloping variety with ball-bearing gravel all over it above a cliff. This was definitely the butt-pucker crux for the entire trip. The worst part was the fact that the better, half-a-tread wide footholds were at the base of the slabs just above the cliff. And these footholds were also covered in loose metamorphic peas. We really had to mind these peas and queue up the quality of our climbing expertise. Eventually we dispatched the ledge and got to safe ground where we could check our underwear for excrement. We later applied the name Pigheaded Peak to Pk 7533. The story for this one is Beckey renamed Roper’s Ragged End to Cosho Peak and it is now Cosho that is on the map even though Beckey has never been there. As stated, “cosho” means pig or salted pork in the Chinook jargon. Maybe Beckey was referring to Roper with this priggish pig name (the two haven’t always seen eye to eye or oink to oink). But which one is the pighead? Later, Roper thought Pig Tail would be a good name since Pk 6865 at the head of Panther Creek has the name “Panther Tail Peak.” This alternate name worked for me too—additionally so because I had seen my first mountain lion(s) in Bachelor Creek the weekend prior. Pig Tail Peak from the east Ragged Ridge from Pig Tail Red Mountain from Pig Tail In addition to the lame terrain, we were almost depleted of water so did our best to scan for running trickles coming off of the many small snow and ice patches on the north side of the divide. We saw what appeared to be a good source at a pool at the base of a large snow patch but opted to carry on to the next one. Finally below Pt. 7296 we found running water. It was about 100 vertical feet below the divide and was accessible with only Class 2/3 downclimbing. Just west of there in an idyllic spot with short grass and long views we set up Camp 2 at 5:00pm. I went down for water. Note: it is difficult to scramble up a chossy rock crease with one hand clutching a trekking pole and the other carrying a six-liter platypus bag whose top won’t close. But I only spilled a little bit and we’d still have more than enough for camp. Except for the crescent moon very low on the horizon, an idyllic camp That evening I got to see two moons: one in the sky and one somewhat more grounded. Please pull up your pants, Stefan! The next morning we set out at 7:15 for what was supposed to be a leisurely ridge stroll. We estimated 4 hours to get to Fourth of July Pass then another 2.5 to get to my car down the Panther Creek Trail. But I think Stefan was pained by blains and the weight of 24 feet of duct tape wrapped around his toes. We went over the top of Red Mountain first (no register), arriving there about 45 minutes after leaving camp. Man what a great viewpoint! The moon still slowly waltzed across the welkin but fortunately Stefan’s moon had set…but it would rise again later on! Red Mountain on approach Ragged BM from Red Mountain Red Mountain on departure The next target was Ragged BM 0.8 miles NW of Red Mountain. This summit has two benchmarks on it from 1968. One of them has the triangulating arrow on it pointing toward Mt. Logan. My guess is it points to Soldier Boy BM. Ragged BM on approach The terrain after Ragged BM would eventually grow easier and more like parkland once we got past a few more steep sections of ridge. Stefan was uncertain if it was going to go but I said it would be better than traversing all those boulders in the northeast basin. To our happy feet and clocks, we only encountered Class 3. The terminus of Red Mountain down to Fourth of July Pass Three more sucky views    We could see over to Jack Mountain quite well. Little did we know that friend Martin Shetter would be finishing the Bulger Top 100 List on Jack the same day. Congratulations, Martin! The 24th (23rd) to finish that list (see here for more info). The parkland eventually gave way to blueberries and brush. Ok, the blueberries were the brush. I’m talking about the tall type of blueberry bush (huckleberries?). The ridge went on and on like this. It was this section that would make reversing this traverse much worse. At least we had the downhill momentum advantage, for the tall brush would typically genu-deflect to the side in deference to we peakbagger kings. But it went on and on just the same. At least the last mile or so was through open forest with slippery duff Stefan made the most to introduce his moon to. In six hours we plopped onto the trail. Now we had only the Panther Creek Trail to descend… Stefan had warned me about the lunacy of this trail. I couldn’t understand what he was getting at. I was to come to understand soon enough. But even now, writing this report, I still don’t really understand. Whoever was in charge of building the Panther Creek Trail must have had too little plumber’s ass for the job. The Panther Creek Trail starts out well on descent from the 3,600-ft pass. In about an hour we made it to the creek crossing at 2,400 ft. A new bridge is there but it inexplicably has no stairs on the down-trail side. This means you’ve got to do a Class 3 stem move to a huge boulder or move around the outside of the handrail to step down to a pedestal stair. After the creek the trail traverses under a fantastic wall some 100 feet high that looks ripe for top-roped rock climbing. It is smooth and features nubs and tiny ledges for holds. But the moss is a bit on the heavy side right now. About a mile down-trail from the crossing the trail begins to climb (at 2,200 ft), less than a mile as the crow flies from the car. At first it appears it is only climbing to avoid a nearby cliffy area by the creek. But this is not the case. Before long I’m sweating up a storm on my skin and inside my head as I turn about at switchback after switchback. 30 minutes and 800 vertical feet later the trail tops out just before I blow my top. What in the hell have I been climbing for…in the opposite direction to the car, no less? Almost immediately, the trail begins to lose that 800 feet back in what seems like only 300 yards or so from where I was just ascending it. I just don’t understand. So I sent an email to the head ranger of the park. She didn’t know exactly why the trail does as it does either but she agreed it is an oddity. After 3 hours on the trail (probably a half-hour longer than I needed to be) I was certainly exasperated. So I aspirated my Tecate to make myself feel better. Oh, and the bag of chips too. On the negative side We didn’t get any good views on this climb. The North Cascades have no views. Why did they make it a national park, again? On the positive side In 3 days of climbing over 22 miles we saw only 2 people and this was within the first half-mile of the Easy Pass Trailhead. Ah, the way all mountaineering experiences should be! Maybe the Panther Creek Trail does have one redeeming value. But, oh, did I tell you about the brushy section draped with stinging nettles? On the trivial side This outing satisfied my continuing quest to climb every Red Mountain in Washington State, of which there are nine. I am only speaking of peaks with this exact name, not ones which use Red Mountain as an alternate name, such as Painted Mountain southwest of Glacier Peak or Mount Larrabee. I have three Reds left: one in Benton County (1410F, 720P), one in Snohomish County (5720+F, 1440P), and one in King County (5447F, 727P). {Addendum: as of Memorial Day, 2007 the Benton County Red (sounds like a wine and, in fact, there is a Red Mountain Winery) has been climbed. It was anticlimactic. So now I have only two left.} Stefan's Epilogue: Are you a peakbagger? If you are, then there is a peak open to you on Logger's Island: Rinker Ridge (3760+F, 1360P). A road goes to very near the top. Your car may get scratched a little; high-clearance required. The actual summit is through some trees very near the highest road. No views. The road leaves from Finney Creek Road on the north. The gate there is (currently) open! Do not follow the USGS map because it is outdated. You need a Green Trails map for the correct roads. My epilogue: Please pull up your pants, Stefan!

single-day,https://www.summitpost.org/fun-sun-and-lennox-mountain/784647,"Fun, Sun, and Lennox Mountain",2012-04-07,"Sunrise StumblesTrips do not always worked out as planned. However, sometimes changes in plans and unexpected events can make a trip better than anticipated. This was one of those trips… I woke up early on Saturday morning to pick up a local peakbagging friend, Michael. He was to be the first of several people I would encounter that day for a summit attempt of Lennox Mountain, one of the more prominent yet remote peaks in Washington. However, Michael did not appear at our meet-up location. This seemed odd. Michael acted very interested in participating with this trip beforehand, but he had also asked me to continue without him if he was not at the meet-up location at the designated time. After waiting for a while, I continued driving to Sultan where another person (Fletcher) waited for pickup. I had first met Fletcher during a successful summit trip of Arrowhead Mountain earlier this year. This would be our second peakbagging trip together. The plan for the Lennox Mountain trip was to approach from the north. Another person who would be with us, Dave, had attempted that route during February of the previous day and came within 300’ elevation of the summit before timing-out. We anticipated the combination of Dave’s direct knowledge of the north approach coupled with an attempt during Spring rather than during Winter (i.e. more daylight) would greatly improve our chances of success. Fletcher and I arrived shortly after 7:00 AM at the pre-planned group starting point; the furthest Money Creek Road was plowed and/or drivable by a standard vehicle. I immediately noticed potential problems with our approach. During Dave’s attempt the previous year, he was able to drive over three miles to the furthest plowed location and started hiking above 1600’ elevation. However, for this attempt, we would be starting farther away, adding approximately 3-4 miles roundtrip road-snowshoeing and and extra 400’ elevation gain. In addition, during Dave’s attempt the previous year, the crossing of Money Creek was nothing more than a standard creek crossing. However, for this attempt, the crossing of Money Creek appeared to be more like a major river crossing. Another vehicle arrived ten minutes after we parked. It was Joanna and two of her dogs; we did not expect to see her on this trip because she is generally uncomfortable with crossing creeks. She asked me where Michael was, and I told her that he was not at either meeting/pickup location. She called his brother Josh, who confirmed Michael had left home with the car prior to Josh waking up. Dave and his son Derrick arrived ten minutes later. Dave immediately realized the potential route problems for this attempt. I verified our location using my GPS and we immediately knew we had two choices: Take our chances with the north approach (for which the chances of success seemed less than desirable) or take our chances with a different approach. Prior to the trip, I had mentioned to several people, including Dave, that some friends had successfully summited Lennox Mountain from the east rather than from the north. The advantages to the other approach were clear: The east approach started just slightly higher (1300’) than where we were currently parked for the north approach (1250’), and the east approach did not require any creek crossings. Dave and I discussed the different approach options for several minutes. It was possible we could try the north approach as planned but be stopped well short of our summit goal by a treacherous crossing of Money Creek, thus wasting enough time and distance to waste any summit goals for the day. It was also possible we could try the east approach and not even reach the trailhead due to snowpack impassable for vehicles. I told Dave it would not require too much extra time for us to at least drive towards the east approach trailhead and see how far the road was drivable, so we all agreed to check out that option. I led the drive up nearby Miller River Road but soon became concerned. Unlike Money Creek Road, I started seeing subtantial snowpack on the sides of the road by 1000’ elevation. However, Miller River Road itself was surprisingly barren of snowpack. As we continued driving, the mounds of snow on the sides of the road got higher and higher, and the road seemed to become narrower and narrower. However, for whatever bizarre reason, Miller River Road was plowed all the way to the trailhead (1300’ elevation). This seemed bizarre because Miller River Road is a far less popular roadway than Money Creek Road. The snowplow truck had also left enough space for several vehicles to park at the end, even if only because the truck had needed enough extra space to turn around. Parking at a true starting location for an approach, rather than miles away from it, got our group more excited about the prospects of the trip. Our Convenient Parking Spot Unexpected ArrivalsWe started snowshoeing up the abandoned West Fork Miller River Road at 8:10 AM. The temperature was cold; the skies above were crystal blue-colored. By 1400’ elevation, we started to notice some cat tracks following the snow-covered road, for which later a bobcat was seen by Dave, Derrick, and Fletcher by 1700’ elevation and ran away. While snowshoeing up the road we eventually found several locations where we could see the Lennox Mountain ridgeline. Our anticipation grew larger. First View Of The Goal... Following West Fork Miller River Road... After 1.5 hours and nearly three miles, but only a short distance north of Coney Creek, we turned off West Fork Miller River Road and headed up a semi-open snow slope. After several hundred feet of elevation gain, we side-traversed into a forest and soon encountered an old mining road. We followed this road southward towards Coney Creek, but despite heading the correct general direction the road oddly went downhill (because we did not realize the road switchbacked uphill a short distance behind where we had joined the road). Before reaching Coney Creek, we turned west and headed steeply uphill through the thick forest. We soon encountered the mining road again, which we followed (or sometimes paralleled) for a while until reaching a large basin (2750’ elevation) at 10:45 AM. Following Old Mining Road Route Near Coney Creek... Entering Large Basin Lennox Mountain was visible above the right side of the basin, but the most notable aspect of the basin was the amount of avalanche debris sitting in it. Remnants of a major avalanche had left behind a substantial track of debris and a large snow wall at the base of the basin. We were each very thankful the avalanche had occurred some other day prior to our visit. After a 15 minute break, rather than ascend the open basin and possibly get cliffed-out or encounter avalanche-prone slopes, we began steeply ascending northwest up a forested ridgeline. This forested ridge was very steep, gaining approximately 2400’ elevation in one mile. The travel was slow but steady, with Derrick and Fletcher leading the way. Ascending Steep Forested Slopes Dave and Joanna took a short snack break at 4100’ elevation but I continued following the snow tracks left by Derrick and Fletcher. As soon as I was approximately 100’ above Joanna I heard her shout, “Oh my gosh! It’s Michael!” I looked down the forested slopes and could see a silhouette of a person ascending the ridge towards Dave and Joanna. We would later learn that Michael had woken up late, driven himself to Money Creek Road, did not find any vehicles so he figured we tried a different approach, and eventually found our parking spot. What was even more impressive than finding our parking spot was that he started snowshoeing our route nearly 1.5 hours after we did. He was very fast! The East Ridge ComethThe forest opened up above 4500’ elevation. Derrick and Fletcher decided to stop at a small grove of trees near the top of the steep slope (5200’ elevation). I reached their location 10 minutes afterwards at 1:15 PM, and then Dave, Joanna, and Michael arrived 10-15 minutes later. Frozen-over/snow-covered Coney Lake was around the corner of the ridge from our location, just beyond our sight, and the wind was very breezy and frigid. Southeast Views At 5000' Elevation... Rest Stop At 5200' Elevation Soon after the group rejoined, Derrick and Fletcher headed west to what we hoped would be the summit but what was actually the false summit (5695’). Joanna and her dogs were a short distance behind them, and then followed by Dave and I, and eventually Michael (who was very tired by this stage) continued. Before reaching the false summit, the true summit was in clear view… less than 200’ of vertical gain remaining but still 0.3 miles away. East Ridgeline Of Lennox Mountain Looking Back At Dave Standing Near False Summit Joanna grew concerned of the prospect of taking her dogs across several narrow, and possibly corniced, sections of the summit ridge. As a result, she stopped near the false summit while everyone else continued. There is no faulting her decision; I would rather a person stop short of a summit out of concern for safety than to uncomfortably continue. Derrick and Fletcher reached the summit (5894') first, followed shortly thereafter by Dave and I. Following Upper Ridgeline To True Summit... Derrick and Fletcher Reach The Summit It had taken our group 6h30m to reach the summit from the cars. Michael arrived 10 minutes later, exhausted and rightly so... it had taken him only five hours to reach the summit. The five of us took one group summit photo before the group started to descen. The wind was even more breezy and frigid than it was earlier, and everyone was feeling the effects of the cold. Dave, Derrick, and Fletcher headed back while I waited on the summit with Michael for a few more minutes. Michael had used so much energy and effort to get to the summit I thought he deserved some company and time to enjoy it. Looking West From Summit... Group Photo At Summit The summit views were spectacular, some of the best I have ever seen in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. We could see mountains in every direction. Some snow slopes looked like white-colored pillows. Some ridges had large cornices. Some peaks closer to the Cascade Crest were covered by clouds. Fortunately, the weather and snow conditions on Lennox Mountain were much better than would be normally expected during most April months in Washington. Michael and I began descending from the summit at 3:00 PM. Snow Pillows Looking Southwest Towards Goat Mountain... A Daunting Descent and Final ThoughtsWhile the rest of the group decided to return to the previous rest stop at 5200’ elevation, which required an additional steep ascent, Michael and I did not want an additional ascending so we chose to side-traverse around that particular hill and easily reached our original tracks below it at 5000’ elevation. After the group rejoined, we took a short snack break before continuing down the steep forest slopes. We were hoping that the descent of the steep ridge would be much faster than the ascent had been, but the reality was that some sections were so steep that it required extra caution and time to avoid accidents such as tree wells and sliding. The steep ridge originally took the majority of our group 2h15m to ascend but took 1h30m to descend, much less difference than we had hoped. Final Look At Basin and Avalanche Debris The rest of the descent from the basin to the cars was uneventful. Michael was exhausted, so Joanna and I went back with him while the rest of the group continued ahead of us. Even with extra breaks and a slower pace, Dave, Derrick, and Fletcher arrived at the cars only 15 minutes ahead of us. We were back during daylight and were all safe. We were each tired from the long trip but we all believed the effort was worthwhile. After changing our clothes and packing our gear, we each said our good-byes and went our separate ways. I gave Michael my emergency-stashed “Five Hour Energy” drink in an attempt to help him drive home more awake. He was able to drive home without incident. Having now done a successful summit approach of Lennox Mountain from the east, I cannot fathom why people attempt the north approach. The north approach involves crossing Money Creek (which we discovered during this day could be very troublesome and potentially dangerous to cross), while the east approach does not involve any creek crossing. In addition, Dave informed me that the north approach would have involved some bushwhacking through annoying slide alder despite the deep snowpack, while in contrast the east approach had no brush problems because of the deep snowpack. The east approach might be a long trek, but as a Spring ascent it is a much more straightforward and safe summit route for Lennox Mountain than the north approach. Even if Miller River Road had not been plowed, it would have only added another 1-2 hours to the trip. In that scenario, even including our late (post-sunrise) start on this day, we still would have been safely back on the main road before darkness would have set in. Overall, it took us approximately 11h30m roundtrip to travel 12 miles and have over 5000' cumulative elevation gain. As a Spring ascent while local avalanche conditions are low-to-moderate, as they were on this day, the east approach for Lennox Mountain proved to be an excellent route option and is highly recommended. I hope future summit teams who choose this route will be as successful and have as great a trip as we did on this day.

single-day,https://www.summitpost.org/dickerman-at-dawn/960927,Dickerman at Dawn,2015-11-28,"Mount Dickerman at Dawn Do you remember that feeling on Christmas Eve as a child?  Specifically, the not being able to sleep and imagining what tomorrow is going to be like?  That’s pretty much the feeling I had the night before a planned hike to Mount Dickerman in the Mountain Loop Highway of the Washington Cascades.  I laid in my bed and couldn’t sleep for several hours for a couple of reasons, one being that it would be winter conditions and I haven’t done many winter summits, and the other was my thoughts about how to get the best views.  As a solo hiker 90% of the time, winter hikes have been a little intimidating since the stakes are a lot higher if you make a mistake.  My mind was racing trying to make sure I was bringing enough stuff for a safe trip.  I was also reflecting on a recently featured article here on SP “Chasing the Light” as well as an article that one referenced called “Waiting for the Light”.  Bottom line is I wanted to experience optimal light for this trip.  The articles described the best lighting conditions as the “golden hour” which is the first and last hour of daylight.  My typical MO has been to wake up early enough to get to the trailhead around sunrise.  This has led to some fantastic lighting conditions on recent trips this year, but I noticed a trend; views to the east were often ruined by a bright sun low on the horizon which I often encountered during the first couple hours after sunrise.  Some of the most interesting views from Mount Dickerman are to the east, so to get a good view without that low on the horizon sun effect I’d have to get up there by sunrise.  As I laid there trying to sleep I calculated that I would have to leave my house by 1:15 in order to get to the trailhead in time to make the summit by sunrise which was supposed to be at 7:30.  Well… what time is it now, I wondered?  12:30. Ok, I thought… I don’t really need any sleep anyway, let’s hit the road! I left my house at 1:15am and made the long 3 hour 15 minute drive from my house to the Mount Dickerman trailhead.  By 4:40 I was on the trail.  This was my first time hiking in this kind of darkness so it was a little weird, especially being alone.  My headlamp led the way, and the trail was easy to follow, but man I was dragging.  I felt horrible.  Maybe it was the mere 2 hours of “sleep” I got, maybe it was the 20 pound pack with way too much gear “just in case”, maybe it was because I hadn’t hiked in over a month, maybe it was poor nutrition, or maybe it was some nagging back and hip pain, but I was moving slow.  The first hour I only made it 1.5 miles thanks to several breaks I took necessitated by nausea.  After that I started to feel a bit better and soon I hit snow.  After a couple small patches I stopped to put on my micro spikes.  It was my first time hiking in micro spikes and it was pretty cool.  As I hiked up the well packed trail in the snow, the light from my headlamp reflected on the snow causing a sparkling effect in the snow which was pretty cool.  By about 6:45 it was getting light enough that I was able to turn my headlamp off and just hike in the early morning light.  Shortly later I came to the meadows below Mount Dickerman and saw some of the best morning light I have ever seen.  Dawn from Mount Dickerman Big Four Before Sunrise Sperry and Vesper Before Sunrise Del Campo from Dickerman Monte Cristo Group from Dickerman As I approached the meadows, views of Big Four were starting to come into view with a purple pink light on the horizon.  By the time I could see the group from Del Camp over to Big Four the views were stunning.  Yellow light to the left of Del Campo turned to orange near Sperry and Vesper and faded to pink and purple as it went past Big Four.  Still nearly 20 minutes before sunrise at this point, the views were invigorating!  I sprinted to a knoll in the meadows below the summit.  Well… sprinted as well as I could in two feet of snow with a crust that kept giving way that is.  The views here were ok and I took a couple photos but I was worried that I had just wasted time.  I really had to push hard to get to the summit by sunrise, but I made it!  The horizon all around, the full 360 degrees, was lit with orange and red, blue and purple colors.  It was truly a sight to see and worth all the effort of leaving early and hiking in the dark.  I took a few photos at the true summit and hurried over to the better view point to the east.  When I arrived I took a photosphere and seconds later the sun crested between Sloan and the Monte Cristo group.  I spent the next 45 minutes watching the colors change and taking photos before heading back. Eye Candy Dickerman Summit Dickerman Summit View Baker from Dickerman Three Fingers and Whitehorse White Chuck in Morning Light Jumbo Mountain from Dickerman Sperry from Dickerman Light and Shade Dickerman Summit Panorama (scrollable) It was about 9:30 before I saw another person, about 5 hours after I had started.  On the way down I ran into a couple dozen people before reaching the trailhead, about 5 hours 45 minutes car to car.  I was pretty wiped out.  I probably should have napped as I kept fighting that need to close my eyes feeling on the way home.  Did you know that there are no rest areas from Everett to Olympia?  I kept looking for one, but eventually I felt awake enough to finish the drive home.  I hate that feeling.  All in all a fantastic trip, one of the best in perhaps my best year in the mountains I can remember.  2015 was a truly spectacular year for me and if we get a weather break before the new year, maybe I can add one more summit to cap off the year!

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/no-escaping-the-odds-making-an-attempt-on-mount-rainier/760716,No Escaping the Odds: Making an Attempt on Mount Rainier,2011-07-26,"Introduction This was quite the interesting trip which I learned a few important things along the way. The weather on Mount Rainier was not looking ideal, in the Seattle area it was very misty and raining in the National Park. Rain or shine, we planning on at least giving it a try. Considering that Bentley and his family came all the way across the country for this, we were not going to back down so easy. But at the same time during this adventure we had a few complications that each one could have made a summit bid impossible. We had been planning this trip since September of 2010 who I met Bentley from CascadeClimbers. We sent many emails back and forth figuring out what each of us should bring and getting to know each other. I had no way of getting to Rainier which I told him that my plan was to take some buses and bike as close as I could to the mountain. Bentley at first thought I was joking and then thought I was nutty for having such a commitment for a trip. When adventure calls, you gotta do what you gotta do to cease the opportunity. Bentley generously offered to pick me up from my house making the trip much easier. But easier doesn't mean easy. A Not so Ideal BeginingOn the car ride to Rainier it was raining on the windows which made me all the more thankful that I did not have to ride my bike. With weather not looking so great I was not optimistic about us making the summit. We stopped at the Whittaker place on the way to pick up the retail gear for Bentley and the kids. An hour later we were at the Paradise parking lot ready for the climb. Starting out the Adventure We started out hiking in snow with mist in the air. Travel was at a easy pace, but with heavy backpacks. As we got to Panorama Point the winds were picking up and I could see a dangerous reality forming. Everyone's gloves were getting soaked as well as the rest of the gear we were gearing. I decided to go gloveless to preserve them for later, but unfortunately they got soaked anyways from the water getting in the pack. As we travel on, for at least a few minutes I remember seeing some flakes of snow in the air making me believe it got down to the freezing level. Bentley I consider a trip hero because he was carrying more than his share of gear which was his families. Our pace slows down as the slope get steeper and the atmosphere around us gets darker. Suddenly we hear a roaring of an avalanche coming down the Nisqually Ice Fall which was very constant and massive. Thank goodness the Muir Snow Field is out of harms way. Heading up in Bad Weather Bentley begins to look extremely tired which you could see the look in his face that he was both determined and exhausted. He told me he fell asleep for a few seconds which I offered to carry his 4 season tent. At first he was hesitant, but eventually he gave in knowing that this was for the good of the team for me to take it. After many hours of snow slogging we finally reach Camp Muir. No one else was in the climbers cabin which was very nice to have the entire place to ourselves. We all disassemble our packs which all my gear was soaked, outside it was quite cold. I knew that good weather was our only hope of making it. Before I went to bed I looked outside and to my amazement the clouds cleared and we were above the clouds. Now I could see that there was hope for us making it. But even if we didn't make it, I got what I came for which was for a fun adventure experience. A Day of Preparations and WaitingIn the morning after Bentley made breakfast for the kids, he realized that we were in a bit of a situation. At the beginning of only day 2 we were starting to run out of fuel for the stove. So Bentley and I had to come up with a solution for this problem. I thought of the idea of wrapping a water bottle around something that was black to collect as much warmth as possible to melt snow. Bentley took my idea a step further by using a trash bag, filling it with snow, popping a hole in the edge, and putting it in a bucket that Camp Muir had. This was a very long process that took most of the day to melt 4-5 liters of water, but it very much helped out by cutting the time needed to boil the water by half. Marmot Running on the Snow Gibraltar Rock with Icicles Goat Rocks Above the Clouds I remember being quite thirsty that day, the ranger recommended that I have around a gallon of water per day. I had only a quarter of the recommended amount because we didn't have enough fuel. I sat in the sun on rocks while waiting for my gear to dry out, taking a nap from time to time. The kids finally wanted to do something fun and climb to the top of the rock pile near Camp Muir which was a fun little scramble. Gordon Climbing the Last Section Happy to have this View Mount Adams above the Clouds Mount Saint Helens Muir Peak Panorama Mean while for most of the day Bentley spent most of the day preparing for the climb the next morning. My brother back at home later told me that it was raining in Lynnwood which I found amusing because it was sunny on the mountain. Although we could see the cloud deck rising a little. Cirris Clouds Above Rainier Little Tahoma from Camp Muir Another Camp Muir Begger A Break in the Clouds Evening above the Clouds Upper Nisqually Glacier After spending most of my money from the many climbs I had in July, most of the food I had on this trip was Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich. Once you get to the 3rd and 4th one it starts to make you feel a little bit sick feeling. But at least it was the best of my options of what to bring for having a low budget. That night I make some Mac and Cheese which I found out that it doesn't go so well just pouring hot water into your nalegine bottle. This made my water ""flavored"" for the rest of the trip. After this we tried to get some rest for the climb coming up in a few hours. The Crampon ""Incident""We woke up before most of the guides which we figured we had a head start for the climb. Unfortunately there was one factor that created a bit of drama. When Bentley was putting on Gordon's crampons it turns out that they did not actually fit! His climbing boots were a size 14 which was 1/2 an inch too long for the crampons on fully extended mode. ""Oh ****"" Bentley yelled in anger. I took a look and knew that it was impossible. We spent a good hour and a half trying to get them on, my crampons on the fullest extended mode ""fit"" his boot, but the bar would not go over the crampon. Bentley finally decided to try his crampons, after much forcing and pounding, yelling, and sounds of pain he got them on Gordon's feet. Looking over at Bentley I could see that his hands were bleeding from all the pounding and crampon touching. He said it was very painful which he tried to clean his hands as fast as possible and get on with the climb. Bentley said that he had gotten it on last winter but perhaps did not have it on right back when he thought it fit. I guess the lesson of the incident is make sure not only to see if it fits, but make sure it fits on right and test it out. Making an AttemptSo then we all went outside to rope up and be ready to go. Now we were way behind schedule, but I couldn't help but have the feeling like we escaped the odds so far on the trip. We started out at a nice pace crossing the glacier. As we were walking I could feel the sharp pains of the crampon bars against my blistered heels which made me feel very uncomfortable. A moment later my headlamp fell off my head. And a few seconds later the light bulb fell out! Agggggggg, why does this stuff always happen to me? The headlamp was a donation from someone, but unfortunately the straps are broken which made it so I had to use the headlamp as a hand held flash light. It worked, but felt a little rigged. Ingraham Flats Early in the Morning After passing the Cathedral Rocks we arrive at Ingraham Flats were we had to pass between two crevasses on a snow bridge. Looking East the atmosphere of the night was nearly perfect with the moon shining brightly as it rose above Little Tahoma. A little ways later Gordon announces that he feels too sick to continue. I could see signs earlier on where it looked like he was pushing himself. I admit I was proud of Gordon making this responsible choice here. So without hesitation we all decided to turn around. We decided to wait at Ingraham Flats for the sunrise for safe travel back down. The winds were picking up making it a bit cold. But at the same time the sunrise was absolutely brilliant with many colors, layers, and different lightings. A Moment of Awe Little Tahoma during Sunrise Early Morning on Rainier Sunrise at Ingraham Flats Ingraham Camp during Sunrise Sun Colors on the Mountain Beautiful Cloud Formations Lit up Clouds with the Sunrise Yours Truely on Mount Rainier Getting Ready to Head Out Going Back DownOnce the sun rose, we started the descent down towards Camp Muir. Every time I looked out at the clouds the layers seemed almost infinite, too many for one to count. The hike back down to Camp Muir was decent. Crossing a Snow Bridge So Many Clouds Layers Looking Down on Camp Muir Crevasse Field below Ingraham Camp Once we got back to Camp Muir we had a last snack and got ready for the descent down to Paradise. On the way down one of the kids let me use there trash bag to glissade which made it 10 times better and faster. We saw a few interesting sights on the way down like a rock fall above the Nisqually Ice Fall, a very cute chipmunk, and a dark atmosphere as we went back into the clouds. Glissading Down Camp Muir The Last of our Views Deer Taking a Rest Rocks Falling onto the Nisqually Glacier A Cute Chipmunk When we finally arrived at the trailhead, Bentley's wife had been waiting there of a while excited to see us. As I opened up the car I noticed my doughnut was gone. ""Where's my donut?"" I asked in disappointment. ""Oh it was getting old in the car. But don't worry, dinner is coming soon"" I was told. We had more fun talks as we enjoyed dinner at Ashford. The Wall family did a nice thing of driving me all the way back home. Very much appreciated. We all learned a few things during this journey up Mount Rainier and had some fun experiences together. In less than 2 days I was back doing what I do best. Going on yet another big adventure.

single-day,https://www.summitpost.org/fragile-on-the-edge-climbing-burgundy-spire-on-friday-the-13th/868842,Fragile on the Edge: Climbing Burgundy Spire on Friday the 13th,2013-09-13,"Introduction Inspiration for the Climb""The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings."" - William Shakespear ""Man propose, nature dispose"" - Gary Paulsen After climbing for four days in a row I came home feeling exhausted and dehydrated. Matt Lemke calls me by saying ""want to climb Sloan Peak via the rock route"". It was a tempting offer, but I declined due to being fatigued. Then Shortly afterwards I was offered a trip so ridiculous that I couldn't refuse. Burgundy Spire via the North Face. Some say Burgundy Spire ranks as #10 on Washington's hardest peaks. Before climbing it I knew that I would be climbing at the edge of my limit and that with how I felt this would be a big under taking. I had prusiks just in case and felt that with all the years of mountaineering it would be enough. Unfortunately I was wrong. At the crux I fell and took a big swing fall which ended up being one of the scariest moments of my life. This was a scary climb that put me on the edge of what I thought I was capable of. We worked out a deal so that I would have a semi rest day before climbing Burgundy Spire. As a pre-trainer we went to Mount Erie and did a few rock climbs to help me ease back into it. After a few hours of some good climbs it was time to head over to Rainy Pass where we met up with Fletcher and Gimpilator. They didn't climb with us, but it was nice to get a few chats in. Matt Lemke Rappelling on Mount Erie Leading Up to the IncidentThe next day we drove on over Washington Pass and then over to the Silver Star pullout. We started hiking at about 7:20 a.m. down a bouldery path. Once we were in the woods, the trail became sustained which I was pleased. The trail crossed the creek, there is a few logs to use for crossing. A little ways after the log crossing. the trail steepens up. I could feel the burn from my previous climbs, but knew I could endure it. After about two hours in, we cross through a flat camping area which made for a great rest spot. Once I refueled, the traveling was easier even with the more difficult terrain. Further ahead the trail became less obvious but at least there was cairns. The terrain went from bad to cruddy, there was kitty litter everywhere. I'd rather free solo low 5th class than go through this class 2 scree. At least it would be safer. Liberty Bell with Highway 20 Scrambling near Burgundy Col Walking along a Camp Zone Matt Impressed with the Face Panorama from Burgundy Spire - Photo by Matt Lemke After blasting through more garbagy slopes we arrive at the bottom of the north face of Burgundy Spire. We put on our harnesses and left behind some gear to make the climb easier. I led the first pitch which was quite decent. After I belayed Matt up, he led the rest of the pitches. We were not sure where the 5.8 sections were. I've only led up to 5.7 which is why I let Matt do the rest of the leads. The next pitch was class 4 with some kitty litter in it, the worst pitch of the route in terms of quality. Then on the 3rd pitch we climbed up some 5.4 flakes. The climb was going well, I started to think that this climb might actually go drama free. Looking up the First Pitch Myself Leading up the First Pitch View from the top of the First Pitch Starting up Loose Flakes on Pitch 3 Matt Leading the 3rd Pitch Matt Leading the 4th Pitch The next pitch is possibly the crux pitch, at least it was for me. It took Matt quite a while to climb it. ""I guess this is where it gets hard"" I whisper to myself. As I approached the bottom of the crux I realized why it had taken so long and that I would have difficulty getting up it myself. The hand jam business was working out fine at first. I pulled out a cam and tried to go higher. I had a hard time getting a good hand jam and I was just feeling fatigued as I tried to climb higher. Breathing hard I push on for the next move. I was almost to the top when I started to tire out. My grip was failing, I was now trying everything I could do to hold on. In a pathetic attempt I yelled softly in a desperate voice ""Matt, catch me ca..."" and then my grip completely failed. One of the Scariest Moments of my LifeI don't entirely know exactly how it went down considering that I immediately went into panic mode. As I fell back I could see the landscape all around me changing. In a sort of free fall I look down below me and dread what lies ahead. My heart was racing, and I finally understood what the phrase ""I saw my life flash before my eyes"" meant. Falling side ways is much scarier than I had imagined it being. After what felt like a long time I smacked into the slope hitting the back of my head. I spun around and kept flying. I didn't know what was going to happen to me. The final impact was the worst one. I crashed into my left knee and left arm. I think I felt it pop. When I stopped I immediately was in some sort of mental shock. It wasn't until then that I realized that was one of the scariest moments of my life. My vision dimmed, my body was aching, heart was racing, breathing hard, and I knew I had really messed up. I had cuts on all my legs and arms, the most worrying part was my knee bleeding down my leg. After more heavy breathes I could finally feel the impact which I started yelling in pain. I managed not to swear, although I was quite tempted to. After about 10 minutes, I felt around me and realized I could walk. I was quite pleased. Each movement was quite painful, but at least I was well enough to get off the face. I had to finish the pitch before I could think about patching myself up. Casual rock climbing moves were now quite difficult. I traversed over a slabby section and found a crack I could go up. After some moaning, pushing, and pulling I made it to Matt. On a tiny ledge I clipped in and he helped bandage my leg. We poured some water on it to get as much dirt out as possible. Each wrap was difficult considering the precarious position I was in. I had one leg in front of the other on a less than ideal ledge. At one point I almost fell from having difficulties wrapping the bandage. Once it was sealed tight the bleeding seemed to slow down which I was quite pleased about. Fragile on the EdgeIt seemed like we were incredibly close to the summit, so I figured it would be best to get to the top and rappel down from the proper area. I suppose it was possible to rappel from where we were, but I didn't want to risk it. What I didn't know is that there were more traverses and pitches. As I belayed Matt I was shivering. I couldn't tell if it was from the blood loss, the mental shock, or being fatigued. Seeing that I wasn't a natural born mountaineer, it wears down on me. Being told that it's out of my realm. ""Maybe they were right"" I whisper as tears start coming down my face. ""But at least I made it so far"" I chuckled with a hint of hope. Matt arrives at the top of the pitch, which it is my turn to start climbing again. ""Another dreadful pitch"" I whisper and sigh. Looking up the 5th Pitch? The further I climbed, the more fragile I felt. With more difficult moves, I managed to surprise myself with what I can do when feeling injured. I guess part of it had to do with the fact that I felt very desperate. Survival mode pops in and one must keep himself as calm as possible. From stemming, hand cracks, foot jams, and other climbing moves I was impressed at how much the mountain kept throwing at us. The pitches began to blur and I started to wonder when we would top out. We arrived at another traverse section that required my full attention because I didn't want to take pendulum swing. The idea of falling 2 feet sounded terrible. The slightest bump on my knee hurt (it's hurting as I'm typing this over a week later). After what felt like a long time we arrive at the summit ridge pitch. Looking up at the Upper Pitches The Beginning of Pitch 7 On the final pitch I went up the 5.8 crack and then traversed around a fin. Then I had to climb a 25 foot off-width crack which stemming and foot jams were a great method for getting up. After enduring that last bit I arrived on the summit ridge and walked over to the summit rock. I set down the pack and touched the summit. I was so thankful to be almost done with Burgundy Spire. ""Matt, thank you so much for leading most of the pitches, being patient, and helping me when I was hurt"" I told Matt. We had a short break on the summit and got ready for the descent. Silver Star Summits Burgundy Spire Summit Impact Damage from a Fall Matt Lemke on the Summit The DescentDouble ropes were nice for rappelling down. I was quite pleased that getting off the face didn't have any major difficulties. Even with double ropes there was one spot that was a bit hot on my hand due to friction. Many rappels later we had to go through the kitty litter section which we were both worried about the rope getting caught. Lucky for us it didn't get caught. On the 5th rappel the rope got quite tangled, but fortunately Matt figured it out and soon arrived safely at the bottom of the climb.

The sun was almost setting and we had thousands of feet to go. The scree on the way down was quite bad, we both kept slipping. At one point I almost lost my full balance while sliding on a slope. I dug in my fingers to catch myself which took a few seconds to stop. As the sun set, the evening view was refreshing and the scree eased up. I decided to put my camera away.

I wanted to get home as soon as possible to wash off all the cuts. Once it became dark I had a hard time keeping up with Matt. I kept sliding on the scree trail and fell on my back. Somewhere during that time of falling over and over I unfortunately broke my main camera. After falling behind so much I decided it was best to go at the pace I felt comfortable with which is why I slowed down a bit more. As we neared the bottom we could see head lights above as cars drove along highway 20. We then crossed the creek and started the ascent to the car. ""This is the crux of the climb"" Matt announced to me as we struggled up the hill. We took a few breaks and pressed on. Finally we arrive at the car where we set down our gear. ""I made it"" I announced with joy. What a day! ConclusionA few things to take away from this: - Don't climb a super hard peak after being exhausted from climbing a bunch of other peaks - Both party members should do their homework before a climb, not just one (My Bad) - Protect the Traverse - Climbing at one's limit in the alpine is dangerous, even with prusiks - When falling a lot on scree, make sure your camera is in a safe location In conclusion there were a few things done wrong on this trip. It's now over a week later, I can softly walk around the house and go for short walks outside. I had to visit the doctors to get antibiotics and make sure nothing was broken. It will be a few more weeks before I can even consider hiking again if all goes well. I've learned my lesson the hard way, and am happy that it wasn't more serious. May my camera be fixed and eventually I hope to get back into the swing of things.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/salmon-la-sac-two-stellar-days-one-sweet-world/872003,Salmon La Sac: Two Stellar Days - One Sweet World,2013-08-31,"One Blunder - One Miscalculation I had considered calling this TR How to Ensure You Won’t Summit Chikamin Peak. I’m sure such a title would have been more intriguing. And yes, it is true that I did not summit Chikamin. Nothing epic, just one really stupid decision and too conservative of a turnaround time cost me several hours, which probably would have been enough time to finish the job. But I choose to go with the more positive title, because the stellar scenery along with the overall positive experience I had while in the Salmon La Sac area for those two days far outweighed the disappointment in not summiting.   Glacier Lake and the Three Queens This was the last leg of my first trip in the North Cascades. For a long time leading up to the trip I debated between hitting the Enchantments or hiking in the Salmon La Sac area for these final two days. In the end I chose Salmon La Sac, for two reasons. First, Chikamin Peak came highly recommended, by at least three SPers. They all said the Glacier Lake Route was something worth seeing, and they were all correct! Second, it was Labor Day weekend and I assumed that between the two areas the trails in the Enchantments would be busier. I figured Salmon La Sac would be busy too, but I assumed the Enchantments would be a zoo, and I was hoping for at least some solitude. Salmon La Sac also had the advantage that it would be less than a two hour drive to the Gorge Amphitheater, where I would be heading on Sunday. So I booked my campsite for Friday and Saturday night and started researching. I knew I would shoot for Chikamin on Saturday, so I just needed to find a hike for Sunday morning. Alone on Jolly MountainAfter leaving North Cascades National Park on Thursday morning, I headed for Ellensburg with my son Andrew and his friend Andy. They were heading to the Gorge for the DMB shows all weekend and one of the exits off of I-90 was where they were meeting their friends on Friday morning. This was a welcome change of plans that would allow me to go hiking on Friday. My original plans did not include a hike on Friday as I was going to have to drop the boys off at the Gorge so I just planned on making it a rest day as I figured it was going to be too late for me to get a hike in by the time I dropped the them off and made it to camp. Fortunately there was a change in plans and an additional vehicle was thrown into the mix and they were going to be able to catch a ride. As long as their friends arrived early on Friday morning I had a shot at a hike. I told Andrew to tell them to get there early! Fortunately, the drop off happened around 10 AM. I had plenty of time now for an afternoon hike! So the boys headed for the Gorge and I turned the car west and headed for the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, for what would be two stellar days solo on the trail. I made it to the Salmon La Sac campground, found my campsite, set up my tent and was at the trailhead around 11:30 AM. Originally I had planned on hiking Jolly Mountain on Sunday morning as it would have been a good choice for a half day hike. But now that I had an extra half day of hiking time allotted to me Jolly Mountain made the most sense as the trailhead is very close to the campground and with about 11 miles and 4000 feet of elevation gain I knew that I could get it done before dark. In reality, it was the only good peak option I had with the time available. Everything else I was interested in involved more miles, more elevation gain, and a 12 mile drive down an unpaved road. I read about Jolly Mountain just a few weeks before the trip, and I am glad I stumbled across it. The Mountain Page talks about the incredible views from the summit. And that would be an understatement! It was a walk up besides, so a good choice if time is limited. And in the truest sense of the word, Jolly Mountain is a walk up. There wasn’t a single step off trail all the way to the summit, except of course where I choose to step off of it and get a better vantage point for shooting pictures (a lot of pictures). I parked at the Cayuse Horse Camp and was surprised that there weren’t any other cars in the “lot”. While it was Friday, it still was Labor Day weekend, so I figured the trails would be busy and I would be seeing a steady stream of hikers, but I was wrong. I would not see a single soul from start to finish! While I loved the solitude, I felt a little bad that I had inadvertently lied to my wife. She wasn’t real thrilled with me hiking alone these last two days of the trip. But I alleviated her concerns by informing her that the trails would be packed, and that while I would be hiking alone, I definitely wouldn’t be alone. Based upon what I saw on my four other hikes that week, the trails in the North Cascades are very busy. Well, much to my surprise that was not the case, on Friday or on Saturday. For the first four miles of the hike, it was mostly a walk through the woods. There were a few open areas that offered some good views to the ridgeline, but mostly I saw trees. This wasn’t a huge disappointment as there were still a lot of clouds overhead. The storm system from the four previous days was due to move out, but it was taking its time. Jolly Mountain Trail By the time I made it to Sasse Ridge the clouds started breaking up, and that was a good thing, because all the way from the Sasse Ridge junction to the summit the views are unobstructed. As the trail wound around the ridge I had nonstop views to more peaks than I could count, including: Lemah Mountain, Chimney Rock, Mount Daniel, Mount Stuart and the Enchantments. The fact that I was able to enjoy the views in complete solitude only added to the experience. First open view from Sasse Ridge Lemah Mountain and Chimney Rock Mount Daniel Mount Stuart and the Enchantments in the distance to the far right Of course I also knew that this solitude could get swept away in an instance by the sound of a two cycle engine. The trail to the summit also happens to be a multi-use trail and I noticed fairly fresh tire tracks on Sasse Ridge. Fortunately no one, or any vehicle showed up, and I had to resort to a Splattski for my summit mug shot. Solitude on a summit! What a good problem to have! Summit View Lemah Mountain and Chimney Rock Mount Daniel   Mount Stuart and the Enchantments I spent nearly an hour on the summit, which reminded me of my favorite line from A Slender Thread. We had to be grateful for our forty-five minutes into which was crowded the worth of many hours of glorious life. The skies continued to clear up as I descended, which made the views that much better.       I made it back to camp, had my supper of one ham sandwich and some Cheezits and then proceeded to relax and soak in the stellar day I had, with a good fire and some Mirror Ponds. Life is good…   Glacier Lake, and then some, but not Chikamin PeakI knew that today was going to be long so I wanted to get a fairly early start. I left camp and headed for the Mineral Creek Trailhead expecting to get there by around 7 AM. The drive took a little longer than I expected and I didn’t get there until 7:30. It was five miles further than I thought, and those last five miles are unpaved! I had missed a few details in the planning, and this would end up being a theme that would repeat itself a number of times over the course of the day. When planning for my hiking trips I rather enjoy sweating the details, but unfortunately in this case, some important details evaporated due to a lack of time caused by a rather hectic work schedule the last two weeks before leaving. I had enough beta to get me to the summit. I just should have studied things a little closer, and maybe the results would have been a little different. There was only one other car at the trailhead, which again amazed me. It was Saturday and the trail should be busy. It wasn’t! I wouldn’t see anyone until I made it to Glacier Lake. The first few miles of the trail were uneventful as the trail was well graded and there was the occasional break out from the trees to see the ridgeline. But after the stream crossing around two miles in the trail abruptly changes. The Mountain Page clearly states that there is plenty of brush until you reach Park Lakes, and that would be correct. The trail narrowed and the brush was thick. Keeping my arms up in the air to push away brush was a necessity at times. After less than a mile of this my hiking shorts were completely soaked from all the dew. There was an occasional break in the brush where I would be able to clearly see the trail but it wouldn’t last and I quickly found myself back on the overgrown trail. This fight with the brush went on until I reached Upper Park Lake, which is a beautiful setting, where I spent some time soaking in the views. Mineral Creek Trail Mineral Creek The Never Ending Brush! Falls Below Park Lake Upper Park Lake I made it up to the end of the Mineral Creek Trail at the junction with the PCT. From here I just had to find the boot path leading down to Glacier Lake. This was my biggest concern for this route. I wasn’t sure if the turn off was going to be obvious or not. The Route Page mentions a saddle and a beautiful view north. Well, this would be my big blunder for the day. There were a few areas that looked like they could fit this description, and when I reached the correct turnoff I chose to keep walking by. There was a boot path, and then there was the makeshift cairn, consisting of an axe with a few rocks surrounding it. The clues were all there, but I got hung up on the words “beautiful view north”. There was just some grass, rocks and trees here, and besides, I could see up the trail further and there appeared to be a pass which looked like it would guarantee beautiful views north. My instincts were screaming that I was at the correct junction – Just walk up the bootpath a little way and see what is there. But I chose to ignore my instincts and continued up the trail. Maybe if my options were hiking through some brush or hiking up that boot path I would have chosen the boot path. But it was the PCT, and the scenery sure looked beautiful! This decision would cost me about an hour of my time, but I just can’t bring myself to say that it was a waste of time. If I should have been in a hurry, concerned about the clock that was clicking down the daylight hours, I wasn’t. Later on I counted the number of pictures I stopped to take during this little side trip, and they numbered over 20. Even when I reached that pass and figured out that yes, I had made a mistake, I still headed up the trail a little further. The view from this pass was beautiful; it just wasn’t the correct beautiful view. I continued until I got a great view of Mount Thomson and Huckleberry Mountain and then finally turned around to get back to the day’s objective. The Three Queens Alta Mountain View from the ""wrong"" saddle Mount Thomson and Huckleberry Mountain I got back to the saddle, walked up the boot path a few hundred feet and there it was. The beautiful view north! And for the next few hours I would enjoy some of the most stellar scenery I’ve had the pleasure of witnessing. Glacier Lake is a true alpine gem! The Correct Saddle Chikamin Peak and the Beautiful View North Spectacle Lake from the saddle I mostly followed the boot path for the 600 foot descent to Glacier Lake. The path is pretty narrow and there are a number of side paths so I got off track a number of times, but Glacier Lake was clearly visible. I made a few mental notes on the way down to make sure I would find the correct way on the hike out. The Way Out I reached Glacier Lake and saw a few tents. When I crossed the main outlet stream I finally saw the first of only a handful of people I would see all day. I slowly made my way around the lake counterclockwise. I say slowly because I was stopping pretty often to soak in the scenery and to take many many photos. Chikamin Peak Glacier Lake The Four Brothers The Three Queens When I thought I was all the way around the lake I started up a short boulderfield. Unfortunately this was the wrong boulderfield. Fortunately, it didn’t take long for me to cliff out and see that there was more of Glacier Lake hidden behind this cliff. After a quick scramble down I headed up the correct boulderfield. The scrambling in this gully was fun! The boulders are huge and solid. There was one particularly huge rock jutting up at the top of the gully, which I eventually realized is the “cairn” for the route up this gully.  Click on photo for route info. By now it was around 1 PM and I had to start thinking about deciding on a reasonable turnaround time as I wasn’t interested in hiking out Mineral Creek via headlamp. I have hiked many miles by headlamp so that wasn’t a concern. But all I could remember was how overgrown the trail was, and getting off trail in the dark seemed like a reasonable possibility. Besides, I was alone, which made me even less thrilled with hiking via headlamp. Based on that I gave myself a 2:30 cutoff. I’d see where I was at that time and then decide what to do. I followed the inlet stream for a short time and then veered left to head up the talus slope that would lead to the slabs below the Four Brothers/Chikamin saddle. Here I made a decision that fortunately did not cost me time. When I was hiking around the lake and looked up at the route I noticed a “ramp” above the talus. From down below it looked like this might make for a good route option. When I got to the talus, in short order I decided to go for the ramp. The talus up this slope is as loose as any choss I have ever encountered in Colorado’s San Juan or Elk Ranges. The ramp looked like less of a hassle so I headed that way. There was still loose rock here, but not as bad as the talus slope. Near the top of the ramp I eventually reached a small ledge about four feet high or so as I remember. It looked awkward to get up and over so I considered going down a narrow ledge to the left. The bottom of the ledge connected back near the top of the talus slope. I thought about heading down the ledge for a brief moment but it was too narrow – and exposed – for my taste. If I fell, it wouldn’t have been a very long fall, but the end result wouldn’t have been pretty. I headed back over to the ledge, and I was right, as it was little awkward getting over. Shortly after getting over that obstacle just a little further up the ramp was a short gully that put me back onto the standard route. The view of the talus slope is blocked by the trees The ""Ramp"" I made my way up the slabs, which was a nice change of pace as the rock was completely solid. It was now after 2 PM and I ran into two guys coming down. Based upon their feedback, I still had a ways to go. At this point I accepted that I was not going to summit. I was now at about 6,000 feet; just 1,000 vertical feet to go. Time was running out for the summit, but being this high on the slabs I still figured I could make it to the saddle. I continued up a little farther but realized today was not my day. It was only 2:15, but I decided that there was no use pushing it and that I should slow down and enjoy the beautiful setting I was in. I dropped my pack and took a short break, and was more than content. I think I knew for so long that I was going to run out of time that I it didn’t bother me to just stop there. I remember feeling the most content I ever had when missing a summit. Looking towards the Four Brothers/Chikamin Peak saddle Chikamin Lake The Three Queens I snapped a few pictures and headed down. I would continue to snap more pictures on the descent as well. I decided to take the talus slope on the descent versus the ramp and confirmed that it was very loose. I sent rock down the slope several times, and if I make it back here again I will definitely be bringing a helmet.   View of the ""Boulderfield Cairn"" on the descent Glacier Lake Tarn The hike down and around the lake and back up to the PCT was uneventful. Of course the 600 feet of elevation gain on the hike out was tough! I started seeing some backpackers, coming down to Glacier Lake from the PCT and then on Mineral Creek as well. I couldn’t help but be impressed with their fortitude. Backpacking into Glacier Lake via Mineral Creek would be no easy task. But in retrospect, that is the way to go for visiting the area. I could easily see spending a number of days here. And backpacking would allow for a much slower pace and make for a more relaxing and peaceful experience. I made it back to the trailhead and realized that I gave myself too conservative of a turnaround time, as I still had about an hour of daylight left. I also realized that the last two miles of Mineral Creek Trail would have been fine to hike out via headlamp; the trail is wide and graded and there is little brush to deal with. I easily could have pushed my turnaround time to 3:30 or 4:00 PM, which would have given me a fighting chance at summiting. I still would have had the crux move, the bunk beds, to get through and who knows if I would have make it through that, but still, a fighting chance. I drove straight into Roslyn afterwards. I needed some hot food and some supplies. All the ice in my cheap styrofoam cooler had melted by now so the remaining Mirror Ponds were luke-cold at best, plus I needed some more firewood. Despite not summiting I was feeling really good. With the volume of stellar scenery I got to see in the past two days I couldn’t help but be in a great mood, so I planned on staying up late celebrating, so ice and firewood were critical at this juncture. Fortunately the General Store in Roslyn had the necessary supplies and the Old # 3 had a pretty good burger and fries, along with a decent draft beer selection. I headed back to camp and enjoyed a beautiful night under the stars, with a roaring fire and ice cold Mirror Ponds. It was the perfect way to end a great first trip to the North Cascades. From the Wilderness to the Wild I still had Sunday morning available for a short hike but on Saturday night I decided that I should probably just forgo the hike and head to the Gorge. In reality there weren’t any hikes that I wanted to do that I could complete by early afternoon. I was most interested in Mount Daniel, which I knew would take the better portion of the day. Add in the 12 mile drive down a dirt road, and I knew that it wasn’t going to happen. If there was one thing I learned over the course of the week is that I underestimated the amount of drive time to the trailheads. And even though my heart said “Go for a hike!” my knees were telling me something completely different. My attempt at Chikamin made for a hard day, and while I enjoyed my slow time around the fire on Saturday night, I wasn’t moving very fast, even after 800 mg of Ibuprofen. Besides, I wanted to get to the Gorge so I could spend the day with Andrew. On Monday he would fly home to Chicago and I would fly home to NE Indiana. So it was an easy decision to pass on a hike. With that decision made I was able to slow down and enjoy my Saturday night by the fire, and it also made Sunday morning that much more enjoyable as I was able to take things nice and easy. As normal, I woke up early Sunday morning so I took my time breaking down camp and loading up the car. I drove into Roslyn and hit the Roslyn Cafe for breakfast, which was a great choice. I highly recommend Cody’s Biscuits and Gravy! I reached the Columbia River around 10 AM and stopped at the overlook off the interstate to take in the views. It’s a beautiful area, which made me think that the Gorge was going to be a pretty special venue for a concert, which would be correct. Despite the sea of people in the Gorge camping area the afternoon was much tamer than I expected which was fine by me. I spent the time relaying my tales of the previous two days to Andrew and Andy while we browsed through each other’s cameras reliving our days on the trail from the past week. Showtime eventually arrived, and the band opened with One Sweet World, which made me quite happy. I even guessed correctly that that would be the opener. I always seem to have a song running through my head when I am on the trail, and on Friday and Saturday, One Sweet World had made the “trail set list"".

I printed out some of your photos and used them during our trip up Chikamin. Our trip when off with a single issue and all your advice was right on. I totally agree with you on how goregous the Glacier lake area is. It is worth taking the extra time to go down to Glacier Lake on your way up to Chikamin. We did the trip in 11 hours round trip from the mineral king trailhead. It makes for fast travel when you have no route finding issues.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/west-ridge-of-west-garfield/823377,West Ridge of West Garfield,2012-10-09,"West Ridge of West Garfield TRTLDR version On the 9th, 10th of October 2012, Colin B. and I climbed the West peak of Garfield via the West ridge. The West Garfield group consists of 5 peaks total with the highest peak being Garfield West itself which is situated in the center of the group. Four of these peaks lie along this East/West trending mountain ridge with the Infinite Bliss Summit the Eastern most of the group. One of the peaks is on a spur ridge Northwards from Garfield West. This was the culmination of an off and on 3 year project. The Garfield West summit was first climbed in 1940 via the West ridge. Virtually no route information was available so it was an exploratory climb. We approached and gained the ridge from a different direction and location than the first ascensionists. We simuled most of the way and bivied on a flat spot on a bench to the North of the I.B. summit. We only took 3 quarts of water each and ran out by the morning of the 2nd day. There was no water or snow anywhere on the route. We were unsure of which summit was actually Garfield West and we only had time to summit the tallest peak. We thought at the time that Garfield West was the next one on the ridge, which meant we had failed to summit. Back at the house I looked again at the topo and determined that we had indeed climbed Garfield West. It was a lot of scrambling, a lot of mid fifth with some 5.6, 5.7. and lots of big exposure. Very little bushwack on the approach and most of the trees on the ridge were avoidable. Remarkably clean rock if you stayed right on the crest but not much gear, mostly slinging trees. The plan was to descend south from the saddle between the I.B. Summit and Leaning Spire but with scary conditions and an arrested fall we retreated to the I.B. 60m rap line with our 50's and only the memory of looking at the topo a few years previous and never having climbed it.

Put it on full screen, the Go-Pro lens really makes this climb look wild. -------------------------------------------------- THE TREACHEROUS CONUNDRUM TRAVERSEL---O---N---G version. This alpine climbing tale is at least partially true, only the names have been changed to protect the guilty. He wasn't really sure exactly when the whole concept of an alpine climb to the lofty and remote Western summit had first coalesced. It could have been on the trip up to reconnoiter the start of the somewhat controversial bolted route, yes, Tandar reflected, that was probably it. There was some anticipation that had built up over a period of months nay longer, it really was years. A washed out bridge had delayed the reconnoiter of the longest ""sport"" route in North America, and most would agree an unanticipated delay commonly results in a commensurate increase of unmitigated desire. America's failing and neglected infrastructure, damaged by the forces of nature, combined with monetary resources stretched woefully thin. Wars and banker bailouts were far more important or at least supported by advocates more diabolical and/or with deeper pockets. Somehow though after a seemingly interminable period the cumbersome bureaucracy had managed to push its way through and fix the broken bridge. So Tandar had finally headed East and taken the long and ever rough dirt road, parked the car and proceeded to walk up to find the trail and then the base of the now long anticipated climb. Being alone, as he unfortunately was so many times during these years prior to the internet bringing consistent and plentiful partners, he had resigned himself to just a recon on this first trip. Just locating the trailhead so it could be done in the dark, and soloing the first few pitches. Partly just to get some climbing in that day, but primarily in order to acquire a taste, to let the beast get its hooks firmly into him. And it did, it really really did. Even just the thought of it, twenty two pitches, nothing but bolts, a long and quick, maybe somewhat unaesthetic run for any climber that leaned more toward the trad end of the climbing spectrum as he did. But longer and higher had always been better in this climber's book. Ever since going from single pitch crags to the six pitches of Outer Space with a perm-a-grin affixed to a chalk smeared face. The higher the better, more exposure means more adrenaline. And ever since that natural drug had wrested priority from the external garbage that is foisted upon the youth of America, he had been on a more or less continual quest of actively searching it out. What better way to do so than out in the midst of mother nature's wildness? They say we have lived millions of years as hunter gatherers. We have been out in the wildness, exposed to and a part of nature for thousands of generations. You can not and should not deny that which is deeply ingrained into the human psyche, that which your very DNA are mapped out to and coincide with. The beautiful, vast, and untamed natural world. Maybe that's why he had for some number of years now, eschewed the hit and run, smash and grab, speed climbing style that had become somewhat prevalent in this day and age. The going ultra light car to car does have undeniably positive aspects, but it's still fairly easy to forget some of the pitches or even which pitch was led by whom. He had traded that need for speed for the slightly heavier, night under the stars total immersion multi-day carryover. The full meal deal, the complete and utter absorption into the natural element. Just like an alpine mountain route of greater distance and elevation, the drawn out passage of time spent in that world also carried a distinctively positive appeal. While the young guns have run back to the car, the city, the house, and the mundane of everyday life in their quest for speed, he is still out in the thick of it. Feeling the weather on his face, the rock under his hands and feet and all of mother nature's glory laid out before his gaze. Of course the inexorable crush of time may also have come to be factored into the alpine survival equation. At some point in the cycle of it's advancing age the human machine merely becomes incapable of extreme sustained speed. Or at least pushes into a danger zone if one foolishly attempts to continue down that path of racing with the ticking passage of time. But considering a tad bit longer term and a more sustained perspective it wasn't the long sport route that really and truly captivated his climbing imagination. No, in spite of the fact this climb was large, it resided on a much larger feature, a huge one to be exact. The Mount Garfield massif itself. The path made out of bolts was indeed big, bigger than any other, but it was dwarfed in comparison by the rock that contained it, and by the mountain group that encompassed all that rock. A long series of summits connected by rock ridges honed sharp by geological time. Rising up steeply on all sides, vertical in many places. Thousands of feet of sheer mind numbing alpine terror, breaking hard and dangerous out of the surrounding thick dark forest. The Garfield Group from the South, from 3000ft up the opposite valley mountainside For these were truly alpine diamonds in the rough. Found, conceived, and explored long ago but then inexplicably neglected, ignored, and discarded. Down and past the cold dark halls of an alpine lore long since forgotten. Hidden in the metaphorical rough of a perceived loose-and-dirty-rock-bushwack travail of uncertainty, danger, and undesirability. Cast away and abandoned for seventy some odd years. Waiting, biding their time to be re-reconnoitered, re-explored, re-discovered. Painstakingly researched, then measured cut and polished with great care, into the beautiful and true alpine gems that they really were. The best that they could be, the best that they had always secretly been. Maybe it sometimes takes a certain eye to see that which is hidden in this seemingly diabolical way by the dusty and rusty hinged doors of time? An eye that once might have rivaled a lightning strike has now at certain times been relegated down to a distinctly glacial crawl. A patient eye just looking long and carefully enough, taking the measure of time required to discern that there really is something there hidden in the literal and metaphorical mist. Something frozen, trapped... snared and constrained by time's long and bony fingers. Waiting to be broken from these cloying bonds, wanting and waiting to be released... to be set free. So somewhere along the way this climber's attention was shifted to the alpine objective. A much larger animal had brought him within it's sharp taloned grasp. The long sport route would have to wait until optimum weather, long days, and a reluctant partner coincided. He could solo only the first few pitches of bolts but it was possible the alpine choice would go completely within that mode of solitary ascent. Specifically the Western ridge culminating in the West summit of Garfield. For this was the first thing that struck the eye as you reached near the end of the rutted road. Briefly and tantalizingly peeking from the tops of the near all encompassing greenery of the valley floor.The Becky guide consulted showed a curious and maybe, from the more masochistic end of the alpine persuasion, a somewhat attractive set of circumstances. For this climb, and pretty much every other peak in the Garfield group, there was very little associated specific information. A quick internet search revealed not much more than that either. So it would be a voyage more of new discovery than many of the other climbs in the area, a beta-minimum or beta-min climb if you will, a challenge to re-discover the frontier of the unknown. West Garfield's West ridge, from the only visible spot on the approach road. While by strict definition the climb was not a first ascent, it had all the other characteristics of the same, a born again first ascent if you care to ponder long enough. The mystery of the unknown, taxing routefinding skills to the limit, finding the hidden path that avoids high danger and hopefully connects with summit success. Some excerpts from Becky included the description of Little Flat Top (a subsidiary summit just Northeast of the main Garfield summit), ""Details are lacking, probably one class-5 pitch"". Or the description of Courte Echelle (just North of Garfield main, the phrase meaning the maneuver of a climber standing on another's shoulders to reach a higher hold), ""History is uncertain, but a route has been reported...probably class 5."" And the description of this desired goal of the West ridge of Garfield West, ""Route details are unknown...extensive brushy scrambling should be expected...This will be a taxing workout."" Of course then, as anyone knows who has taken anything more than a cursory glance at this group of peaks, there is the primary descriptor presented by Becky. Garfield is the ""Hazardous Enigma"", maybe such a label applied by the consummate hardman himself should not be taken too lightly. So it was with some trepidation that the first foray into reconnoitering the West ridge climb was begun. ""Extensive brushy scrambling"" sounded sort of off-putting but the view of the ridge from the road did not look all that bad. It was the first week in June and there was still some snow on the summits especially on the North sides. That year the Middle Fork River road was closed just past the bridge due to a washout. But the start of the approach was very close to that point anyway so this was not really an issue. He started out just before dawn and was pleasantly surprised that most of the early part of the approach was relatively brush free open forest. The slope was steep from right off the road and did not relent until the first cliff band where there was a small open area at the top of a lower cliff band. He went out onto this cliff top and was rewarded with a closer unobstructed view of the climb ahead, including the ridge and one of the Western peaks. Little did he know this view would be the last before the base of the final cliff was reached. West Garfield's West ridge, from the only place on the approach that has an open view. He had some experience routefinding in deep forest but only for short distances, and this was on a considerably higher level of difficulty. Consider deep forests without a view to be akin to a permanent white out, with visibility never more than about a hundred feet or so. A green sea of cloud that never lifts, conspiring to befog and befuddle the sometimes unsuspecting aspiring alpinist. Throwing a wooden wrench into the gears of alpine puzzle solving machinery. And this approach involved several cliff bands that could only be navigated at specific points along them via fourth or easy fifth class climbing, the other sections being too steep loose and dirty to possibly surmount without gear. The surrounding forest meant that each cliff passage had to be located with minimum visibility. No easy general direction descent back to the road but a narrow specific path had to be followed to avoid the high levels of danger presented by these steep rocky escarpments. There were several places that had to be traversed to locate these passages, with some backtracking here and there involved. So with these losses of time it wasn't until near the designated turnaround time that the base of the final cliff was ultimately reached. Again there was a partial view but it was not anything as revealing as the first clearing had been. It was up against the base of the final cliff in a sort of shallow gully, both these factors limiting visibility. He could see the way ahead was steep and difficult but not anything vertical or as sheer as the foreshortening of the view from the valley floor implied. Having only packed for the day and knowing difficult route finding would slow the descent back to the road he decided to make this the high point of this trip. He knew he was close to the ridge top where the difficulties would change. The routefinding problems would ease as the climbing and exposure difficulties increased. It was also now apparent that retreat from further on the route would require rappels, also something that he had not geared up for on this reconnoiter. On the descent it soon became apparent just how difficult the forest routefinding could be. He had taken a few compass and altimeter readings, built some cairns and set out surveyors tape at key junctures, but these alpine tools afforded only limited assistance. Several times he had to backtrack and explore other avenues to find the specific places where the mossy cliffs could be safely descended. Temporarily lost more than once, and at one point even laboriously re-ascending a few hundred feet to find the one hidden passage that safely allowed egress. Sometimes in these types of scenarios he felt like he was tapping into the subconscious, the primal instinct to search and find the true path. Feeling and knowing the way ahead with a utilization of all the known senses and maybe some of the unknown. This first trip gave just a taste of what the climb might be like, for it was not really a serious attempt to gain the summits. Merely a reconnoiter to check the viability of this climb even being a practical possibility. And in that goal it was a success. He now knew there was a relatively quick and brush free way to gain the upper cliff band that led to the main ridge, and that that final cliff was steep but not an impossible barrier to that ridge. This was pretty encouraging and plans were laid for the next trip, with the thoughts of seriously tackling the technical terrain that lay ahead and that the summit might also now be within reach. Just a week later he again tackled the climb. The lower forest and cliff bands went well, this time he laid a more comprehensive trail of neon tape, knowing it might make a possible return less problematic. He quickly achieved the previous high point and had no problem committing to the first pitch of the upper cliff band, a mid fifth class affair involving a shallow and somewhat loose dihedral. But recent rains had left some of the rock wet, and combined with the moss he soon was in some slippery terrain. He managed to work past the cruxes of the first pitch and gained an upper gulley. The rock was smoother in this gulley and the wetness drove him to traverse into a treed area for more secure footing. He continued up through the trees of another gulley to finally gain the top of the ridge. The exposure then suddenly acquired a much greater and more frightening dimension. Above and away from the forest, with the openness of the ridge it was now possible to look to the very bottom of the mountain and it was a very long way down on both sides, the North side being equally steep to the way he had approached. He made his way up the ridge and the exposure only increased. The constant pressure building now as the day wore on. A little bit of tiredness tends to make the pressure seem to increase, a depletion of the body's resistance to the seemingly unending weight of facing danger head on. The view to the bottom became even clearer the higher he went, as the approach had been from a Southwesterly direction and now looking straight south and down it was nothing but sheer cliffs for thousands of feet. Here too the Northern aspect was no easier vista. The top of the ridge being only a few feet to inches wide in places, at some points just a sharp edge of rock with the abyss hugging tightly from both sides. Down close to the ground a ridge like this would be no problem, and it was only a moderate problem from the technical standpoint. It was the mental aspect that had become so very difficult. A sustained test of penultimate mind control, knowing that even the slightest mistake can lead to grim and unthinkable consequences. A patch of wet moss, a large loose rock, or for that matter even a small one. You take a gamble to a certain extent, the further you go on a ridge like this, the longer and consequently more dangerous the retreat becomes. The bodies energy is not unlimited, at some point you must rest, but in a place such as this there is no real rest, neither mental nor physical, only an enduring. A prolonged gamble in which the stakes of the unthinkable could not be higher. There are lines that should not be crossed because this is a game of survival and that more than any other facet of existence is so deeply ingrained as to be at some point totally irresistible. If man is just a meat android designed and constructed by higher beings in the chain then there is a primary directive burned deep into the core of the central processor. You must, you will...survive. And it was now apparent that this thing was much bigger than he had ever previously estimated. After making his way for a few hundred feet he was just barely approaching the first minor peak on the ridge, and this was less than a fourth of the way to the base of the first major one in a chain of four. It was clear now that this would be a two day climb and again he was not prepared. Maybe too it just didn't feel right, call it biorhythm or the phases of the moon. Whatever it was the proper climbing psyche necessary to carry on was beginning to fade. His mind commenced making excuses to call it quits, to turn around and come back another day, better prepared, in dryer conditions. The first minor peak rose ahead on the ridge and as he made it to the base of this looming feature it became obvious that it was time to cash in the day's chips. This might go against the grain of a mind more aligned to the desire to accomplish an established goal, deeply invested in the need to win. But it can't be at all costs and the stakes had become so very high. The steep start of this sub peak was also wet in places so everything came together and the choice became retreat, it had to be. Maybe too in the back of the mind he knew, for he had already thought of climbing over and down the other side, yet this time he had left a lot of tape behind on the potential retreat. Maybe a subconscious admission that he knew it wasn't going to go on this try. The down climb of the ridge to it's access point was just as difficult as climbing it maybe more so. He made it back to the notch where he had gained the ridge and proceeded down the three pitch cliff, making a few rappels along the way. One of the anchors was a small evergreen but it was in good shape with a moderate sized trunk. Maybe eighteen inches tall and about an inch and a half at the base. Familiarity with the local greenery had brought him the trust that it takes to rap off something this diminutive in size. The descent through the forest went without incident even though it was still somewhat tedious to find the exact route down through the cliffs. Now you may be thinking at this point that this project was becoming an affair without reward, but that is not entirely the truth. The main problem was he had underestimated the depth and breadth of this climb. Specifically that it was much longer than he had anticipated, both geologically and chronologically. So all the effort up until now was essentially just to gain the information necessary to complete the climb. Maybe it was sort of like the rock soloist first climbing a pitch that is at his maximum difficulty level. He climbs up a few moves at a time and then down-climbs, then he climbs again to another high point and down-climbs again, repeating these actions until he makes the top. This is to prove to himself he can retreat safely from anywhere on the climb. But it was also now obvious that this would not be an out and back affair. It was going to be up the hard way and down a hopefully easier side. Therefore it was a little different than a soloist on a single pitch. Because at some point somewhere past the halfway distance it was safer to commit to the unknown that was ahead than to try and downclimb such a long and dangerous ascent. In the next few weeks he tried to get any one of his close regular partners to go along on the next attempt, but his efforts were fruitless. Either because of the all too common schedule conflicts or just because not everyone is all that interested in this type of alpine adventure suffering. In the interim before his next attempt he did some generic multi-pitch rock with his regular partners. The typical classics for which there is no shortage of beta. These climbs while enjoyable did not have quiet the same attraction as in times past. No, now that this special climb had it's hooks in him there would be no complete satisfaction until it was accomplished. West Garfield's West ridge, from the South across the river. So Tandar set off alone once again, again more prepared both mentally and logistically from the time previous. All the prior attempts building on the knowledge necessary to garner success. Everything went according to plan up to his previous high point, and very smoothly and in shorter time than any of the previous attempts. Here he was faced with the first minor peak on the ridge. While the direct crest of the ridge looked possible it also looked more difficult than any previous climbing on the route, it at least justified looking for an easier path. The north side was out, nothing but a smooth blank slab, so he traversed out on the south face where it looked easier, but the rock quality turned suspect. He was faced with some easy moves but it mandated climbing over a large detached block. Sometimes there is just no going around a particular loose feature such as this, you have to climb over it. You say a little prayer maybe and then commit. Trying to will your body into lightness, and delicately moving upwards, trying to distribute your weight as evenly as possible with slow and careful motions, until you pass the offending threatening feature. Luckily he made it past this death block and continued up the small peak. The technical difficulty relented somewhat but the exposure only increased the higher he climbed. He reached the minor summit then started down-climbing it's other side. Again the difficulty escalated until he was forced around a side. This time the North side was good. He found a little ramp and made it to the next notch without incident. The notch was a beautiful little Japanese garden in the sky, so scarily remote and yet so comfortingly pristine. Small firs and pines, alpine heather, arranged among the rocks like you might imagine from the hand of some divine gardener. It was also the first flat bivy size spot he had seen since somewhere far below and halfway through the trees. While it was still too early in the climb to be of any practical use, it was a much appreciated rest from the continual exposure experienced up to this juncture. He had maintained a good pace up until now and it was about the time of day when he would occasionally take a power nap. Past a certain age you tend to do these sorts of things in order to try to somewhat compensate for the downhill path you are on. But being wound up from the adrenaline inducing climbing up to that point, any sort of nodding off was near impossible. He lay down in the heather but his mind refused to downshift enough to come close to the unconscious state. There is one potential pitfall with power napping though, and he had not yet discovered it at this point in life. That pitfall is that if you attempt a powernap and can't fall asleep you will be left in a slightly mentally impared state after the attempt, sort of a groggyness that takes a while to wear off. On the 3rd recon, looking East on the ridge from near the start. So he was unable drift into sleep, a seemingly innocuous occurrence at the time. He then proceeded to continue climbing in this unfortunate state of somewhat dulled senses. Again faced with a steep section on the crest toward the next summit, in hind-site he should have taken it straight on. A little harder technically but probably preferable to the generally loose conditions on the southern aspect. He traversed down onto the face and located a way that would lead over and upward. He was very exposed in this position, heels perched above the multi-thousand foot abyss, left hand on a nice jug of a ledge, he reached up directly above him to the next hold...and his whole world came suddenly and irrevocably crashing down. The large rock above him, a boulder of about 150 pounds and the size of a large watermelon, that he had reached up to grab and pull up on was in fact totally detached. Overhanging in it's position and held on by a hair-trigger connection to the face. He had pulled that trigger and in that short fraction of a second the whole climb was turned on its head. In his temporarily dazed state he had grabbed the rock without even looking at it. Violating one of the primary rules of climbing free solo, to always look before you touch. The boulder had come off with the mere breath of his hand. His lower hand was holding him onto the face above the abyss at the time, so no matter that his instincts were screaming to pull the hand back he could not let go because the other choice was much much worse. The rock crushed his thumb in an instant, pinched between the sharp edged hold that was keeping him on the face and the inertia of 150 pounds of jagged boulder falling from several feet above. It then crashed into his right hip, trying to throw him completely from his precarious perch above certain death. But this time his instincts won over and a very bad situation was not turned into the unthinkable. Lightning reflexes spurred by a maximum dose of adrenaline and the rock was sidestepped and went crashing down into the abyss alone, unable to drag down it's intended victim on it's gravity bound path towards destruction. You may ask what is the first thing to cross your mind in the immediate aftermath of a situation such as this, far out on this proverbial limb of deadly exposure and suddenly being unavoidably confronted with such an awful turn of circumstance? The first thing of course is having to face the damage, a proper assessment in order to decide on a plan of action, time of course being a critical factor also for it's not unlimited. The thumb is crushed to half of it's normal thickness, it's bleeding but not profusely, a gruesome site and one he can not bear to look at for long. A quick bandage is made out of a piece of a knit glove and the white tape that's always carried holds it in place. Quickly done in order to keep a clear head maybe? It goes without saying that to remain in mental control is a virtual necessity. The pain is not as bad as expected, not strictly debilitating it seems, although the question quickly becomes will he be able to climb with this compromised hand? Thought of rescue is contemplated, or at least to give a heads up, and the cell phone is brought out and an attempt to call his emergency contacts is made. But it's all for naught as this far up the remote valley the first bar doesn't even flicker. So that was how it was going to be, regardless of his position, he was on his own until if and when he could get back to the road. There was no rescue and in the next couple of days or so a front was coming in. So it would be self rescue or no rescue. 4 pins at 1 week With much trepidation he gathered his things and proceeded to carefully down-climb the ridge. Quite slowly at first until it was thankfully apparent that he had at least partial use of the damaged hand. He made several raps and after a long and nerve wracking period he was back down in the forest, where the exposure and constant pressure he had been under eased just a bit. He made his way down through the forest reflecting on what had happened and trying to brace his mind to face the coming doctor's diagnosis, for this could be a life changing event. While he tried to be optimistic it had looked like the thumb was damaged so badly that it would not be a very good recovery. Living in the USA means dealing with a health care system that is sometimes problematic and this case was no exception. But the end result was not that bad, at least better than had been expected and within a reasonable amount of time he was back to climbing normally. After this incident the interest in the climb waned for a certain period. Maybe it was the injury, or the lack of interest from his normal partners, but he just wasn't as excited as before about the prospects of getting it done. It was put to the back burner but maybe it was still simmering. A year went by and then two. In the interim he climbed many things but nothing that was as much of an unknown exploration, and maybe that is what finally drove him back. It was near the end one of the longest dry spells on record, and if you climb in the Northwest you know that you have to get while the getting is good, because the wet spells will be there before you know it. He again talked about the climb, to friends and in his mind. Then a partner bailed at the last minute on a day climb and he was in the area and decided to do some more reconnoitering. It was a spur of the moment chance sort of thing. He didn't have any of the collected reference material with him, not even a map. But fortune smiled on that day and he found the desired rocky ascent gulley of his planned descent and connected with a moderately easy forested ridge that stayed relatively brush free. He followed it up to near the expected descent point East of West Garfield. Sometimes in this process of hunting for these hidden gems it becomes apparent that some things are just meant to be. This is how it felt on this reconnoiter and it re-invigorated the interest he had felt so strongly before. And things had changed in the two years since the last attempt. The internet was finally coming into it's own as a place to connect with like minded individuals and in the last year he had done just that. Reliably hooking up with a number of great partners and having some pretty successful ascents that he really couldn't have done solo. Or at least it would have been more difficult and less enjoyable that way. Then one afternoon at a local gear shop he happened to come across a local climber who had done some pretty big first ascent traverse climbs. Just a chance first meeting but he decided to try and follow it up. The prospects seemed promising at first but it was a busy time at work for this individual and he couldn't get enough days off for what he thought this climb would require. His thoughts were that maybe this was bigger than it looked and it might be better to go at it well rested instead of straight from a hard work week. Perhaps this more experienced climber was correct in his assessment but with the beautiful weather Tandar desired to further this adventure even if it was not ultimately successful. And going with a partner would certainly carry greater potential than the previous solo attempts. No matter the outcome it would at least be more information gained. So he turned once again to the reliable climbing forum hook-up. Even this consumed another week of stellar weather before he could line up days off with the first qualified person who sounded interested. Ortan was the son of a climber and thus had started down this road at an early age. He had also done some difficult soloing and filmed and edited some impressive climbing videos. So it appeared that he could be an asset in more ways than one. Ultimately it all came together and there they were car-camping the night before at the trail-head with a quarter moon and clear skies for company. They both slept well and were up early and on the start before dawn. It had been two years so Tandar wasn't all that sure of the start. It was a relatively faint trail and two years of Northwest plant growth and blow-down were quickly conspiring to cover the puny efforts of man. The trail was lost early on, then they were sidetracked by cliffs and the obligatory wild hornets nests. After some hiking back and forth in the steep forest they found the trail again just as the sun's light first cracked the gloomily indistinct horizon. They followed the faint trail to the base of the first cliff passage and in spite of the two years hiatus they negotiated the one sure path in it's entirety to the base of the upper cliffs, and did so in a pretty good time. The first pitch out of the woods on the upper cliff that ends at the start of the ridge They roped up with the 50 meter twins they were carrying and, having been here before, Tandar shouldered the sparse alpine rack and took the first lead up to the base of the gulley and then the simul climbing lead up the couple of pitches to the ridge crest. The day was as clear as their prospects and they paused at this idyllic precipice to soak in the beautifully huge exposure that they knew would hold them captive until they had either completed this adventure of exploration or submitted to retreat. Looking ahead on the ridge the task appeared at points to be near impossible, but Tandar knew that up to this point it was mostly the optical illusion of fore-shortening. Additionally the steep sides of the visual profile to the North and South added to this impossibly sheer impression. Unbeknownst to our intrepid pair there was also another illusion at work, but this one lamentably applied it's affects in the opposite direction. For the climb ahead looked big but it would turn out in actuality to be even larger than first appearances. For while the ascent of every peak ahead was visible all the descents down the ridge from these peaks were hidden by the relative position on the crest, and all these descents were of course equal in distance to the total of the ascending terrain. Ortan quickly established his fearlessness by tackling the first set of difficulties on the ridge, possibly even surpassing Tandar's style on the previous efforts. Where Tandar had dropped down the sides to avoid the harder bits Ortan took them head on. Although the protection was at times difficult the crest of the ridge proved to have more solid brush free rock than either of the opposite faces. The two climbers soon discovered that in spite of the insurmountable appearance of some of the steeper sections that they would always turn out to be moderate once attempted. This continued to the first flat bivy spot, where a belay was set up in the small garden notch, as the gear had run out from the continuous simul climbing. The first minor peak on the ridge The second minor peak on the ridge Tandar was once again reminded of his previous travail as this was the scene of the unfortunate accident two years previous. He had intended to examine the location where the boulder had come loose on him but the undeniable attraction of the direct path up the center of the ridge was more appealing and the limited time frame afforded by the shorter fall days also precluded it. So the setbacks of the past were soon and gratefully forgotten, for a positive outcome in the here and now requires a similar mindset. There was a very nice looking knife edge section of the ridge ahead when it was Tandar's turn to lead again and emulating Ortan's example he took it straight on. This turned out to be the most physical part of all the technical climbing. For the wild exposure drove Tandar to attack this smooth edge with an ""Au Cheval"" technique, and the ridge was not much like horizontal at this point, it had an ascending angle. The smooth and un-featured sides turned this style into a half desperate attempt for traction in order to ascend. Sort of like an off-width in that it was not that difficult to maintain position but gaining ground was entirely an aerobically physical undertaking. At least there was no effort wasted stopping to place gear, for there was none available in this 25 foot long crux section. Following this knife edge section Ortan employed a slightly easier technique. He hand railed the edge with both feet smearing and body mostly on the left side, certainly less demanding physically but maybe more taxing from the mental aspect. Looking East at the 1st major peak on the W Ridge of W Garfield, another major peak behind. The Au Cheval pitch starts out from the notch on the left The two climbers steadily progressed along the exposed ridge as the day carried on. They climbed it entirely in simul fashion, only stopping for belays when the gear ran out. Most times they would use up the sixteen slings long before the seven cams as there were usually more trees than there were cracks. There was really no psychological or physical advantage to being second on the rope. The route had just as much down-climbing as ascending, so with the sparse gear the follower was just as routinely exposed to danger as the leader. Luckily for them on this day both of them had their lead heads together and there was never any hesitation to advance -under these oft times trying conditions. There are five minor peaks total in the Western group of Garfield peaks, all them centered around West Garfield. In the latter half of the day they finally summited on the Western most peak of this group, the first peak encountered when approaching from the West. The views were outstanding with the main peak of Garfield now showing itself in the near distance. They tried to identify their goal of Garfield West and at the time thought they had a positive fix on the correct peak. It was two peaks away from this first summit and it was starting to look like they were going to run out of time before making that summit. The climbing had not let up to this point and didn't look like it was going to until past the last peak of this group. In addition there were some smaller sub peaks between them and their goal on the ridge. Looking from the West, in order front to back, Garfield West, un-named peak, Infinite Bliss summit.

Garfield West summit from the West Garfield West summit from the West The sun was getting low in the sky when they summited on the next peak, just one peak away from their ultimate goal. The energy level of the pair was still high but the psychological pressure was starting to take it's toll. The goal was fast approaching but just as swift was the oncoming night and Tandar started reflexively looking for a way out of the omnipresent danger of the ridge that had been mandatory up to this position. He knew the topographic map showed an easier angled bench on the North side of the ridge. It didn't really start until after the West peak but they were near to that point and maybe it was within the topo elevation line's vague generalization. The down climb of the second peak was long and convoluted. Tandar followed a path laid out by the crest and then a parallel gulley on the North face. The latter was loose and dirty and consumed more precious time than it first appeared it would do. By the time they reached the next notch they were too close to running out of light to proceed any further. The decision was made to descend to the sloping bench below. Fate again showed favor and from the notch it appeared there was a potentially possible scramble down to safety via a steep loose gulley. It was a sad state of affairs to give up the desired goal so close to the summit, but surviving was more important. And they both felt they had done very well considering the circumstances. For the most obvious fact was that they, especially Tandar who was more involved with the planning, had underestimated the scope and breadth of this climb. But they had covered a large amount of exposed terrain during one of the shorter days of the late fall. They did not win their ultimate goal but still felt well accomplished with what they had survived and achieved. Pausing only long enough to sort the gear and coil the ropes they then proceeded to bail down the gulley, for they sorely needed to find a flat bivy spot for two before the concealing hand of the fast approaching night fell upon them. The terrain already covered did not hold too much promise for the way ahead, for there had been very few flat spots the entirety of the way since they had left the road so many hours ago. The sloping bench was just that, no area upon it appeared to be flat, but it was an easy enough angle for hiking with the occasional scrambling bit and they proceeded to traverse across it continuing in an Easterly direction.

Yet fate once again would smile upon them, for just as the curtain of darkness was finishing its descent they by chance happened upon a most idyllic spot as you possibly might imagine, and all the more advantageous for it's just as ideal timing. Halfway along and not too far down the sloping bench two graceful old growth evergreens had made a place nestled among a field of large talus boulders. For decades there laying down a flat bed of soft pine needles. Plenty of room for three or four and certainly palatial for two. The weary climbers had found a temporary home in this vast and remote wildness and they wasted no time in shedding their burdensome packs and lounging on the soft ground. It was a physical relaxation but maybe not so much a mental one. For they were only halfway along in this gauntlet of adventure and water was now becoming a concern. Earlier in the season there had been North facing snow for melting and they had carried a small stove and pot just for that purpose, but it was not to be. Although the bench had some damp places even bordering on marsh this only led to frustration, because there was not a spot of snow and no running water, not even a trickle. They had left the road with three quarts each thinking it would be enough to last and that they would find more, but the underestimated size of the climb had taken it's toll and they were down to only one quart between the two of them. Tree bivy on one of the very few flat spots Garfield Main and Garfield North Peaks, taken from the bench below the Infinite Bliss summit No water also meant they could not cook the freeze dried food they had carried and this combined with dehydration meant a limited performance on the next day. They lay down to rest with these thoughts weighing on their minds for they were out on a proverbial limb being this far from the road with so much steep ground in between. Knowing he would have trouble falling asleep anyway, Tandar stayed up for a while taking night pictures with the new camera he had brought on the trip. He had recently been inspired by some of the pictures on the forums and knew this place would have a special appeal if he could capture some halfway worthy images. Sunset from the bivy Starlight on the West Garfield Group, Seattle lights behind Stars through the trees Moon before dawn Moonlight on the Garfield West Group In the morning they woke up thirsty. They equally split their one quart of water and packed their gear and headed back up to the saddle of the ridge beyond the Infinite Bliss summit. The water was gone soon after that and it was not enough, for even by that time the previous exertions had built up a prodigious thirst. They were dehydrated already at this point and had much effort still ahead of them on this day. Tandar had originally planned to descend Southward from the ridge saddle between the Infinite Bliss summit and Leaning Spire. The sloping bench provided easy access to this saddle but the terrain on the Southern side presented quite a bit more difficulties. Tandar had reconnoitered a descent path from the road to within a 1000 feet of so of this saddle but it was that last 1000 feet that had remained a mystery until this point. And the revelation was not looking to be all that positive. First of all the ground was very steep with numerous vertical cliff bands. But worse than that was the floor of the forest. For it consisted of a very hard pack of evergreen needles. Very slippery and taking quite some effort for their light weight hikers to dig in a hold if it was even possible at all. The only saving grace was that each of them had brought an ice axe to provide a self belay. As Tandar had noted a similar necessity on some of the terrain covered during the recons. While the approach had very little of this slippery forest ground there had been some on the planned descent. But this was even worse. They started down and immediately were diverted by cliff bands and had to do some traversing. It was okay where there were branches and small trees to hold onto but the open ground was very sketchy even necessitating the chopping of small footholds at some places. You could even compare these different forest conditions to the different ways that any given snow slope affords traction. For while appearing the same as any other forest slope this one seemed singularly unique in it's slick hardness. Both the climbers agreed that aluminum crampons would be ideal and that it was like trying to climb alpine ice in sneakers without them. The path down past vertical cliffs was not obvious, nor was it certain how they would reliably connect with the route that Tandar had taken from the road, and the forest visibility here was the same as the approach, in other words strictly limited. So they wandered down a ways, going back and forth as much as dropping to find the way, and the conditions maybe even stepped up in difficulty, with the ground becoming even more steep and slippery. Then while on a particularly steep and treacherous section not too far above tall vertical cliffs the unthinkable occurred. Tandar was out in front a little ways and he suddenly heard Ortan give a frantic shout. ""FALLING!!!"" But they were not roped up and this was just a reflex reaction that would give no salvation. Ortan's less than optimum footwear had not too unpredictable lost its grip right as he was moving his axe further down the treacherous slope. He landed hard on his back and immediately started to slide towards near certain oblivion. ""ARREST!!!!"" But Ortan was thinking very quickly, his mind still not appreciably dulled by the oncoming dehydration and certainly strongly enhanced by a huge dose of adrenaline. Flipping over into the arrest position would take several fractions, maybe even whole seconds, and in that time speed would increase to the point of possibly loosing grip of the axe while attempting to arrest. For Ortan was using a leash-less technical ice tool and it's aggressive pick and leash-less design was not made for self arrest and would likely be torn from his grasp with the large shock load of the pick suddenly digging into the forest floor. No, Ortan was thinking very quickly, with lightning instincts in fact. He was sliding by and at some distance from a small but stout tree, not close to being within arm's length but possibly within the reach of a fully outstretched axe. He lunged for the tree with all the effort he could muster and just barely hooked his axe around the tree by it's base at the very limit of his reach. His speed was already considerable and the larger weight of his tall build was against him gathering momentum with that speed. In addition he was in no position and had no time to grab the axe with both hands. Could he hold on to the axe with one hand with no leash as his full weight and speed was suddenly and bone jarringly brought to a halt? Yes yes yes, Ortan was able to hold on, thank the climbing Gods yes. A lengthy and collective sigh of relief went out there somewhere down on the steep forested slope out in the still and quiet wildness. This near tragic event made it now very readily apparent that a shift in strategy was needed, or even more correctly demanded. For it was a long way down on similar and potentially worse ground and with the passing time and increasing dehydration things could only get worse, and this was already way too close to the edge of insanity. The immediacy of the moment demanded an answer and Ortan was the first to suggest, why not just rappel down Infinite Bliss? Sure it's set up for 60's and all we have is 50's but we'll just resign ourselves to rapping from single bolts if necessary. The Garfield Group from the South, the planned descent went down from the saddle in the middle. The Infinite Bliss summit is the 2nd from left Looking East, the sharp peaks are Leaning Spire, Garfield Main Behind, taken from the saddle between the Infinite Bliss summit and Leaning Spire There were times during the planning of some of the previous attempts that Tandar had considered using the rappel line of Infinite Bliss as a route of descent. With the right ropes and a topo it could make the return to the valley floor much easier. But in the specific preparations for this attempt the trad climber in Tandar had gained the upper hand, maybe subconsciously deciding that fair means did not include a retreat down an artificially bolted line. Or that walk offs were usually safer and preferable to long rappels. Hence the 50's that were lighter and of adequate length for the rest of the climb. For emergency purposes a topo of that route could have been helpful but maybe in the short notice preparations Tandar had merely forgot to include it. Now, facing the obvious demonstrated danger of this steep forested cliffs descent, it was totally apparent that the rappel, while still not easy and fraught with uncertainty, would be the better choice. So two tiring and increasingly dehydrated climbers laboriously made there way back up and over the saddle and back down onto the sloping bench. Here they traversed back West towards Infinite Bliss and were lucky enough to find a scramble gulley to access the ridge to the East of the summit. Gaining the ridge they were pleasantly surprised to find a most peaceful and serene alpine glade. A walk up affair in the midst of all the steep exposure. A temporary respite from the storm of danger, maybe in this case the eye of a hurricane. For sooner than not they would be forced back into the thick of it. Looking back on the alpine bench below the Infinite Bliss summit Looking up at the I.B. summit from the bench West Garfield from the I.B. summit. The North peak to the right The base of the summit block was soon gained and while the climb to the summit was not terribly difficult Tandar wanted to rope up, for they were carrying the gear anyway, it might as well be applied to bring safety. There had been some question as to which peak was really the summit of Infinite Bliss and although all the pertinent information had been collected there still was not any solid certainty that this was indeed what they were ascending. Ortan however soon removed all the nagging doubt when he found the chained anchors at the top of the climb and right near the summit. Another sigh of relief went out and they girded their minds for the coming commitment to the twenty two wandering rappels of some two and a half thousand feet in vertical distance. All this without any written reference, totally committed to the memory of some four or five years ago when the topo had been printed out and then set on the bookshelf for future reference. Not to mention the fact that the anchors were set up for 60's when they only had 50's. And that some of the pitches were reportedly very run out with virtually no natural gear between anchors, so the plan to rap from bolts between anchors when necessary was by no means a certainty. Ortan in spite of his little brush with death still had no lack of courage and he stepped up to take the first rappel without any prompting. The two climbers hearts now went into their throats and would not come out for quite some time. Ortan soon found a trail of bolts that led straight down to another chain anchor and happily it was within reach of their shorter ropes. He was quickly off rappel and Tandar was then on and soon down to join his fellow climber, now completely into the ragged jaws of whatever this full on descent would bring. The first rappel had gone well and now it was Tandar's turn to scout the way ahead. Committing to the Infinite Bliss raps, some of them are 60m. 22 pitches, 2500ft. With 50m ropes and no topo, nor having ever climbed it. The only knowledge being the faint memory from printing the topo 4 years before. Double even triple check all of the single links in the chain of gear in a rappel that is holding you above the abyss. Harness doubled back? Anchor good, knots okay, beaners locked, backup prusik correct? So many things for a dehydration addled mind to keep track of. Take a deep breath and you are off, sliding down a thin twin stranded lifeline. But Tandar's turn quickly took a decided turn for the worse. The first thing was there was no bolts? How curious, it was his recollection that all the top headwall pitches were thoroughly bolted, but this was not the case here on only the second pitch from the top? He tried traversing to the East, there was a large dihedral chimney and he seemed to remember a chimney pitch near the top in some of the TR's. Yes it was a large chimney, but still no bolts. He lowered further, committing to having to ascend the rope if he was mistaken, and still no trail of bolts. How could this be after the first rap had been so easy? He traversed back to the West but was limited in the distance he could clamber across the wall. For above him there was a slight bulge to the overall dimension of the wall between him and the upper anchor, and the rope had become trapped under the edge of a large flake that was on that bulge. Thinking now without any bolts below the anchor that maybe the pitch traversed in from the West side he called up to Ortan to ask if there was a line of bolts to the side. Yes was the answer. In the preoccupation with the safety of the gear they had neglected to at least glance in all directions for the evidence of the trail they were following. Tandar lowered further, for his traverse distance was limited by the rope caught in the flake above. There was another chimney way over toward the West, maybe it was the one described. He carefully scanned the rock all around looking for the telltale sign of stainless hangers, but there were none to be found. Lowering even further and after a third of an hour had passed from the departure from the last anchor Tandar gave a shout, ""ANCHORS!!!"" It was down near the bottom of the chimney, bolted chains again and a tiring climber cannot be more appreciative when he finds such a sight after so much tedious searching. Tandar clipped in and shouted up to Ortan, ""OFF RAPPEL!"". Here again they were somewhat slyly faced with death, although in their stupor it did not register on them in a strictly immediate fashion. The rope was still caught in the flake and Ortan gave it a modest tug in order to gain slack so he could affix his rappel device. When he did so all of Hades broke loose. Apparently this large flake was completely detached and the slight tug on the rope broke this four hundred pound chunk of jagged boulder free to take a shrieking ride down the powerful well of gravity. It bounced one time on the face below, broke into only slightly smaller chunks, and proceeded to whistle and scream off and down on it's vertical path of certain destruction. Five hundred feet of terminal velocity free fall before it smashed on the face well below the base of the headwall. ROCK ROCK ROCK FU*KING ROCK!!!!! the warning, and pray to the climbing Gods that there are no climbers below. Apparently the admonition not to get on this climb if there is a party above you was totally sound advice. Please if there is someone below now please let them be spared. It takes Tandar a few seconds or minutes to appreciate the gravity of what has just happened. He's out of the direct line of fire being West of the fall line and in a chimney. His first thought is are the ropes okay and Ortan answers yes. Then the addled mind finally clicks the relevant synapses together. A few minutes ago he was directly below that death block, monkeying around scrounging for the next anchor, yarding on the rope back and forth, never a hint of a thought that he was faced with his own imminent destruction. Learn this lesson here and now, watch carefully where the rope runs for your life can depend on that. He's known this for a long time, so now the dehydration's affects must be held in check for this is not a path that leads to any good outcome. Ortan comes down to the chimney anchor and another collective sigh in a now long chain of them goes out. They proceed down the headwall for another three or four pitches to it's base, the pitches ahead more straightforward than the terrible one they had just experienced. Making progress and seeing the way ahead they started to relax maybe just a little bit, after all they had come so far and were still relatively unscathed. But fate would soon again vex them, for unbeknownst to them the pitches below the headwall had no bolts between anchors and at some stations there were not even any bolted anchors at all. For this was the easy angled section of the wall and the first ascensionists either had lots of courage or lacked the funds necessary to bolt every inch of the climb. Looking up at the Infinite Bliss headwall from 1 pitch down the upper slab From Tandar's recollection they sort of knew that there were unbolted sections that had to be scrambled, but the memory was not clear enough to pinpoint exactly where they were located. This became sort of frightening because of the experience on the upper pitch and not being able to find a trail of bolts. One long rap down the slab below the base of the headwall, getting near the end of the rope and still no anchors in sight. A time consuming search of practically every inch of rock everywhere below them, not even one solitary bolt anywhere to be found. The slab is very blank, there are no trees or even bushes to speak of, only very small cracks here and there, mostly rotten and flaring, no good for even single placements much less something substantial enough to rappel from. Tandar resigns himself to sliding to the end of the rope, down to the limit, nothing below now but the yawning abyss. If there's no anchors here it's going to throw them into desperation. For they've looked to either side of this huge slab and it looks like you could possibly traverse on unprotectable ground, maybe over to steep forest but of course that has already been tried and it's not even close to an attractive alternative. But wait... what it this off to the side? Stretching the 50's now to the maximum... why it's another anchor, such a relief it's hard to believe. The shout is given and the sigh follows. It's a total stretch of the rope and Tandar leans down to just barely reach, but it does reach and he's soon anchored in, one more pitch down this giant face. Ortan soon joins him and then Ortan takes a turn on the lead and again reaches the end of the ropes having passed not one single bolt, but this time after long and fruitless searching there is no anchor to be found. The terrain is really unchanged, the whole slab is bereft of potential gear placements good enough to trust with your life. The only thing in this barren landscape that presents itself at this point is a single small and somewhat anemic looking cedar bush. Being that there is little other alternative left it's given a closer inspection. Low and behold at the base of it's thin and raggedy trunk there is some colored tat. Looking more closely there is even a small screw-link threaded through the tat. Someone before them has actually rapped off from this suspect piece of flotsam in this large sea of monolithic rock. The decision is made to commit for the alternatives are even less appealing, at some point you have to just release yourself into the hands of the climbing Gods. So another rappel is made, again a perplexing lack of even a single bolt, but this time the tree anchor reached at the end of the ropes is somewhat larger with more substantial runners and rings. Not what you would really expect though on a route that was supposed to be over-bolted to the nines. The look of these two anchors in a row makes them wonder if they are on some desperate bail line from some unfortunate party before them. Finally on the very next rappel some stainless hangers show themselves on the steepening face. The trail of hangers is followed down and leads to a double chain anchor, things seem to be looking up but then defeat again attempts to snatch them from the jaws of victory. For this time with the fat anchors in clear view the rope clearly does not reach. It really shouldn't be any surprise but the short ropes have finally come up lacking. Tandar however has some McGiver blood in him and where there's gear available there's usually some solution to a mechanical style predicament. He ties the quad runner to the end of the ropes and at full upside down extension he can just reach down and barely manage to clip into the anchor. Then after a few moves of tricky down climbing he is there. Ortan soon lowers down and after a similar cluster of a jury rigged system, joins him safely at the anchor. But their troubles are still far from over, they are only half way down this giant wall and at the next anchor Tandar drops a sling with two beaners. He dully watches it slowly picking up speed and departing downward. Somewhere along here in the middle of this vast wasteland of rock the dehydration starts to make itself more familiar, it comes closer with it's dry parching embrace. A tangible partner in this seemingly interminable dance with the destruction that's desperately being held at arms length. At least once and maybe twice Tandar forgets to clip into the anchors before taking his device off the ropes of the rappel above. While safely standing on a ledge this is still not even something that a clear headed climber would ever do. Then again fate decides to strike them another blow. Maybe she's pissed off that they've decided on this unaesthetic retreat and is giving them trial and tribulation in payment for shirking the hard way down? For now it's Ortan's turn and he temporarily succumbs to the lack of water and his mind briefly loses it's grip on the here and now. For they of course have gone light as practically possible and there is only one rappel device for each of them. Devices which are crucial to the descent when you are in the middle of a huge wall such as this. While standing on a ledge at yet another set of anchors in this long chain, he fumbles and drops this one crucial device. Desperately wishing they could somehow stop and reverse time they both watch it drop to the slab below them, please please stop on a small ledge, something, anything. Tink...tink.......tink....................tink..........................................tink. They sadly watch it depart down that ever present well of gravity, giving them little ringing metal notes as a last parting gesture, an audible symbol of their seeming futility. ""Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn..."" Ortan exclaims, ""how could I possibly let that happen?"" Of course all is not totally lost, for there is the Muenter hitch. That indispensable knot which every self sufficient climber who commits to any huge rappel should have in his quiver of knowledge. Ortan is young in his alpine experience only knowing of the knot but unaware of it's exact configuration. Luckily Tandar has tied it before although he's never had occasion to use it much, and it's been a while since he has bothered to practice this crucial bit of rope-craft. After a minute or or so he manages to tie the knot but then the now ever present slowness of mind pulls at him as he tries to relearn how to accomplish the pattern in a quick enough fashion to accommodate the numerous rappels they still have below them. Eventually Tandar is satisfied with the Muenter. It's agreed between the two of them that he will give his rappel device to Ortan, who is too unfamiliar with this knot rappel system to have any trust in it, least of all hang his very life on it. Looking closely though at the system Tandar realizes that the safety knots they've been tying in the rope ends will pass right through the Muenter setup with no resistance, which means there is no back up at the rope's end. So he subsequently employs a locking beaner on his backup prusik to ensure that it keeps him from sliding off the ends of the rope. They've come so far at this point that it would be ludicrous to not employ every means within their ability to stay alive until safety is finally reached. They carefully pass the single remaining rappel device left between them for Ortan to use and Tandar again heads down. Another rappel passes and another. One wish they have had for a while now is that there might be some climbers heading up this popular route. For below them the vague memory indicates there are tricky scramble traverse sections to negotiate and some full 60 meter rappels that no amount of monkeying around with slings is going to bypass. For if climbers were coming up they would have the necessary 60 meter ropes and of course a topo and more familiarity of the route having just climbed up it. But it was now a seeming impossibility. For the day was far more than half gone and if anyone was coming up they surely would have turned tail by now. For their pace would be well short of making the climb in the normal long day that it required. At some time in any big adventure there is a moment where the proverbial point of the light at end of the tunnel is reached. And since the dear reader is in fact now digesting these words it should be somewhat apparent that this great adventure did at long last finally get to that now long strived for place. Hopefully also without ever being visited by the pretty much continual threat of mayhem or even worse, the tragic and untimely end of either of our two intrepid protagonists. Looking down they now saw a stunningly unbelievable sight, for there were two climbers coming up the route. The two Coast Guard climbers we met about 1/2 way who where coming up the route That metaphorical unbreakable tech cord noose they had worn for this long time sort of now eased it's grip just a bit. The seemingly impossible now magically transformed into the distinctly possible. For while they most likely would have made it to the bottom without help who knows how long it would have taken and how much more grief they would have had to endure? These climbers had 60's of course, and an extra rap device, and a topo, and a small amount of water with knowledge of where the nearest plentiful water was. Two regulars in the Coast Guard, on a mission and they didn't even know it. The solitude of wildness is fine but there are circumstances where it's so nice just to meet and talk to other humans and this was one of those times. They exchanged stories and explained that they were only going halfway which would make sense since it was such a late hour. Ortan and Tandar continued down knowing these climbers would be close behind them as the halfway point was only one pitch above. Two pitches below this point they again tangled with a rappel of greater length than their ropes would allow. While they fiddled around trying to get an anchor in the un-fractured rock their new found friends joined them on the descent. Of course Ortan and Tandar agreed with the rope situation that they would all go down together on the 60 meter ropes. Knowing that with the ever present loose rock that this would be the safer option. Three rappels later they all reached that small green oasis part way up the wall. Water The planet and man's life blood. Unless you think you might want to go try and live on Mars. Normally taken for granted until you get stuck on a big alpine climb too late in the season to find any snow. By dusk they had hit the ground. Tandar coiled a rope and packed his things. Then while waiting for the others he carefully took the sharp Swiss steel from his pocket and slowly cut the tech cord noose from around his neck. He then cut it in two and tied it to his harness. You never know, it might be useful as a prusik, or leaver cord, or just as a memento of some alpine lore long forgotten. FIN (post script.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/liberty-cap-beating-1-liberty-ridge/783262,Liberty Cap Beating #1: Liberty Ridge,2011-07-17,"July 15-18, 2011Mt Rainier - Liberty Ridge (III-IV, 55 degree snow/ice, AI2/WI2) This July I climbed Liberty Ridge on Mt Rainier with Eric, a local Washington climber that I had met on CascadeClimbers.com. Despite having great weather in late June, the Pacific Northwest was suffering from lingering winter weather in mid-July, and winter conditions persisted on many routes in the Cascades. Since I was only in town for two weeks, I was willing to put up with a mediocre forecast in order to get up on the route and hopefully catch a weather window. Though we had originally planned to do the climb Thursday-Saturday, the NOAA point forecast got us to shift the climb to Friday-Sunday so that we'd have the best weather on Sunday. Friday morning the forecast called for a good chance of rain & snow the first two days, and ""Mostly Sunny"" for Sunday and beyond. Two days of putting up with rain & snow until weather cleared or we popped above the clouds seemed an all right price to pay to catch the weather window Sunday. To be safe, we would also carry enough food & fuel for 5 days for the 3 day climb in case weather delayed us on the climb. We also brought a GPS with pre-recorded waypoints for the approach, climb, and descent. This proved valuable on the climb. Friday - The Weather Ain't That Bad!Despite the 'bad' forecast, it was actually pretty clear on Mt Rainier. Little Tahoma Pk We had nice views of the lower mountain on the approach to lower Curtis Camp, and visibility was not a problem on the Winthrop Glacier. The only source of moisture on our gear was from perspiration this day as it felt hot & humid. We made camp at about 7,400' on lower Curtis Ridge and enjoyed some rock slabs that were perfect for lounging and taking in the views. Since we expected it to be cloudy that night, I decided to make use of the weight of the DSLR I hauled in and took artsy photos of the Carbon Glacier. As the evening wore on the clouds parted and we were fortunate enough to get a clear view of the north side of Mt Rainier. Considering the forecast, I had been prepared to miss out on this, so it was a great surprise! Thar She Blows! Saturday - Should We Keep Climbing? We woke to the soft pitter-patter of rain on the tent walls. Time to get wet. We started climbing under a light rain, but fortunately I never needed to use the waypoints I had put into my GPS. Clouds were either below us or above us the entire time, so visibility was fine on the Carbon Glacier. Rain turned to snow as we neared the toe. We had hoped to take the direct variation to Thumb Rock on the west side, but we couldn't find a way through the crevasses and were forced to endure about a pitch of unprotectable skice and slush mixed into a vertical gravel slurry to gain the toe from the east. Fortunately as we wrapped around the sketch factor decreased, though for about half of the ascent we had shallow snow mixed in with the loose rock. As we neared Thumb Rock I came across one chute that was dribbling out rocks every minute or so. I made sure to sprint across this section! We made it to Thumb Rock a little later than hoped, but still plenty early in the day. We napped and managed to get our clothes dried during the sunny intervals as the tide of clouds washed in over Mt Rainier, and then receded, over and over again. The WI3 Center Variation Above Thumb Rock Camp. Willi't Kill You' Wall Provided Good Background Noise for Our Camp The plan for the next day was to start climbing by 3am to get us over the Cap and down to the TH at a respectable hour, but when Eric checked the updated forecast on his phone, he saw that our ""Mostly Sunny"" weather window had changed to ""80% chance of snow, 1-3"" @ 13k'"". Yikes! We were tempted to pack up camp then and there and just keep climbing while it was still clear and sunny, but we were tired, relaxed, and decided that since the weather was forecast to move in later in the morning, we'd wake at midnight and be climbing shortly after 1am to beat the weather. Sunday - We Should Have Kept Climbing Climbing was great under a bright moon, and although we climbed in darkness, we had nice views of Seattle and the north side of Mt Rainier as we ascended. As we got higher we encountered more early-season conditions as the hard neve/ice often had a layer of fresh snow on top. Sometimes we could crampon, but often we were kicking steps calf deep and sometimes knee deep in the snow to make steps or reach purchase in the ice beneath. This was hard work and slowed our ascent more than expected. We took turns breaking trail, swinging leads about 6 times on the route. The weather was still clear as the sun rose shortly after we rounded the Black Pyramid to ascend the slopes above Willis Wall. I took my sole climbing picture of the day then, as by the time we reached the top of the Black Pyramid, the storm had already broken. Eric Nearing the Top of the Black Pyramid Me following below the top of the Black Pyramid at sunrise. Storm arrival t-minus 1 hour. We moved at a snail's pace as we tired from the elevation and soft snow, but the snow kept getting softer and deeper. As I traversed over to the bergschrund crux, I was often digging through waist deep snow, right up to the ice pitch. By this time it was snowing hard and the wind was blowing around 30-40 mph. The ice pitch had a continual dumping of windblown snow that was sluffing off the slopes above. I got thoroughly drenched from these pervasive ice crystals as I climbed 1 pitch of ice through the whiteout, stopping every time snow poured down on me to brace myself and cinch up my hood. This pitch normally would have been pretty easy but conditions definitely added to the stress factor! Eric took the next trailbreaking lead and found another nice pitch of sustained 40 degree ice. Though exhausted at this point, I welcomed the ice for the break it provided from the soft snow. Plus it was fun! I finished another pitch of ice to the top of the route. Unfortunately here the wind gusts picked up and visibility dropped to near zero. We had difficulty reaching the top of the Cap as a large bergschrund stopped us less than 100 ft from the top. Going left, it grew larger, so we backtracked to the right and end-ran it and were shortly on top of Liberty Cap. The problem at this point was that we could barely see the snow 1 or 2 steps in front of us. Despite having our waypoints for descent set in the GPS, that only helped us for the larger scale routefinding. We realized that we could easily walk off a cliff or into a crevasse with the visibility as bad as it was. We were both thoroughly soaked and becoming mildly hypothermic. I was covered in rime ice, already had the ""umbles"" and was beginning to get the ""stumbles"" and both Eric and I had been shivering non-stop for the past 3 or 4 hours. The last forecast we had seen showed the weather to dissipate Monday, so we decided it was best to set up shelter on the Cap to get warm & rested, and attempt to descend once visibility improved a bit more. We dug a platform into the bergschrund wall that we had end-run and I built up some hardy wind walls. Despite the howling wind, the BD First Light we were using was pretty calm, and our biggest complaint was being buried from snow drifting over our tent. Eric took initiative and shoveled snow off the tent a couple of times throughout the night. Everything in our packs was saturated, including our sleeping bags. Luckily neither of us was using down loft! We melted more water and spent the night gradually rewarming as we slept in our soggy bags and clothes. Monday - The Sorry Soggy Slog The First Light survived the storm! Rime covered snow pole. Hooray! We could now see about 20-50 feet! We were up early, packed up camp, and began navigating to our waypoints to bypass the Columbia Crest and GET DOWN. It felt like we were going pretty slow, but we actually made pretty decent time through the 50 mph gusts and whiteout as we found the right way off the Cap and around the Crest. There was still tension in the air as we climbed, as all of the fresh windblown snow hid the crevasses pretty well. I punched into two as we descended the Cap. The first one was large enough that I stopped my fall by hooking the far side with my tool and stemming my legs. I ratcheted back up, rolled onto the near edge, then jumped across to keep up the pace. Barely a setback at this point. Still covered in rime and annoyed as I climbed out of my second and smaller punch-in. I got much more thorough with my pole probing after this. We did get held up briefly in the seracs atop the Winthrop Glacier, as apparently you can't traverse straight over to the Emmons from the height of the saddle connecting the Cap & Crest (oops). For future reference, you still need to ascend a couple hundred feet up the Crest to bypass the seracs & 'schrund before dropping back town towards the Emmons Glacier. Gradually the skies cleared and we found the Emmons Glacier wands. I put away the GPS, put my brain into autopilot mode (with the crevasse-search feature still engaged), and at last began a relaxed descent. I finally stopped shivering as we got more sunshine through the blowing clouds. Sadly the Inter-Glacier was too slushy for any real glissading, but we made good time rushing down the trail as thoughts of Doritos and beer in the car kept me at a steady 3mph clip. Despite being thoroughly trashed, I headed back to Mt Rainier the following weekend to climb Ptarmigan Ridge, a longer, harder, and arguably more classic route than Liberty Ridge. The weather forecast was much better for this climb, but Liberty Cap wasn't done with me yet. Notes Gear Notes We brought 4 screws & 2 pickets between us. This was more than sufficient. Approach Notes The Carbon Glacier was getting more broken up when we crossed it. We had to do a large end run to the far west side of the glacier at the beginning, and we couldn't find a route around the toe of Liberty Ridge. The rock on Liberty Ridge's toe was very melted out and best avoided if possible. It was some of the most dangerously loose rock I have ever climbed. Rocks were also falling off the ridge crest regularly just below Thumb Rock.

Some of your decisions, which you openly admit to but don't seem to see any problem with, are far from the best ones. I think your experience in more ""extreme"" mountaineering has left you with an overconfidence and a skewed sense of risk assessment. This shows in what mrchad pointed out in your 2010 Shasta report when you stated that you didn't feel you had anything to learn since you did everything right, and then there's this little gem: ""There are some valuable lessons for other climbers to learn from the tragedy as well – the decisions I made that got me down the mountain alive."" How about lessons on when to turn back (even if it's before you summit)? When to realize that the weather might come earlier than you expected? When to decide, ""Maybe I shouldn't be doing this in the first place, too many unknowns""? mrchad is totally right, you are arrogant and have too much confidence in your superiority over mother nature. This is why people think mountaineering is unreasonably risky and dangerous, because people like you often make bad decisions which put you and your partners at risk edit: also if you are going to flaunt with epics, do it in your own mountains. We already have enough people needing rescue around here each and every year PellucidWombat - Jun 3, 2013 2:32 am - Hasn't voted Re: Reading more of these... ""This is why people think mountaineering is unreasonably risky and dangerous"" Well there we go, this is the point where we can agree to disagree, and on this point I can't/won't argue with you because it is a personal decision on what risks are worth doing, and what risks are careless versus being reasonably prepared and living life. At this level, I can only say each of us is entitled to our own opinions and I can't judge you deciding it is too risky to do much mountaineering. It is risky, and you can't rule out risk, only be prepared to mitigate it and still even then, take a change. My attitude is you do that in many other ways that you don't elevate to the same level as something as 'flashy' as climbing, and the rewards I get out of it are worth the price. I have probably had as many (or more) near death encounters on my road bike than in the mountains from careless drivers (I almost got T-boned last week when I had the right-of-way). In fact, the closest I personally came to dying, related to a climb, was DRIVING back from Mt Shasta when a car was driving the wrong way on the freeway, straddling both lane lines. Good thing I wasn't dabbling on my smart phone on that straightaway, or otherwise distracted while driving . . . If we were overconfident about Liberty Ridge than we would have only brought supplies for the 3 days we expected to climb it in. We expected the possibility of a storm hitting us high on the mountain, even with a good forecast, and prepared for it. The weather forecast changed drastically after we had left (which is common, and we were prepared for, hence 5 days' provisions for a 3-day climb, and a good GPS with waypoints previous marked), and us knowing about it was an unexpected (and very modern) convenience. We were high enough on the route that it was debatable whether bailing was safer than pushing up and over and leaving sooner to get through the worst before the weather broke. I really don't see how you think we were overconfident in that once we saw that we were beginning to get hypothermic, and that a GPS track wasn't sufficient for safe travel in the storm, we decided to stop while still in control, warm up, hydrate, eat, rest, and wait until conditions were safer to travel (knowing that no system was heading our way, just lots of regional instability in the forecast - as per the NOAA forecast discussion). We stopped while in control, got better, and as soon as conditions were safer to travel, we navigated down the whiteout without incident. I can point out many many ways this could have gone badly, but didn't, if had not been prepared or charged ahead once things got bad. ANAM is full of them and we were fully aware of what has happened before. ""also if you are going to flaunt with epics, do it in your own mountains. We already have enough people needing rescue around here each and every year"" Yeah, you really showed how closely you looked at these reports about us outsiders in 'your' mountains. Tom was from Vancouver, Nastia was from Portland, and Eric was from Olympia you jackass. And what exactly are 'my' mountains? I'm not arrogant. I've personally had a number of acquaintances and friends maimed or killed in the mountains over the past 6 years (NOT with me, as Chad would claim), and every one makes the dangers that much more salient, but I don't pine about it online to an audience. But perhaps I come across as arrogant because I don't give respect to POS like you. If you really cared in talking on a sincere level, I am just a PM away, and you can start by directly asking me questions in a constructive or clarifying way, and not throwing prior judgments and accusations at me from incomplete or vague information. I have had many such conversations with people in PMs or in person and I HAVE adjusted either how I do things, or how I view things, after having such discussions. One small example is even though it wouldn't have helped Tom, I was convinced to put in the time and money to get trained and certified as a Wilderness First Responder, as this can make such a huge difference on any outing in the backcountry or high on a rock wall - and I intend to keep up with my certification. I show much more humility and genuine feelings and doubts to those people because they approached me with respect and as a decent human beings - there no need to launch into public attacks with half-assed accusations that show your lack of sensitivity. In those cases I am not inclined to talk to you respectfully, openly, or seriously. That's not arrogance, that is just weeding out all of the obvious BS. pchernik - Apr 5, 2014 6:23 pm - Hasn't voted Thanks Thanks for the great trip report! Viewing: 1-5 of 5 to post!

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/serpentine-arete/524999,Serpentine Arete,2009-06-26,"Bad Weather Down SouthAs with so many other trips, plans for the serpentine arete started out with other plans. The original plan was to climb Rainier, but bad weather down south made me reconsider the idea of sitting around in a tent for a whole weekend waiting for weather to clear up. So the plan changes and Dragontail peak became the peak of choice! Next, Chico, Colin and I had to decide if we were going to climb it in one day or two. We decided to arrive at the Leavenworth ranger station at 7:45 to see if we could get permits for Colchuck lake by the lottery. The plan was to climb in two days if we could get permits, one if the permits weren't available. Thankfully there were only two groups there in the morning, the other group got permits to camp in the Enchantments to climb Prusik. With permits in hand, we had a whole day to do whatever we wanted. After getting a quick breakfast, we headed over to Castle Rock to climb it from bottom to top as a warm up for the climb the following day. I don't know what route we climbed on the lower half (and I forgot my camera in the car so I don't have any pictures) but Chico had never climbed on Castle Rock so we send him up Canary for the second two pitches. After relaxing at the top for an while, we got back to the car and drove to the trailhead and started packing. Thursday Afternoon and NightIn packing all our gear, we were faced with the important decision of what rope system to bring. I said we should just bring one rope and have the two followers tie in 20-30' apart. But Colin insisted on having two ropes for the crux pitches so we brought one 9.8 mm single and another 9.1 mm single for the crux pitches. With all our gear packed and ready to go, we sped off up the trail toward Colchuck Lake. This trail always seems to take a lot longer than it should, and it was no exception this time around. dragontail But we eventually made it to the lake and found a campsite on a boulder just off the lake. first good view or the mountian camp The camp was a bit windy but proved to be fine after building a few rock walls around our bivy sacks. Speaking of bivy sacks, I packed two in the trunk and was going to decide which one to take when I packed at the trailhead... I forgot both of them and used a garbage bag and my rain jacket, oops! Anyway, clouds rolled in and started covering the tops of the peaks. Being the I had no protection for my down sleeping bag, I searched around and found every possible boulder to sleep under in case it rained. The clouds made Dragontail look very forbidding in the fading evening light. We went to bed around 9:00 (I hadn't done that for years). Thankfully the clouds didn't stick around very long as I woke up around 11:30 to a sky full of stars, not a cloud in sight. This is when I discovered that my sleeping pad had a hole in it and lost all its air. I spent the rest of the night sleeping on a flat pad on rock and somehow slept just fine. FridayAt 4:30 I was awakened by the sound of shifting boulders to see Colin snapping pictures of the sunlight starting to peer over the horizon. We were going to sleep until 5:30, but figured that since we were already up we might as well just go for it. We were hiking away from camp at 5:30 sharp. Chico hiking toward the moraine We took our time hiking up the boulder field below the moraine and stopped to drink and fill our water bottles right where the stream left the snowfield at the top of the moraine. The morning light was beautiful and we were excited to have perfect climbing weather, cool and cloudless. Colchuck stood above us shining in the morning sun. Colchuck The hike up the moraine was uneventful and we were quickly at a short section of snow, about 150', between us and access to the rock. Colin and I brought aluminum crampons to go with our running shoes and Chico skipped the crampons and brought his boots. We opted to chop steps for this section as the rock was so close, this worked out wonderful and was quite efficient. Before we knew it we were sitting at the base of the climb sorting the rack which got mangled in the pack. We took out time preparing for the climb, laughing and relaxing in the cool morning air, until we saw another party heading up the moraine! We found out they were also planning on climbing the Serpentine Arete so we got our act together and headed off for the first pitch through the lower ledges. Chico took these first few leads as his is an expert at climbing loose and undesirable rock. He managed to find a solid and fun (low 5th class) route through the lower ledges and in two long pitches we were below the left facing flake system leading to the crux pillar pitches. Chico led the flakes, which ended up being a bit icy, which proved to be fun climbing. At the top of this pitch Colin and I moved the belay around the corner to get ready for the crux. Chico working up the ledges Colin belaying Chico after moving the belay to just below the flakes Chico leading the flakes Colin took the lead for the next three pitches. I was originally going to lead this pitch and colin the next two, but with the other team right on our tails we wanted to waste no time switching gear back and forth... speed was more important now! Colin decided to take the crack system right of the flaring finger crack and led the pitch with ease. setting the first piece and examining the flaring finger crack in the far right crack system For this pitch and the two above it we used two ropes (trailed one for a third climber) to allow for full belays on both climbers. This was a great choice for picture taking as I wasn't worried about being belayed on the same rope as the person climbing below or above me. Chico and I climbed quickly, enjoying the clear granite, especially the short handcrack right below the belay. looking down at Chico while climbing the handcrack Chico finishing the handcrack The next pitch was more solid granite. Colin led into the shallow dihedral and tried stemming to make the thin climbing easier. Unfortunately for Colin, his rock shoes were old and had no rubber under the toes which made the polished rock even slicker. For a few seconds Chico and I watched Colin run on a vertical treadmill scratching for something to hold onto. It was a few tense moments but he made it through without falling. After a few minutes of belaying Chico and I were climbing the solid pitch and enjoying the surrounding scenery. Chico just above the thin dihedral I found the flaring dihedral extremely fun as I stayed in the corner and found excellent finger jams the whole way. At the top of this pitch we looked down to the glacier to see a party ascending it, they sure looked real small and we were only a third of the route up! Anyway, Colin led out one more time and quickly called ""off belay!"" after stretching the rope to almost it's full length. This pitch was annoying to me because it started with a flaring slot which game me more problems than anything else on the climb! But Chico and I both grunted up the slot and gained much easier ground above. The pitch ended right on the crest of the ridge and in the sun... all day we had been in the shade and cold, finally we could take off our jackets (only to put them back on because the wind picked up). the flaring slot! Colin in the sun at the belay atop pitch 7 Since I didn't get to lead any of the crux pitches they told me I could lead until I got sick of the loose terrain above. We switched back to a single rope which we shortened to a little over half length to lessen rope drag while simulclimbing. After taking the rack I set out on what was going to be a LONG pitch. But at a rope length and a half I ran into an almost vertical crack that shot up and right for about 25'. I put a piece in and started up it. Right away I realized the climbing was too thin to just simulclimb but figured I could get above it and set a belay to get Colin and Chico thought it. But 2/3 the way up the crack stopped accepting pro as it was too flared and the feet disappeared. The moves to get to easier ground felt like 5.9 so I backed off after one move and downclimbed back to a ledge where I set up a belay and took in the rope. just after leaving the belay Looking down from just below the angled crack I backed off of Colchuck Peak After belaying in the other two I explored an option to the left of the crack (which had looked impossible from below). It turns out that going left was nothing more than 4th class or low 5th class terrain. We were quickly climbing together again. About 2 rope-lengths later there was another step that was around 5.7. I climbed this and set a belay at the top, again ending the pitch much earlier than I had hoped. From this belay we climbed up through some east 4th class terrain and came to a decision, to go right of the imposing tower or strait up it! Strait up the tower looked tough so I opted for right, that is until I found going around to the right led strait in to loose and steep choss. I took a gully up the tower which had some fun climbing and topped out on an exposed and thin ridge. After crossing the ridge I came to a 20' drop of a smooth and almost vertical slab. I backtracked and downclimbed to get around this section but ran into loose and hollowing sounding rock, not the most fun thing to downclimb. As soon as I could I set a belay with the two last pieces I had and brought Colin and Chico up. This pitch was a good 400' long. At this belay station we looked up and saw what we thought was the summit. But we quickly persuaded ourselves it wasn't as every trip report we read said the summit never seemed to come since the upper 2/3 of the ridge was so long. I told Chico that I would lead out on this pitch and he could take us to the summit from there. This pitch started out with another decision, to the right or left of another imposing tower. I chose to check out the left option this time. After cresting the ridge I was surprised to be looking down on the fin! Apparently what we though was the summit really was the summit! looking back on an easy 3rd class traverse just below the summit I excitedly shouted the good next and led off toward the summit. I looked for the 5.7 finish to the summit block but was enticed by an airy chimney. The chimney proved to be fun climbing on hollow sounding rock. In no time at all I was belaying Colin and Chico off the summit horn! It was 3:30. summit obligatory summit shot obligatory summit shot As Colin and Chico arrived we realized we hadn't seen or head the other rope team that was behind us since the flaring slot above the second crux pitch. We had began to wonder if they had decided to turn around (but couldn't come up with any good reason as to why they would be that). We enjoyed the views from the summit, took pictures, ate and relaxed. About 35 minutes later we head voices and saw the other rope team. Somehow, our team of 3 had pulled way ahead of them on the upper ridge. It was good to know they were ok. And, if either of you two are reading this, it was our pleasure to be climbing with you two for most of the ridge, you were great company! Their trip report is here After talking to the other two and relaxing a bit more, we packed out gear and started scrambling down to the snowfield which would lead us to Aasgard pass. The descent proved to be very simple. Colin and Chico enjoyed a nice glissade down to the small lakelet at the top of Aasgard pass and I plunge stepped my way down opting to keep my pants dry. And what is there to say about descending the pass itself... lots of knee jarring boulder hoping goodness. Colin went down the middle and got cliffed out just before the lower slopes and had to make a rappel to gain easier ground. Other than that it was an easy trip back to camp! scrambling down from the summit to the snowfield Looking back on the snowfield Looking down Aasgard pass north face of Dragontail At camp we took our time packing and started hiking out. We stopped once to get one last look at the mountain and our route. one last look From the end of the lake, we stopped talking and went into ""get to the car"" mode. That trail always seems so much longer than you expect. But we made it back to the car around 8:30 and took off for home. Some ThoughtsI've heard a lot of people say this route isn't very good as the upper parts can be loose and the climbing isn't as high quality. I would agree that the upper ridge isn't the best climbing I've every done, but I don't think it's much to complain about either. Maybe I've been ruined by the Cascade's crumbly rock and my definition of loose isn't what it should be. Or maybe I'm just easily pleased. Either way, I found this route to be extremely enjoyable. And the looseness of the upper ridge can be mostly avoided if one stays on the crest of the ridge as much as possible, this means climbing all the imposing towers that loom in your path! I had a great time on the climb and will probably end up doing it again someday. But I'd suggest doing it as a day trip as it doesn't take as long as one might think looking at the route from the lake. We climbed the route in 11 pitches. One could easily do a lot more by simulclimbing shorter pitched or even pithing out the whole route. But I don't think the upper ridge is worth pitching out completely. Here is the route we took... the yellow dots are belays GearRunning shoes Ice axe (trekking pole would be better) Crampons (didn't need them) Helmet Harness Double Rack to 3"" (not necessary at all but allowed is to climb real long pitches on the upper ridge) Lots of slings Images View Serpentine Arete Image Gallery - 30 Images Comments Post a Comment Viewing: 1-8 of 8 mvs - Jun 29, 2009 7:07 am - Voted 10/10 Sweet!

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/rainier-liberty-ridge-video/724713,Rainier - Liberty Ridge (video),2011-06-16,"ApproachAfter getting off Denali in under two weeks my partner and I realized we have another week of vacation left. We can either get back to work earlier and start making money, or quickly find another climb. Since on Denali we did not feel challenged by the minimal amount of actual climbing, and had no solitude, we picked Liberty Ridge - a route featured in ""Fifty Classic Climbs of North America"" by Steve Roper and Allen Steck. This 5,000ft ridge divides the stunning North Face of Mt. Rainier and features an approach through the Carbon Glacier. Checking the Mt. Rainier conditions web site left us with no other concerns, the route is 'in.' Liberty Ridge and Carbon Glacier The drive to the White River campground was exciting. Views of the mountain were supplemented with elk and bear sightings. Fear of running out of gas on the way back was overshadowed with excitement about the coming climb, and worry about the weather that was predicted to be a coin-flip between precipitation and sunny days - welcome to the PNW. When my partner and I obtained our permit, we received sad news- ""There is a rescue currently on Liberty Ridge. Actually not a rescue, it is a body recovery."" The ridge claimed another life a day before we started our approach. During the actual approach we had the courtesy of watching Chinook and other helicopters buzzing over the North side of the mountain. The approach is actually very pleasant and scenic. A mile or so in we saw a bear consuming some grass off the trail. The river flowing along the trail allows one to have access to water for most of the way up to Elmo Pass. This trail is taken by hikers, backpackers, and climbers. Approach through White River campground is taken mostly by climbers going up Emmons Glacier (probably the easiest/safest route up Mt. Rainier with a bit more elevation gain than standard Camp Muir (DC) option. But one could also approach Curtis Ridge, Liberty Ridge, Ptarmigan ridge, and routes on Willis and Liberty wall from White River as well. Bear on the approach After we got over Elmo Pass the weather started to deteriorate. By the time we reached Winthrop Glacier we were in a full whiteout. Being a stubborn bunch we continued on and ended up camping around 8,700ft on Curtis ridge. I scrambled up to the top of Curtis ridge during a clear window and discovered us way above the supposed campground (by about 1,500ft or so). At least the views of Liberty Ridge were beautiful, and the pictures turned out nice! We are young, making days harder than they should be is a good idea! The night ended up being a bit windy and cloudy, but the morning was beautiful. We were above the clouds and made our way down the Curtis ridge, towards Carbon glacier. Liberty Ridge from Curtis ridge Carbon Glacier Me on the Curtis Ridge with Liberty Ridge in the view Reaching the glacier ended up being straight forward and as we traversed bellow overhanging wall of Curtis ridge... BAMMM!!!!!!WTFF!!!! A soccer sized chunk of volcanic rock fell between my partner and I, breaking into several pieces, producing an exploding sound, and dusting the air around us. Without saying a word we moved quick through the scree and towards the entrance on to the glacier. The rock came within two meters or so from taking one of us out. Helmet would not do a damn thing to prevent a lethal injury from a rock like that. Not wearing a helmet on this route is NOT an option. Way we took to join the ridge As we worked our way up the glacier the sun began to heat things up. Part ways up we were getting fried, and our energy was drained by the heat. It is always a better idea to travel on the glacier in the early hours of the day for stronger snow bridges, and less heat. As we got to the ridge we decided to skip the traverse to the gentler slopes on the other side, and climbed a direct couloir that put us on the crest within minutes. We crossed a bergshrund and climbed a steep snow/ice/dirt mix to the crest of the ridge. After topping out we saw a set of foot marks- 'Yay! We didn't cliff out!' After that we climbed close to the crest of the ridge for the remainder of our way up to Thumb Rock camp. On the way we encountered some steeper sections and 3/4th or so class steps to get over, but they were very short. If one wants, all the scrambling can be bypassed by gentler slopes on the right side. The weather was a mix of wind and intermittent cloudiness by now. We saw a few slides on Liberty Wall, but nothing impressive, YET. I am messing around on some ice formation Liberty RidgeWe worked our way up and crossed to the other side of the ridge a couple of times, than we finally made it to camp. To our surprise there was a 6 person guided group up there. After two days of being mostly alone we didn't mind to see another group. It was reassuring hearing that they camped for an extra day up there because supposedly the next day will be nice for summiting, with gentler winds on top. After building walls for our Firstlight we made food, boiled water, and went to sleep. In the morning on the 16th of June we were almost ready to head up. Guided group left about 3 hours earlier than us, and was almost out of view higher on the ridge. I heard a noise, turned around and saw a massive ice avalanche running down the Willis Wall. I have seen avalanches before, but not quite like this one. Couple of times it launched through mid air and reached the bottom of this 5,000ft face in about 30 seconds. Lucky enough I was able to tape the whole thing. The day was only beginning, but we had seen fireworks! View above-ice cap Me climbing up some neve on the ridge Finally we got ready and got on our way up the ridge. Most of the slopes were about 45 degrees or so covered in nice hard snow. All the slopes include a drop off to the glacier, so falling would not be a good idea. We didn't plan to die here so we didn't fall. Past 55 degree snow slopes Climbing towards Black Pyramid we enjoyed the views. The weather was beautiful- we were above the clouds and wind was mostly bellow 20 mph, even during gusts. Than we reached the section of steeper climbing up to 55 degrees or so which was right before the Black Pyramid. Again it was a snow/neve slope with amazing exposure. After reaching the Pyramid we finally got on some alpine ice. My partner took the first pitch he found and we simul climbed through it. I saw another solid blue pitch off to the side and went for it. We were almost caught up to the guided group by that point so wasting time on more fun climbing was not a problem. We simul climbed through this section and made our way up to the bergshrund. Me on a solid ice pitch we found to the side of the route Although our acclimation from Denali and overall physical fitness paid off, by this point high altitude slowed us down a bit and we didn't move as fast as we did through lower section of the ridge. Waiting for the guided group to negotiate the shrund gave us a bit of needed rest. My partner got over the shrund and than I set off to catch up to the guided group. On the ice/rime pitch above the snow slope I went around them. This was fun because the sticks were mostly secure and angle very moderate. I sprinted the pitch without placing any screws and got some rest while waiting for my partner. From there it is mostly a hike up to the Liberty Cap (14,112 ft)-which is qualified as a separate peak due to it's 492 ft of prominence. At this point the wind picked up and we continued our hike towards the true summit of Mt. Rainier. I heard a lot of people fall into crevasses on the hike from Liberty Cap and true summit- I didn't plan to fall in one on this trip so we did a good job navigating this section without any incident. Me on the summit Close to the true summit the winds were booming at constant 45mph or so. We took a few summit shots, but didn't stay on the summit for too long. From here we saw that the guided group was resting just bellow Liberty Cap. Waving the summit good bye we made our way down the Emmons Glacier, and to Camp Schurman. The hike out was a bit long, but our bitterness was sweetened with over a thousand feet of awesome glissading.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/south-face-of-little-annapurna-an-unexpected-climb/872643,South Face of Little Annapurna: An Unexpected Climb,2013-09-08,"Introduction Matt Lemke and I did this trip as a spur of the moment. Originally we planned on climbing Sherpa Peak via the North Ridge. Matt however did not want to have to hike once again along the Colchuck Lake trail and wasn't feeling in the mood for climbing Sherpa. So we settled for climbing Little Annapurna via the south face which is a 5.6 (or 5.5) rock climb. So both the trip and the destination came unexpectedly along with some other surprises along the way. This trip had a long approach, brushy terrain, class 4 scrambling, loose rocks, rock climbing, and boulder hopping in the evening. This was the beginning of one of the most epic weeks of the year. Alpenglow from Sultan Alpenglow in the Sky I start running out the door with my heavy pack on. When you play the game of buses you either make the bus or fail the mission completely. As I pass the gate Tim yells to me ""where are you going?"". ""I'm going on an adventure"" I announce excitedly as I run with the climbing instructions in my hand. Kinda like the Hobbit. Lucky for me I arrived early at the bus stop. It's not that I'm paranoid of catching the bus in time, but I've lost count of adventures that have failed because of the bus being early. It would often happen right in my face when I missed it. After taking a few buses I arrive in Monroe to meet Matt. Matt drove us over to the trailhead of Ingalls Creek which by this point it was night time. Starting Out In the morning we start the 8 mile approach up Ingalls Creek. We made good time and did it in the shaded hours. Right before Crystal Creek we went right (North) off the trail and into brushy terrain. Looking up McClellan Peak (Photo by Matt Lemke) South Face of the Nightmare Needles The woods were grassy with an occasional fallen over tree. As we got higher the sun came out and it became hot. As the trees faded and the slopes opened up more there was some scrambling. Passing by a creek I asked ""should I fill up"". Matt replied ""it shouldn't be too long before we hit water again"". As we kept going up I ran out of water and was getting a bit dehydrated. As I became fatigued I kept thinking to myself ""why didn't I just go for the water when I saw it"". At the tarn we set up camp. Heading up through the Woods Approaching the Upper Crystal Creek High Point on McClellan Peak Clouds Rising on McClellan The tarn near by was very dirty which concerned me. The creek appeared dried out. I knew that if I didn't find water soon I would have to turn around. Dehydration was already making me feel dizzy and exhausted. Fortunately after a few minutes of doing up the dry creek bed we found a nice water trickle. After filling up we had lunch and got ready for climbing the South Face of Little Annapurna. Approach Gully to the South Face As we approached the gully I was quite pleased to be re-hydrated again. Starting out the gully had a bit of loose rock but wasn't too bad. As we climbed I wasn't sure where exactly the route went. Fred Beckey described the route by saying ""climb up the east gully"". No surprise there. The terrain got spicier once we arrived at the cliffy section. I decided to do a class 4 variation by going right around the cliff section. Matt went right up the crack system. Once I was on top of the bypass I saw that Matt was below me. Between him and I was a class 5 move that would be sketchy to do unroped. After evaluating it he decided he wanted to be roped up to do the move. I found a solid looking bush and setup a belay. Looking up the Gully (Matt) Looking up the Crack System (Matt) Looking Down on our Tarn (Matt) Matt Attempting to Free Solo After Matt climbed it we proceeded on with heading up the gully. Some spots were solid and others had some loose pieces. My approach shoes had less traction than your average city shoe making me a bit nervous as the exposure got higher and the moves became more demanding. Further up the gully the rock once again became crummier which required us to stay close to each other. It looked as if we could easily top out to the top of the gully. As we traversed over to the right side the exposure increased and the terrain was becoming dicier. Once we found a small platform I carefully changed into rock shoes. Matt Scrambling up the Gully Myself Scrambling Slabs (Matt) Myself Climbing Past a Sketchy Spot (Matt) Matt with the Sketch Zone The Sketchy Spot I didn't like the feeling of the place, and I sure didn't want to have to climb back down what we came up. I certainly could, but it would have been tedious and dangerous. Matt lead the sketchiest section which was a unprotectable slab with bad holds and littered with loose rock. I was honestly worried for him and was tempted to yell out ""do yourself a favor and don't climb things like this again"". I know I wasn't about to climb it with no protection, no belay, and with a perilous fall waiting below. Matt kept having to shovel off rocks and kick in to make foot holds. According to Matt he said it was 5.6 slab. I can't disagree with that. As he climbed on, rocks kept going by me making me even more nervous. You could tell that he was very unpleased with the slope and that it took a lot of concentration. Once Matt was on better ground he announced ""that was the sketchiest climb I've ever done"". Nearing the Col (Matt) Once he got to the top, a belay was set up and the rope was thrown down. I was pleased to see it didn't get caught on the loose rock. As I walked forward I couldn't help but think ""Matt, stop knocking all those rocks down on me"". What was actually happening was that the rocks were so loose that the slightest movement of the rope made them come down. Once the rocks slowed down I could finally get onto the slab section. The moves were few but enough to get by on. I would have to stop at spots to reduce the number of peddles coming down. Once I passed the slab I went through more sandy slopes with more loose rocks filling up my shoes. We were both happy to reach the col. The Crown of Little Annapurna Climbing the South Face After taking out the rocks in my shoes we hiked/scrambled on over to the south face of Little Annapurna. Matt led the first 5.4 pitch. I led the next pitch. I was amazed at what a difference the quality of the rock was. Clean climbing that was enjoyable. Matt led the final class 3 pitch. With a little bit more scrambling we arrived onto the summit of Little Annapurna. After a big snack break we could see that it was getting late. We started the hustle down racing the sun. The Final Climb up the South Face Follow the Obvious Crack (Matt) Myself Climbing the Second Pitch (Matt) Cashmere Mountain (Matt) Little Annapurna Summit Rocks (Matt) Looking Down towards Camp Myself on the Summit (Matt) Little Annapurna with Wispy Clouds The views of the enchantment basin were lovely. Lakes, green larches, and a sunset atmosphere. After passing Crystal Lake the talus picked up again. Matt Hiking down to Crystal Lake Alpenglow on the Temple Perfection Lake with The Temple It probably wasn't much more than an hour of scrambling but heading over the dark talus just kept going on and on. As we get further down Matt is now ahead and I'm finding myself surrounded by house sized boulders. Sometimes one would roll from underneath of me which I'd catch myself just in time. The holes around where getting quite big and I could help but wonder if I would be found if I fell in one. Once I arrived in the woods I became very paranoid when I saw what looked like recent bear evidence. Or was I just so out of it that I couldn't tell what it was? Couldn't tell you. After calling out Matt shined his light which I could finally spot where he was. I was about 10 minutes later to camp than Matt. We had some dinner and went to bed. Heading Out Prusik Peak and the Temple sounded like a lot of work with how tired we both were. So we both decided to call it good with what we got. On the way down we managed to miss the cairn trail and did some extra bushwhacking. After what felt like hours we arrive at the Ingalls Creek trail. Cave near Crystal Creek 8 miles later we were both happy to make it out. When I got home I seriously considered skipping Mount Shuksan. But I didn't want to let Excitableboy down and it's been a goal I've wanted to do for many years. The next day I went out to climb Mount Shuksan. I guess I just can't get enough.

Been also getting back into running. Pulled off the last scab flake tonight from that injury. I still gotta be careful. Regarding a car, it's certainly on the to do list. Once I have that and a passport I can do pretty much anything I want. The expense factor is what is keeping me from getting one. Yes I could save up to get one. But with insurance and such it's currently beyond my budget. As it is I have a hard time paying for these trips and my websites. But some day I'll get to that level.

single-day,https://www.summitpost.org/sailing-away-on-argonaut/851445,Sailing away on Argonaut,2013-05-31,"Our Approach So Argonaut Peak has been on my short list since November 2012 when I attempted it in a snowstorm via the terrible south route. After that trip where nothing was accomplished other than a gear soaking and 25 dollars in wasted gas, I told myself I was going to climb Argonaut from a north side route. Now, five months later in the end of May I had my chance to get revenge on this peak. I spoke with Danial on CascadeClimbers and we were set on the idea of climbing the NW arete which from what we heard is a slightly sandbagged 5.6 climb of 5 pitches. Even so, we were both up for the challenge and agreed to go light and take just two 30 meter alpine ropes and make a day trip out of it. As you will see below, this didn't exactly happen and we had to change our plans accordingly. Sunrise on Mount Stuart from the trail Sunrise on Argonaut with the NW arete at right skyline and NE Couloir on left So at 2:15 am we met in Monroe and like always I didn't bother going to sleep that night. I got off work at 9pm, had some dinner and drove up to Josh's house to borrow his 30 meter rope so we could have two to use as half ropes and in case of a longer rappel. Daniel drove from Monroe and at 4:30am we arrived at the Mountaineers Creek trailhead and started up the trail just as there was enough light to avoid using headlamps. We made quick work of the trail to the junction with the Colchuck Lake trail and we continued straight and arrived at the famous clearing where the first views of Argonaut and Sherpa are seen. Just as I got a first glimpse of Argonaut I was bummed at how much fresh snow was on the NW arete. Danial and I both became concerned and we talked briefly about what we might do. Luckily I had read the route description for the NE couloir many times and said if the arete is going to just be soaked we could do the couloir. We continued and slightly past the opening, we left the trail right as it made a sharp right turn and bushwhacked over lots of deadfall until we reached the creek draining out from Stuart Lake. We searched for awhile to find a log to cross on and ended up ascending 50 feet or so along the creek before locating a somewhat sketchy narrow and wet log to flail across on. Once across we veered left back towards Mountaineer Creek and since Danial had made this approach before he knew we needed to aim for the talus a couple hundred feet above the creek to its west which avoids most of the terrible bushwhacking along the valley floor. Once again one of my personal commandments of mountaineering working perfectly....Commandment number 3/10, NEVER get suckered into following along a creek below treeline! Sherpa Peak to the west Once we ran out of talus and the small cliffs below us were gone we descended slightly to the spot where Mountaineers Creek diverges. One creek comes off the north side of Sherpa while the other comes down from the right off the north side of Stuart. We crossed both and continued south through easier forest until we broke out of the trees and arrived at the base of the infamous slide alder slope from hell. Luckily there is a way around it all by cutting to the right and ascending up good talus to the west of the swath of slide alder. This is exactly what we did and only once did we even touch a piece of slide alder! I was feeling great and we made great time ascending from 4,800 feet at the base of the slope to 6,500 feet in a small bowl just below the north face of Argonaut. We put our crampons on around 5,500 feet when the talus became mostly snow covered and the hard snow was perfect for booting up. We finally reached sunshine once we got to the tiny bowl where we had a nice rest. Base of the north face with the NE couloir heading up the left side Looking up the NE couloir from the bottom NE Couloir climb Almost instinctively without either one of us saying much we decided it would be better to do the NE couloir since it would be in much better condition and more enjoyable given the current conditions. So we started up which was first mellow for a ways but we ran into some ice sections right before the couloir gets narrow. We both had crampoons but I was wearing my flexible snow boots instead of mountaineering boots...I remember telling myself, ""well this will be interesting!"" I crossed over the center of the couloir where the ice was hardest and got to a nice moat to stand on where I set up an anchor and we prepared to simul-climb the couloir. We each just had one regular axe as well so climbing up the ice in the center of the couloir was harder. The couloir from the first narrow constriction all the way to its top was a load of fun and we were able to find some softer snow away from the middle and we were easily able to occasionally place a piece of rock pro in the rock walls along the sides. We arrived at the top of the couloir and cut right up a chimney which was very low angle and covered in fresh snow that had been in the sun longer. Climbing this was interesting for sure as there were some low 5th class rock slabs and other dirty stuff that was dripping the whole time but we continued up simul-climbing until we reached the upper snowfield. Starting up some 35 degree snow Starting up the first narrow constriction Simul-Climbing the couloir Near the end of the couloir Climbing up a dirty wet chimney above the couloir After a much needed snack we booted up the final couple hundred feet to the ridge and scrambled some snow covered class 3 to the summit block. This has to be one of the most unique summit blocks around! We crossed under toe huge leading boulder and made a short 10 foot Class 4 climb to the summit. According the the register we are the first to climb Argonaut in 2013 but there is no way that can be true. We spent a half hour soaking in the great views of Stuart, Colchuck and Cashmere. In the distance, Rainier was visible poking through some of the clouds but most of the North Cascades weren't really visible. Mount Daniel was decked in snow! Looking across to Colchuck Peak from the top of the NE Couloir Arriving at the upper snowfield Summit Block Stuart from Argonaut Little Annapurna from Argonaut Colchuck and Dragontail from the summit Our Descent After our fill of views, right as the breeze picked up we started down and scrambled the ridge back and plunged down the soft snow towards the top of the east face. We both agreed we did not want to go down the way we came up and the 2000+ foot glissade down the Colchuck Glacier was highly influencing our decision to descend the east gully and traverse to Colchuck Col. We searched for a place to begin rappelling down the slabs just north of the east gully and located a yellow sling around a block. So off we went with our ropes tied together. They were just long enough to reach a small tree with another sling around it but this second rappel looked committing and we didn't know if we could reach the east gully from where we predicted the rope would run out. I decided to head down first with prussiks to see if we could either make another anchor or find a way to traverse right at the bottom of the rappel. When I got to the bottom of the rope I noticed a nice ledge that looked like it would go right to the gully but since it was wet and snow covered with big cliffs below I didn't want to just run across unroped especially with flexible boots on. I hollored for Danial to come down while I set up an anchor with a couple cams and we pulled the rope (relieved it didn't get stuck) and he led off across the ledge while I belayed. He went across 30 meters and got a nice spot to belay me across and I'll have to say I am glad I didn't try it unroped because it was a bit scary. Once I got across we were able to jump into the east gully and fire our way down the rest of the way. Daniel starting across the wet ledge Looking back at the east gully Argonaut Peak...look closely and you can see our steps on the upper snowfield! Once out of the gully we began slogging through soft snow in the hot sun all the way to Colchuck Col where we had to lose 400 feet more of elevation to go around a rock rib then re-gain it to reach the col. Luckily I was feeling a second wind and I mashed through this section pretty quick and broke trail most of the way with my eyes closed since I had forgotten sunglasses. Once at the col we jumped off and glissaded over 2,500 feet down right to the lake! What fun. The ensuing hike out the Colchuck Lake trail was the same as always...longer than it really is and painful on the knees but once back at the car, 15 hours after we started, we were glad we did the NE couloir and happy with the day.

I had heard you had the first winter ascent...well done! I will have to respectfully disagree however that Argonaut gets climbed once or twice a year. It is one of the Bulgers and considerably easier than Boston Peak, which I know from reading the large Mazama summit register book gets about 10 parties a year. Maybe I am wrong but I can't imagine Boston Peak getting more ascents than Argonaut. I have heard of quite a few people making it up the std south route on Argonaut and looking through the brass register on Argonaut it appeared to have quite a bit of ascents last summer. Anyways, thanks for the nice words and I hope you have an awesome year!

single-day,https://www.summitpost.org/above-the-inversion-layer/835502,Above the Inversion Layer,2013-01-15,"IntroductionWinters in Washington State often can be brutal in terms of lack of sunshine and rainy days. That being said in the few times it is sunny Washington State turns into the ultimate picturesque winter wonderland. The snow that falls during the bad weather days in the winter tends to cling to every rock and tree branch in the mountains which makes picture taking in winter ultimately amazing. That is why I find winter here in Washington to be the most beautiful of all seasons to hike in the mountains. The 10-20% of the time that the the weather is good in winter there is no other range of mountains I would rather want to be in. This is especially the case when an inversion layer sets up in the Puget Sound Region. Usually once or twice a year warm air from the south with actually ride up over the cold air in the Puget Sound Region that is trapped at the surface and set a layer of fog or clouds. This can vary from low stratus clouds at 2000 or total fog in the city. What lies above the inversion layer is clear bluebird sky and warmer temperatures. This inversion layer is also a photographers dream in that it often covers the lower elevations with clouds and saves the higher mountains for amazing views. If a hiker or climber can get hit this inversion layer right, he will be in for an amazing treat. Map of our route up Goat Mountain.Zephyr2us and I noticed this instantly when planning out our week. The weather forecast for the week actually called for the inversion to start to happen. We had been looking at a couple trip reports and we took note of this mountain and decided to give it a go. Our only concern was that we would go above the inversion layer which was supposed to be 4500 feet. We specifically picked this mountain because we knew that there had been a couple of other people on the mountain already and we really had no desire to spend the whole trip kicking in steps. Knowing from what we saw Goat Mountain was a proven good snowshoe we decided to head for the mountain. Climbing Up In Hopes For Some SunshineWe got to the trailhead and predictably the weather was cloudy and dark. It really did not look very desirable for hiking but we were hope for that weather break. The start of this trip was a real slog up the forest road. We started about 800 feet and we hit our first little dusty literally immediately. However we would have to go all the way up to 1500 feet before the snow was significant enough to warrant snowshoe. During the road slog up we were greeted with some occasional nice pictures of the lower valley and an occasional cloud break on a larger mountain but the weather was still very cold. Some views below the inversion. The long road snow slog was a little annoying but the beautiful flocked treats and the occasional breaks in the overcast kept us hopeful. At about 3500 feet we entered the fog level. This was right about the elevation we left the snow slog and headed up the mountain. We decided to take gentler way up the mountain which even though it was slightly beaten in it wasn’t all that gentle. Each step at this point was quiet tough and our hopes for good views started to diminish. Hitting the inversion layer Powering above the inversion layer. All of the sudden we noticed blue just above us. At about 4000 feet we got above the inversion layer and the blue sky above greeted us with a warm and amazing sunshine. This lifted both of our spirits and though we were on our steepest terrain of the day we actually were moving our quickest on the trip. Views of the surrounding countryside were excellent from what we saw in the trees and it inspired us more to get to the summit. Soon we could see the summit area in sight. Almost on the summit. The Warmth of the Summit Zephyr2us on the summit of Goat Mountain. A view while nearing the summit. We continued following the tracks all of the way to the summit where excellent views awaited. We noticed the 50 foot rock outcrop that awaited us and from below it looked quiet intimidating. As we got closer though we noticed that the there was a good path to the summit. The snow started to consolidate which is really makes it easier for that last 30-50 foot section to the summit. We followed the path to the summit where we were greeted with excellent views of the northern Cascade front. A look down the ridge. A shot back at Little Billy. With the inversion layer being about 4000 feet, the cloud layer seemed to separate us from civilization below. Most of the logging was out of sight leaving us dramatic views of Mount Baker, Mount Shuksan and much of the Cascade front. We could see Glacier Peak, Sloan Peak and Whitehorse off in the distance and even see a distant shot of Mount Rainier. The above the clouds effect was in full force on this mountain and we were greeted with incredible views. We had to stay away from the large cornice that hugged the western side of the summit. It looked stable but we didn’t exactly go over to it and test it. Unfortunately Heading Back into the Clouds Time to head on down. We stopped at the summit and spent some time on it. In the thirty minutes we were up there we noticed the shadow change on the mountains. We also noticed the fact that is was considerably warmer on the summit than in the clouds below. There was no real wind above making this summit visit a real treat. Compared to the rest of the trip and to what we had experienced over much of the winter this was nirvana. We took that time to soak up the sun but once we noticed that we were out of time we knew it was time to head on down. We headed back down generally the same way we came up with one noted exception. Back into the inversion layer. Once we hit the road at 3800 feet we took a different shortcut. The inversion level had now lowered to this point and we were just above the fog. This shortcut shortened the trip but it was much steeper and traction was a lot tougher going down. We instantly hit the fog which felt like being hit with ice. We had to battle through a lot of tree trap shrubs and rough areas as we made it down this supposedly short cut. A couple of times I fell in about waist deep of powder and it were tough getting up. I managed but that “shortcut” was no fun going now. Some views back below the inversion layer. Sun setting in the mountains. Once down at the road though we knew we had to speed up in order to make the car before sunset. Luckily the trail on the road was well broken in and we were able to speed down the mountain. We took no other shortcuts and outside of a couple new views we spent little time stopping. Once we got past the bulk of the snow we real took on a jogging pace. We took only 20 minutes in the last 1 ½ miles making it back to the car well before sunset. From there we just headed directly on home. ConclusionThe only unfortunate thing about this trip was that it was the only trip I did during this special event in the Seattle winter. My later hikes were cancelled one by one due to a stomach virus and others giving me late notice about a trip. I think though I hit this mountain though perfectly because if the fog level was lower this trip wouldn’t have been quiet as special. I was glad that at least this one time I was truly able to enjoy this great break in the weather in the Washington Cascades. I want to thank my always reliable climbing friend Zephyr for making another awesome snowshoe.

single-day,https://www.summitpost.org/american-border-peak-southeast-face-route/809144,American Border Peak - Southeast Face route,2012-08-08,"PrologueWhen Adam told me we were meeting in Arlington at three in the morning, and that I therefore needed to be at his house at two-thirty, I was skeptical: what 8 mile, 2830 foot, climb could possibly demand a start that early? I had no idea. Several years ago I had seen American Border Peak from our high point on a Tomyhoi attempt and I had remembered it was an impressive mountain, but I had little recollection of the specifics. If I had known that the day would comprise quite possibly my most intense climb to date, I certainly would have still gone, but I might have brought more water. The Approach On the twenty-fifth of August, Adam (gimpilator), Robbin, Ryan and myself left Arlington at three in the morning to climb American Border Peak. After arriving at the Winchester Mountain trailhead at six we promptly set off in the wrong direction - down the road past the second lake. Fortunately we soon realized our mistake and bushwhacked back to the High Pass trail, which we reached just as it starts to descend. We covered the ground to Low Pass, up the ridge to High Pass, and then down the Gargett Mine fairly quickly and were soon side-hilling through wildflower covered talus. Just short of the shoulder we hit a particularly steep portion of the slope that would take us the better part of an hour to navigate. Klenke’s route page says to stay low and some in our party were advocating for descending a couple hundred feet to where the angle of the slope was more shallow but we found that if you ascend to just below the cliff band, as in - within twenty feet of the cliff band, it was not too unreasonable. The first thirty feet were probably the hardest but after that there was enough brush to form natural steps. Although not quite the crux of the climb (as I naively thought it might be), it was probably the trickiest section below the saddle. Once over the wooded shoulder we traversed easily across heather slopes to the scree field that led to the notch. This section was frustrating, as the entire slope seems ready to slide at the slightest suggestion, but not all that difficult. In retrospect it may have been easier to stay to the sides and avoid the looser middle section entirely but I am not sure. On the opposite side of the notch we found slopes depressingly similar to what we had just ascended, but as if to make up for it we got our first view of the summit, as well as some rather unlikely-looking rock spires on the ridge to the south. As we started to descend Ryan realized that his gallon jug of water was leaking and we stashed it on a rock for our return. We were afraid that the gullies we had to cross to reach the saddle would be a repeat of the slope before the wooded shelter but were relieved when they turned out to be much easier and consisted mostly of a series of light grey steps that seemed much more solid than the usual reddish rock. The Climb Around noon we reached the saddle and got our first good look at what the route would entail. At that point Robbin turned around Adam would do the same shortly thereafter. From the saddle the route follows the crest for a few hundred feet before traversing across some “shelves” (loose, down-sloping rock) and ascending a gully to near the first notch. From Klenke’s the route description we were unsure which notch, we saw three, was the correct one but after checking out the middle one we determined that the route must follow the farthest north, snow-filled gully. It looked like it might be possible to climb through the moat to the left of the snow finger with minimal exposure but there was one rock step that didn’t look feasible, we therefore roped up, protected ourselves with an ice axe belay, and climbed about fifteen feet on the snow finger before returning to the moat. This section made us very glad we had hauled ice axes and crampons all that way. The ledges across to the chimney were nerve-rackingly narrow but not really problematic The chimney itself was a bit of a surprise. Instead of a 5.4 rock climb what we found was a very difficult to protect 5.8. Or rather, four 5.8 crux section, where one climbs around the various chockstones, connected by stretched of easy class three. These were more awkward than difficult, but I was glad none-the-less to have a top rope (Ryan led both pitches). They keyhole was unique and fun in a way, although I felt a little like I was crawling out of the underworld like the first men of Pueblo legend. At the belay point above the chimney we stashed the rope (a mistake we would regret) and scrambled up the the summit ridge, which, being loose, exposed class 4, was likely the most dangerous section of the climb. From there the climb was basically over, just fifteen minutes of class 2-3 over to the summit block where we found a register that had not been signed since 2009. I would be very surprised if other parties have not made the summit in those three years, but perhaps they did it earlier when it was snow-covered. As we had summited almost exactly at our turn-around time (we had been oscillating between 3:00 and 3:30 and summited at 3:15) we stayed for only a few minutes and then began the descent. The DescentFrom the summit back to the saddle took us about three hours, almost as long as the ascent, which was not terribly surprising as route finding became rather difficult past the snow finger. We rappelled down both the chimney (over the highest chockstone) and the gully, both of which were a little dicey due to rock-fall, questionable anchors, and the rope being about five meters shorter than it needed to be, and we wished we had been able to rappel the class four above the chimney as well. Through the section between the snow finger and the ledges we were regularly sending down rockfall that reached the glacier a thousand feet below. Once at the saddle we descended quickly and reached our water stash in 45 minutes, the shoulder in another 45 minutes (we initially hit too high and had to descend to where we crossed on the approach), and then the trail below High Pass just as it was getting dark. This put us at the trailhead around 9:30, 15.5 hours after we had left that morning. EvaluationMe and Ryan were basically in agreement, we are glad we did the peak, but we never want to come back again. What would otherwise be fun class three rock scrambling was some of the most dangerous climbing either of us have done, and the arduous approach made it all the more difficult.

I'm really glad you two were able to make the summit. I've been itching to try this route for several years now. It did prove to be beyond level of risk I'm willing to take at this time, but I don't regret giving it a try. Looking at the map I estimate that I was about 900 feet below the summit when I turned around. I think we might agree that the approach was lousy, albeit scenic.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/glacier-basin-07/303812,Glacier Basin '07,2007-06-20,"Glacier Basin One of the biggest issues for this hike is the 4 mile gated private road you have to walk on just to get to the actual basin trailhead, which is located in the old Monte Cristo townsite. Having been there before, I knew this, so I told my friends to bring mountain bikes, and that I would bring a lock (there is a bike rack in the town). So that was great, except for one small problem, the road washed out in 3 different spots, completely. I knew there was extensive flood damage from this last winter, and this particular road was not immune. The camera was packed away for the ride, so I didnt get pictures, sorry, but rest assured that its bad, and in one spot there is a nothing but a treacherous log crossing (made harder by carrying a bike). But all things considered, it still made that leg of the trip a fraction of time it would take otherwise, so I highly recommend anyone going to Gothic Basin, Glacier Basin, Twin, Silver lakes, or just to Monte Cristo to take a bike, because the road is really not very interesting. Once you get to the actual old mining townsite, you have to wander through it, see it once if you haven't yet, but most of the historic buildings were torn down years ago for safety reasons I guess, so its not spectacular. Then you come upon a hub of trailheads, with the trail to Silver and Twin lakes going one way, Glacier Basin another, and a place called Sunday falls in even another direction (theres actually one unmarked trail too, but I've heard there is still private property up in that area still). Onward..... The trail itself fits the classic description of a miners trail, rocky, steep, and horrific....personally, I love it. It winds through the forest for a short distance, then opens up into a lovely alpine meadow and rockslide area, then immediately thereafter, you get to look straight uphill where you gain basically all the elevation (2200') within half a mile. And if that wasn't bad enough, its slick, sliding rocky stuff, with some good footing and some bad, with short trees and neddles surrounding the trail and catching your pack, threatening to drag you over backwards. But it's worth it. Once you get past that, its a smooth, gentle incline following the creek that leaves the basin itself, and, while we had a lot of snow this time (with all the post-holing you could ever want), later in season its easy rock and dirt trail. Then you arrive: The basin, with Monte Cristo Peak at the head So, as a day hike, there are tons of big flat rocks to have lunch on before you start heading back. But we were doing overnight, and the weather today was great (forecast said mostly cloudy...BAH...worthless). We had discussed maybe climbing one of the many peaks accessible from the basin, with Cadet, Monte Cristo, and Kyes on the list. We decided to start going and decide how we felt when we got to them. Climbing, etc. The basin proper is fairly small, but the some of the cliffs are shear faces, and the snow gets steep MUCH faster than one would like it to, much steeper in parts than seen here: We got to the little saddle thing, where people usually approach some of the peaks, and honestly weren't feeling 100%, so we decided the saddle was a pretty big accomplishment in itself, and called it a day there. It did have great views regardless. That's Blanca Lake covered in snow there, One of my higher rated pictures is that lake in later season, which is the lovely deep green color from the Glacial till from the Columbia Glacier, also seen in this picture. The prominent peak in the far background, left, is Mt Daniel. Here is a panorama I made as an afterthought of our stopping point (read the note on the picture page before you attack me about the shoddy stitching). Cadet peak on the left, Monte Cristo in center, and part of Kyes on the right We decided the way we came up was way too scary to try to downclimb, since it was fairly exposed below the shocking steep snow. So we did a circuit of the basin and went down the other way. This is a picture that somewhat encompasses the route we took to get up, if you look closely in the zoomed in size, you might be able to spot our tracks. Columbia Peak on the left. As we were nearing camp, I spotted this odd spider out in the middle of the snowfield we were crossing, probably just above 5000', the spider itself was bigger than a quarter. Any facts about this guy are appreciated, I've never seen a spider that size up that high before. Sunset time. I went up a small ridge near our camp to try to get some sunset pictures. Just my luck, I had forgotten that it was the solstice, also known as the longest day of the year, so I promptly took a nap on a flat rock until the sun FINALLY started setting. Good view of Del Campo peak, one of my favorites, with Gothic Peak just left of it. Now for the real sunset. Three fingers is easy to spot on the right. I probably took 50 pictures of the sunset, thus it was difficult to choose which ones to upload here, but I feel I chose pretty good ones. This was my first trip with my fancy new camera remote that allows me to take very, very long exposures. Which lead to my first successful foray into night photography. This one is Cadet Peak, you can see that its still somewhat twilight. Monte Cristo Peak, note the cloudy band of the Milky Way actually showing up. Show me the way to go home. We awoke at dawn, to a basin filled to the brim with clouds, but according to Murphy's laws, since we were already sunburned, as soon as we finished packing (hurts with cold fingers), the sun burned through the clouds and it was scorching hot again. A great stopover on either the way down or the way up, during the horrid steep part of the trail is this lovely waterfall, which blows amazing, freezing mist onto a big flat sitting rock....a moment of peace for a burned cookie such as myself. After lingering there too long, we made our way down, made our knees a new kind of sore, and coveted the bike ride back..... Ohhhh was it worth it! As the road is uphill to the townsite, thats right, its DOWNHILL, the whole way back (minus the river crossings). Which is absolutely glorious on a bike, and made our return trip the smallest fraction of the time it took to get there, and honestly, made the road something to look forward to, instead of something to dread. That's about it, theres a great burger joint we stopped by in Granite Falls, with probably the best Peanut Butter Chocolate malt shake I've ever had, hits the spot when you're tired and hungry. Get out there, and be safe!

single-day,https://www.summitpost.org/are-you-nuts-prusik-peak-in-a-day/879499,Are you nuts? Prusik Peak in a day.,2013-09-14,"Trip Report ""Are you nuts? Still in the ICC mode i see.  Well, i do have interest in prusik but not the death march.""  That was a friend's text message reply when I asked him if he wanted to join me for a mid-September Prusik Peak climb. Nestled in the heart of the Central Cascades Prusik Peak is an iconic granite spire popular with climbers.  I was planning on climbing Prusik via the West Ridge, a classic climb described as ""…a route of purity on marvelous granite"" by Fred Becky (who made the first ascent of the West Ridge in 1957).  Of the multiple routes to the summit of Prusik the West Ridge is the easiest. The catch is that Prusik Peak is located in the heart of the Enchantment Lakes region, lying at almost the exact mid-point of the two approach routes to the base of the peak—approximately ten miles one-way in either direction.  There's the rub. Most people who climb Prusik have secured one of the scarce camping permits and spend the night. One of the top hiking destinations in Washington, the Enchantments are located in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness outside the town of Leavenworth, only a couple hours drive from Seattle.  To prevent the Enchantments from being loved to death the Forest Service carefully rations camping permits. Registration opened in February, so by our September climb the permits were all long-since spoken for.  Since camping was not an option that meant in addition to the climb we would have to thru-hike the Enchantments, over twenty miles of hiking, all in a single day. Colchuck Lake In September Washington State was having a great run of late-summer weather and Prusik had been on my ""to-climb"" list for a long time so I was determined to climb it regardless of a camping permit. That left me with the issue of who to climb with.  Hmmm…I thought whom do I know who lives for death marches (so to speak)?  Of course, Jason! He's the one person I know who would be interested in climbing Prusik in a day.  Jason is a hard-core hiker who loves fast hiking big trails.  As it turned out the most difficult thing about convincing Jason to climb Prusik wasn't that it was too hard, but rather that it was too easy.  Jason had already one-day hiked the Enchantments four times and has since graduated to bigger challenges like thru-hiking across the Cascade Mountains.  Although Jason was bored with the Enchantments thru-hike I was able to persuade him to go—he was ready for a Prusik rematch.  He had attempted it once before, but it was early season and he had been turned back by bad weather. Aasgard Pass The Enchantments thru-hike trail is horseshoe shaped and most people set-up a car shuttle.  Our plan for the thru-hike was to hike from West to East.  In the hiking guidebook 100 Classic Hikes in Washington the authors had some strong opinions about the best Enchantments thru-hike direction (East to West in their estimation) and tut-tutted with disapproval our chosen route: A concluding personal opinion: In recent years the Aasgard Fraud has been perpetrated.  The innocent are suckered in by being told that climbing from Colchuck Lake to Aasgard Pass is ""the easy way to the Enchantments.""  False.  The fad followers, the in-crowd wannabes, deem the Snow Creek approach demeaning, want to the classy and sassy way, the rout of the big kids.  A wilderness-mature adult ascends ritually and respectfully from the picturesque lower basin to the austere upper basin and at last to the cold snows and stern stones of Aasgard.  To start with the ice cream and work through the meatballs and potatoes to the soup is not esthetic.  Coming to the Enchantments by way of Aasgard is in very bad taste. Witches Tower and Dragontail Peak from summit of Aasgard Pass Well there's no accounting for taste.  That was first published in 1998 and clearly the culture has continued to degrade so that by 2013 the standard route for thru-hikers is to start at the Stuart Lake trailhead to hike up Aasgard Pass and hike out via Snow Lake, exiting at the Snow Lake trailhead parking lot.  Since we were only taking one vehicle we could not car-shuttle so my original plan (which would have met with the 100 Hikes authors' approval) was to stash mountain bikes at the Stuart Lake trailhead and drive back to the Snow Lake trailhead.  From there we would do the whole thru-hike back to the bikes and then ride back to the car.  Jason, with his Enchantments experience talked me out of this complicated plan.  Jason advised that since we were going to the Enchantments during peak season there would be plenty of other thru-hikers setting up car shuttles so we could just hitchhike to the Stuart Lake trailhead. The last time I was in the Enchantments was the fall of 2008.  I was with a large group and we set-up a car shuttle.  We were thru-hiking the Enchantments West-to-East then too, but we had camping permits for two nights so we traveled at a leisurely pace.  The Enchantments are justifiably famous as one of the most beautiful places in Washington State. During that first trip through I was in a constant state of alpine-induced euphoria, completely blown away by the scenery. Flanked by jagged mountain peaks the Enchantments are a chain of high alpine lakes that stretch from West to East starting at the barren moonscapes of Aasgard Pass and descending gradually down to the larch tree ringed shores of Lake Viviane in the shadow of Prusik Peak.  Along the trail we passed dozens of lakes and ponds, huge slabs of glacier-polished granite, snowfields, waterfalls, gnarled trees sculpted by fierce mountain storms, picturesque alpine meadows, fields of heather, larches turned golden by fall, and lots of snowy white mountain goats. It was during that trip that I first glimpsed Prusik Peak.  That striking cathedral-like spire of white granite made an impression on me and I used it as the setting for a short story I wrote [see Links section below] about a young climber soloing Prusik's challenging south face. I vowed that someday I would return and climb it.  At the time I lacked the skills so Prusik is one of the peaks that inspired me to take more climbing classes. The Upper Enchantments as seen from Aasgard Pass. During that same 2008 Enchantments trip we occasionally passed one-day thru-hikers.  At the time I thought they were totally nuts, but fast forward five years and now I was planning on thru-hiking the Enchantments in one day in addition to climbing Prusik Peak.  As my friend observed I was ""Still in ICC mode…""  The ICC he was referring to is the Boeing Alpine Society's Intermediate Climbing Class—BOEALPS ICC for short.  In 2012 I was an instructor in the BOEAPS Basic Climbing Class, but in 2013 I returned to BOEALPS as a student in the ICC.  I wanted to improve my technical climbing skills so I could do things like climb Prusik Peak. The BCC introduces students to the fundamentals of mountaineering, while the ICC is an alpine climbing class that prepares students to climb technical rock and ice routes.  It also significantly ups the intensity of the climbs compared to the BCC.  Summit days for some of my ICC alpine climbs went as long as twenty-two hours of non-stop hiking and climbing.  In spite of that I counted myself as one of the lucky one.  Some of the other students in my class experienced summit days that exceeded twenty-four hours.  Based on trip reports I read on-line I estimated that my Prusik-In-A-Day climb could take anywhere from fourteen to twenty hours.  The ICC stretched the boundaries of what I thought I was capable of, so twenty hours sounded within my abilities.  Of course to any reasonable person who hasn't been through the ICC wringer that sounds like a ""death march"". Upper Enchantments My original plan was to sleep at the trailhead Friday night, but Jason had tickets to a Sounders soccer game so we ended up leaving Seattle very early Saturday morning instead.  Apparently it was a good game (I heard all about it on the drive over), the Sounders beat the number one ranked Real Salt Lake, but I when my alarm went off at 3:30am Saturday morning I can tell you I was not the world's biggest Sounders fan.   After a brief pit stop in Leavenworth for coffee we headed to Icicle Creak Road and the Snow Lake Trailhead parking lot.  Dawn had broken by the time we arrived, so we were running a little late by my estimation.  Sunrise was at 6:40am and I had hoped we would start hiking in the pre-dawn twilight.  Sunset was at 7:15pm so we only had twelve-and-a-half hours of daylight and we needed every hour of sunshine so we could finish the boulder strewn descent from the Enchantments before nightfall. Jason was right about hitchhiking, we got a ride so quickly I didn't even have time to finish my coffee and had to abandon it on the bumper of Jason's truck.  A group of young hikers were setting up a car shuttle for their own Enchantments thru-hike and agreed to give us a lift to the trailhead.  There were four of us stuffed in the back of a Subaru Outback.  It was not a comfortable ride, I was sitting on the car door armrest as we drove up a bumpy dirt road, but I didn't care so long as we got to the trailhead. Approaching the Lower Enchantments Arriving at the trailhead at 7:30am we thanked the hikers for the lift and hit the trail, there was no time to waste.  We were starting about an hour later that I would have liked.  At least the weather would not be an issue for us, it was the last weekend of summer and the forecast was for clear blue skies and temperatures approaching 100° in Leavenworth.  One hundred degrees would be too hot for an enjoyable climb, but the Enchantment Lakes lie at an elevation of approximately seven thousand feet so one hundred degrees in Leavenworth would translate to just about absolutely perfect temperatures in the high-sixties for our climb. Mountain Goats The first important milestone on the trail is reaching Colchuck lake which lies at the base of Aasgard Pass.  We were making good time, but on the trail up to Colchuck lake we got briefly off route and just my luck I stepped on a hornets nest.  I did not know what was happening until I inexplicably felt agonizing pain from my legs.  I was wearing shorts and looked down in horror to see both of my legs covered with angry hornets.  You know in the cartoons when someone is being chased by an angry swarm of bees and they are running and flailing their arms like a madman.  It was exactly like that.  Once I was finally free of the hornets I counted at least eight stings on my legs.  They ached like hell, but there wasn't any time to worry about that we still had long way to go and we hadn't even started the hike up Aasgard Pass yet. Right before heading up Aasgard Pass we stopped to fill our water bottles from an ice-cold snowmelt stream that crossed the trial.  Jason carried two bicycle style water bottles, which worked better than my single Nalgene bottle since he could drink water on the fly, thus saving time over having to unscrew a Nalgene and stop to drink.  We were using Aquamira to chemically purify our drinking water so a Nalgene bottle that could interface with a water filter or could withstand the heat of boiled water wasn't necessary.  The route follows lakes and streams most of the way so there was no need to carry more than a liter of water. Mountain Goat I tried to pack as lightly as possible because of the distance and speed we were going to be hiking.  With a full water bottle my pack weighed in at just under twenty-six pounds (I wasn't carrying the rope).  Even with a light pack I still had no hope of keeping up with Jason who is a fast hiker.  He is not a dick so he never said anything, but for the whole twenty miles he was usually way a head of me on the trail or stopped waiting for me to catch up.  Jason was already carrying the rope and on the way up Aasgard Pass he offered to carry the rack too, but I declined. I had to maintain a shred of my dignity. The hike up Aasgard Pass is a slog, you gain 2200 feet of elevation in the space of just ¾ of a mile.  The crest of Aasgard Pass lies at 7800 feet—only two hundred feet lower than the summit of Prusik Peak.  I spoke to some hikers on the trail who had been there in the spring when the pass was still covered in snow and said they needed ice axes.  Once you get to the top of Aasgard you are rewarded with terrific views, both looking back West towards Colchuck Lake and East as you get your first glimpse of the Upper Enchantments.  It's a landscape of desolate beauty looking like it just emerged from the end of an ice age and the glaciers have only recently receded.  It's the sort of scene that you could easily picture herds of Wooly Mammoths thundering across while hotly pursued by stone spear wielding cavemen. The Starks' Enchantments If you look at a map of the Enchantments one of the things you will notice is that there is a strong streak of the fantastic in the names of the dozens of lakes and ponds that dot the high alpine basins.  Someone was in a very fanciful mood when they were naming the features of the Enchantments, which I can understand.  I've seen the late-afternoon light glinting off the lakes of the Lower Enchantments and it was mythically beautiful.  According to the guidebook 100 Hikes in Washington's Alpine Lakes the area was explored in the 1950s by a couple, Bill and Peg Stark: …who over many years drew on various mythologies to name other features.  A lake and its sword like rock peninsula became Lake Viviane and Excalibur Rock.  Other lakes and tarns they called Rune, Talisman, Valkyrie, Leprechaun, Naiad, Lorelei, Dryad, Pixie, Gnome, Brisingamen, Brynhild, Reginleif, Sprite, and Titania.  And there is Troll Sink (a pond), Valhalla Cirque, Tanglewood, and many more. Getting closer The scenery was great and you could spend a lot of time taking photographs, but we were burning daylight and needed to move quickly so the best I could do was to snap quick photos on the fly.  We swiftly crossed the Upper Enchantments.  It was not long before we caught our first glimpse of Prusik Peak.  The classic view of Prusik is from up close.  From that perspective it appears to be a stand-alone peak.  However, Prusik Peak looks very different depending on which combination of distance and angle you view it from.  From the Upper Enchantments Prusik looks a lot less dramatic and it's very obvious that it's just the western end of Temple Ridge. As you descend from the Upper to the Lower Enchantments the scenery become more inviting.  Patches of greenery appear and the first groves of larch trees dot the landscape.  You also run into the first of many mountain goats.  One of the things you learn hiking the Enchantments is that mountain goats are not an endangered species.  By my count we passed at least a dozen lounging by the side of the trail.  The goats like to hang out near humans in the Enchantments so they can drink our pee.  It sounds disgusting, but they do it because the need the salt in our urine.  There are signs at the trailhead asking people to pee on rocks and not plants because the goats will dig up the ground to get at the salts, destroying the fragile alpine plant life in the process. Rune Lake There's no shortage of rock in the Enchantments.  One of the signature features of the Enchantments are the great slabs of polished white granite that cover the landscape.  In the guidebook Selected Climbs in the Cascades Prusik Peak is celebrated for featuring ""Rock of such quality that it has become the standard by which other Cascade climbs boasting good rock are compared.""  Typically the rock in the Cascades is only fair to middling quality.  I had been climbing on mediocre rock all summer so part of the appeal of Prusik was to experience what good rock feels like. Prusik Pass trail In the Lower Enchantments on our way to Prusik Pass we ran into a group of guys with fishing rods.  I asked them about it and they said the Enchantment lakes are full of trout.  They named at least three varieties (I forget the types).  You don't have to catch and release either, the trout are an introduced species overpopulating the lakes, so you're helping the environment by fishing.  I remember seeing guys back in 2008 fly fishing in Leprechaun Lake.  It was near sunset and they were fly casting in the late afternoon glow.  It looked like a scene right out of the movie A River Runs Through It.  I'd like to return next fall with a fishing rod (and a camping permit). A goal for next year will be to work fishing into some of my climbing trips.  I know of at least three climbs where this will work: Mount Olympus, Mount Constance, and Prusik. At Rune Lake (aka Perfection Lake) we turned off the main trail to head up to Prusik Pass.  We are now close to Prusik Peak and it had assumed its famous appearance as a jagged granite needle.  From the top of Prusik Pass we traversed the ridge to the base of Prusik Peak.  On the web site Mountainlessons.com I found a route description from some guys who also climbed Prusik in a day.  They included a route topo sketch.  The topo was helpful, but there was the strange mushroom shape at the start of the route.  I puzzled over that for a long time while planning the trip, but at the base of Prusik I discovered that it was a balanced rock looking like one of those European megalithic shelters.  We stashed our packs there and started the route.  It was Jason's first multi-pitch climb and my first year of leading trad.  Prior to taking the Boealps ICC my rock climbing was limited to single pitch top roped climbs and gym climbing.  I had never led or even followed, but by the end of the class I was leading 5.8 trad. Prusik Peak from Prusik Pass As seen from Prusik Pass the West Ridge looks like a very intimidating climb, but the closer you get to it the easier (the West Ridge at least) looks.  We were able to scramble the first third and we simul-climbed much of the rest.  Most of the route you stay a little below the ridge on the North side.  There were really only three short sections we had to pitch-out.  A lot of the route descriptions consider the unprotectable 5.7 slab about half of the way up the crux move.  I didn't think it was that bad.  You do have to take a deep breath and go for it, but it's very short, like ten feet, and there are some bomber handholds at the top of the slab.  I thought the final pitch to the summit was harder—the 5.6 layback flake and the 5.8 squeeze chimney were more challenging than the runout slab.  At the start of the climb I could hear people ahead of us on the route but I didn't realize it was people I knew, BOEALPSers Leigh and Laura.  They were there with a larger group who were camping, who we also managed to miss.  We started our climb at 1:30pm and Leigh and Laura were on the summit at 2:30pm so we just missed each other by a few hours. Fred Beckey and friends achieved the first summit of Prusik in 1948, traversing from the East to West along Temple Ridge.  In his 1969 memoir Challenge of the North Cascades he described how the then unnamed peak was christened: For 180 feet the spectacular route led up cracks to the ridge; some of this involved direct aid with pitons.  In a few awkward traverses and one short aid overhang we reached the base of the summit horn, here some 40 overhanging feet above.  We appraised several possibilities, and finally decided the quickest way would be to lasso the horn from an adjacent block.  Art climbed 20 feet, and with the spare 3/8-inch nylon began making looping throws.  Eventually he succeeded.  Now it was my turn: I tied three slings to the fixed rope with prusik knots and began to raise myself, lifting one sling at a time.  Getting over the last few feet was the worst part, for my weight made the loop slip around the overhanging anchor block.  ""Prusik Peak"", one of us volunteered.  The name stuck. The summit of Prusik Peak was a lot bigger and flatter than I was expecting.  You could fit a dozen people up there.  Popping out of the squeeze chimney I was stoked to realize I was on the summit.  The sweeping views of the Enchantments and Alpine Lakes Wilderness were fantastic.  I snapped a couple summit photos, but didn't have much time for celebrating.  It was five pm and we still had a long day still ahead of us before we got back to the car.  On the summit we met Vern and Tom who had just climbed Prusik via the difficult Stanley/Burgner South Face route.  Meeting them I felt a lot less badass for climbing the West Ridge in a day.  Those guys were also climbing Prusik in a day and they were climbing a much harder route with a lot more pitches.  They were not thru-hiking, as they started at the Stuart Lake Trailhead and were going to head back out the same way. Start of West Ridge Friction slab Looking down West Ridge Peak Views Summit Photo Tom made the excellent suggestion that we combine ropes for a double rope rappel.  The extra length of the rappels gained by tying our two ropes together meant we could rappel down the north face in three rappels instead of the five it would have taken us with a single rope.  The double rope rappel saved us a lot of valuable time.  There is a bolt at the summit and the guidebooks suggest rappelling from there, but it looked old and flimsy—I did not want to rappel off it.  There was a rappel station at the top of the chimney and that is where we started our descent.  I brought some extra sling because I was expecting to sacrifice a lot of my slings setting up our rappel anchors, but Prusik is a popular climb and there were so many slings (a lot of them recent) on all of the rappel stations that I ended up not using any of mine.  That said I'm still glad I brought the extra slings.  You never know what the tat is going to look like until you get there and I heard that occasionally rangers would remove all the old slings because they consider them litter. The Lower Enchantments from Prusik Peak Saying farewell to Tom and Vern we grabbed our gear from underneath the balanced rock and headed out. On our way out we passed the small pond known as Gnome Tarn that sits at the base of Prusik.  This is the classic view, the one that ends up on calendars and magazines.  The sun was low in the sky bathing everything in amber light, it was what photographers call the ""golden hour"" and I badly wanted to stop and take photos, but there was no time so I had to content myself with snapping a few quick parting shots. After about a mile brought, just east of Lake Viviane is where the steep boulder-strewn descent to Snow Lake begins.  Sunset was at 7:15pm and we really wanted to reach Snow Lake before dark.  It was almost 7pm when we started the descent and we picked our way down in the failing light.  We did not make it to the lake before dark descended, but at least we were past the boulder fields and on trail.  With headlights on we started the long slog out to the trailhead. Double rope rappel Old tat North Face Rappel Once you reach Snow Lake the hike out is long and boring.  The trail is good and descends gradually with but it's also monotonous.  The best part of the day was behind us and now we had four hours of trudging ahead of us before we could call it a day.  The hike out to the car is often the worst part of any climb.  You have achieved everything you set out to do and now you just want to go home, but you are still miles away from your car.  This is where Prusik-in-a-day turned into a death march.  Prior to the ICC my longest summit days had been sixteen hours, but the ICC with its twenty-two hour summit days pushed back the boundaries of what I thought I was physically capable of.  I was staggering down the trail like a zombie, but I knew I could keep going.  Of course Jason was ahead of me not tired at all, looking like he was just taking a casual stroll in the woods. Prusik Peak from Gnome Tarn On the hike out I had plenty of time with my thoughts, recalling other punishing one-day endurance suffer-fests I have subjected myself to.  In the summer of 2002 I signed up for the Seattle-to-Portland bicycle ride.  The spring of that same year I was a student in the Boealps Basic Climbing Class.  My experiences in the BCC and other mountaineering trips gave me the fortitude I would need on the ride to Portland.  The STP was hard, I rode the whole two hundred miles in one day, but mountaineering and especially the post-summit hikes out had taught me that I can always tough it out and keep going.  If you are fit enough, the rest is all about mental endurance. The other factor that kept me going on the STP was the knowledge that I had to get to Portland by a certain time or miss the bus back to Seattle.  I made it to Portland with only a ½ hour to spare.  That's what I call the ""Cortez burning his ships"" school of motivation—you have no choice but to keep going.  In mountaineering terms it is what you would call a ""committing"" climb.  That is, once you start it you have no options except to finish it. Whether choosing to do a ""committing"" climb means you should be wearing a climbing harness or a straight jacket is open to interpretation. Descent to Snow Lake Near the end the Snow Lake trail is cruel.  There's a point you reach where Icicle Creek Road is in sight.  You can see the headlights of passing cars and you think you're home free and almost to the car but in fact you are still about forty-five minutes to an hour away from the parking lot.  Finally we made it.  It was a little after midnight and we had been going non-stop for just under seventeen hours.  I was totally destroyed: my feet ached, my heels were covered with blisters, my calves were swollen from at least eight hornet stings, and I was nearly delirious with exhaustion.  That said, it was hardly the worst day ever, it was balmy warm and the sky was clear and full of stars. We had bivy gear in the car, but Jason was still good to drive so we headed back to Seattle.  I drifted in and out of consciousness on the drive home.  Jason picked me up at 4 AM Saturday morning and dropped me off at 3 AM Sunday morning for a total of twenty-three hours door-to-door.  It really was Prusik Peak in a day.

Tricams With apologies to AC/DC. When shopping for tricams a sales guy told me that there is a lot of debate about the pros & cons of tricams on Internet forums.  A criticism is that they can be hard to remove after being placed. On Prusik I found all the tricam sizes useful, but among tricam supporters on the Internet the pink tricam (½ inch size) is considered the most useful.  Doing my own research I stumbled across a Pink tricam true believer who even penned an ode to the pastel colored pro. Ode to a Pink Tricam Oh Pink's the one I love to place when I'm alone way up in space on some exposed and airy face. They sink where other gear won't go. When all you've got is manky pro, This tricam saves your butt from woe. But it's often hard to get them out; They make your second moan and shout And wave his nut tool 'round about But that's why you're the one on lead Your problems are a different breed As long as someone does the deed... ""Oh quit your whimpering,"" you rumble, ""And get it out or there'll be trouble"" ""Get to work now, on the double!"" Although it sometimes takes a while, They do come out with vim and guile, (or chiselling and curses vile.) Pink will do what all the rest. Won't do when they're put to the test.

Unfortunately, someone has posted literally over 40 trip reports in the past few days, and your trip report is already buried among the new submissions, and I'm afraid it may not get the notice and appreciation it deserves. When you're all done, you might consider saving it and then copying and pasting from the editing page as a new submission. I'd be happy to help you with that process since you're pretty new to the site and since, as one of the site admins, I know the tools and tricks pretty well. Anyway, I hope you might find this helpful, and keep up the great wok! LukeJennings - Dec 21, 2013 4:11 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Suggestion @Bob thanks the feedback and suggestions. I didn't re-post it because by the time I was finished I was ready to be done with it, as fun as it was to write. My target audience, in addition to friends and family, is anyone who is thinking about climbing the West Ridge in a day so hopefully they will find it by searching for Prusik. When I was planning this trip there was no single source of information that answered all my questions about climbing Prusik in a day, so one of my goals was to aggregate all the information I discovered during my own research to make it easier for others planning their own West Ridge climb.

single-day,https://www.summitpost.org/i-hate-that/818320,I Hate That,2012-09-30,"I Hate That<meta http-equiv=""content-type"" content=""text/html; charset=utf-8""> You know I hate that... You buy a permit for a tree farm so that you can bag all the peaks accessible within and from it and then the roads are still snowed under in Spring and then you have a medical problem for a month in mid-summer that hinders your ability to get those peaks then right after that a drought occurs and the farm’s management closes the farm for high fire danger and then you have to wait two more months (during the best time and weather of the year) to get access, meanwhile the weather could turn (with a vengeance) at any time and will probably do so right before the coming weekend and you might wind up wasting your $200. I hate that. You drive an old logging road that has rock debris on it from road bank sloughing. You’re going really slow to avoid every oil pan denter, but there’s always that one unseen rock blending in with the grassy center strip that you don’t see and…bang! I hate that. You come upon a brushy traverse as soon as you leave the comfort of a logging spur and then you remember/realize it’s late season, meaning the nightly dew has covered the brush with many beads of water that will soak you to the bone, and you purposely didn’t bring your rain pants to save weight even though they’re really lightweight. I hate that. You see open ground that avoids the brush, but when you get there you discover said open ground is marshy ground and your footsteps sink in up to the socks. That suck suck sucking boot sound…I hate that. You decide to avoid the brushy open areas by going to the forest, but every time you duck under an evergreen you get pine needles on your head and down your neck. I hate that. You realize really early in your day that your grand design to climb this peak and the two next door turns out to be just a flimsy papier-mâché version of your grand design. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Idiot. I hate that. You think you’ll take to a talus apron to bypass a brushy slope but the apron ends…at a brush wall…and now you’re 400 vertical feet lower down the mountain as a result and you’ve got the same amount of brush to deal with, only at a steeper angle now than if you had traversed the brush instead. I hate that. You try to take a brushy gully up a nasty, vegetated slope, and the first thing you encounter is devils club in the narrowest constriction. I hate that. You take a brushy gully up and have to green belay yourself up by holding on to the weakest thing implanted in the ground (fern) because everything else has little thorns on it and you’re too lazy to get your gloves out. I hate that. You are getting hot in your long sleeve sweater so take it off to climb up a nasty, brushy gully, but this exposes your short-sleeved arms to the brush and then the brush turns out to be mostly thorny salmonberry and devils club. I hate that. You decide to ascend a brushy gully because it looks like easier, open ground just a short way up. But after scratching and clawing (and being scratched and being clawed) up the gully, you discover the “easier ground” is in fact dangerous slabs. I hate that. You get up past a dangerous area, like brushy slabs, and see an easier way you were contemplating taking in the first place but didn’t because you didn’t want to climb too high too fast because you couldn’t see around the corner of the mountain rib up there where the other side might cliff out. But of course it didn’t. I hate that. You get up to a point just underneath the summit (but still 1000 ft below it) and the rock climbing there looks stellar but you’re too wimpy too free solo Class 5.10 so you have to continue traversing and traversing until you get to the easy way but that adds eight times the distance. I hate that. You finally get to the usual gully and think finally I’m on the normal route and can rest easy then you see a mountain goat climbing in the gully above you and now you have to worry about animal-induced rockfall. I hate that. You’re climbing up the usual gully which you have read from prior trip reports doesn’t require technical climbing with gear (i.e., it isn’t really hard and dangerous) and you encounter some Class 4 difficulties and wind up taking a harder route because you didn’t re-read the trip reports before you left the house and the harder route entails some groveling using grass tufts for veggie belaying (grass wasn’t meant for veggie belaying). I hate that. You get to the summit, which entails climbing through some Class 4 and exposure, and then see a clear view on a bluebird day. I love that. You scramble around the summit blocks eagerly looking for the register because recent prior trip reports have indicated there is one, but you can’t find it. I hate that. You look down from the summit to your car only a half-mile away and 1400 feet below and note that it took you 3 hours to go from there to here and there really wasn’t any rock climbing that would slow you down so what’s up with that? I hate that. You would like to shortcut the route back to your car by rappelling off that side of the mountain but you don’t a) have enough runners for rappel anchors, and b) would like to have had something longer than a 30m rope (meaning you’d be needing more runners), but you don’t. I hate that. You get back to the steep part of the usual gully and know you’re not going to downclimb the grassy tuft slabs so take to the woods to skier’s right and it is only then that you find the rappel anchor others have used and the reason you didn’t see it on the way up is because the runner color was the same as the tree it was wrapped around, so that’s why you wound up going up the other side of the gully up the grass tufts. I hate that. You get back to the “better way back” that avoids the steep, brushy gully and take the tailor-made ledge around the corner but then run into a dilemma: stay high on questionably narrowing ledges thence to a possible bushwhacking and cliffy nightmare or descend down (but lose elevation), which might avoid those aforementioned uncertainties, and you make a decision to do the latter based on the best available information (visuals) but then ironically wind up not only descending some questionable, narrowing ledges and then ending with a downhill with-the-grain bushwhack that features yet more sticker bushes. I hate that. You traverse back through the brushy forest thinking “I’ll just use those log highways I was using on the way up they ought to be right here” but you don’t find them (or all of them) because, well because where you are is shoulder-high bushwhacking and it doesn’t take much to get slightly off that track but you naturally see those log highways behind you after you pass them. I hate that. You wind up taking a lot of gear you didn't use, gear like crampons (for possible steep duff), ice axe (for possible steep duff), and runners (for rappelling) and all they do is weigh you down in your pack. I hate that. You get back to your car and there’s no Swedish bikini babe or babes waiting there to give you a...n ice cold beer. I hate that. You’re driving back down the logging road following a hunter in a pick-up truck and your cell phone pings to notify you have text messages and you pick it up to glance at the messages while you’re going 25 mph around a bend and when you look up a hotdogging Jeep is coming fast up the road and you see it just in time to veer to the right and then think, “what are the chances?” I hate that. Your arms are all scratched up and you look like a kitten has clawed at you all day and it hurt when the scratches were put on your arm. But then when you get home those scratches hurt you two more times: once when the hot water hits you in the shower and then again only minutes later when you towel dry your arms. I hate that. You do a climb like this and you’re solo meaning there’s no one with you to share in your memories (especially the bad ones). I hate that. You get home and want to write a trip report but have writer’s block because you don’t want to write another run-of-the-typer-mill report and then you’re also a busy working and family man and so you’re delayed then people start asking you for information and you’re forced to write something you may hate. But nonetheless the whole time you’re hiking back to the car or driving home you’re writing lines in your head thinking “that’s good stuff” and that you’ll put that onto paper as soon as you get home but you don’t (because you’re busy, remember) and so by the time you really get around to writing it none of those good lines you can remember (like not being able to remember a dream too long after you wake up). I hate that. You want to go climbing in the tree farm the following weekend but they close it for fire danger AGAIN so you’re forced to do something else…like write a hateful trip report. I hate that. --Paul Klenke, October 2012 Test: Α - Α - Greek capital Alpha α - α - Greek lower case alpha Β - Β - Greek capital Beta β - β - Greek lower case beta Γ - Γ - Greek capital Gamma γ - γ - Greek lower case gamma Δ - Δ - Greek capital Delta δ - δ - Greek lower case delta Ε - Ε - Greek capital Epsilon ε - ε - Greek lower case epsilon Ζ - Ζ - Greek capital Zeta ζ - ζ - Greek lower case zeta Η - Η - Greek capital Eta η - η - Greek lower case eta Θ - Θ - Greek capital Theta θ - θ - Greek lower case theta Ι - Ι - Greek capital Iota ι - ι - Greek lower case iota Κ - Κ - Greek capital Kappa κ - κ - Greek lower case kappa Λ - Λ - Greek capital Lamda λ - λ - Greek lower case lamda Μ - Μ - Greek capital Mu μ - μ - Greek lower case mu Ν - Ν - Greek capital Nu ν - ν - Greek lower case nu Ξ - Ξ - Greek capital Xi ξ - ξ - Greek lower case xi Ο - Ο - Greek capital Omicron ο - ο - Greek lower case omicron Π - Π - Greek capital Pi π - π - Greek lower case pi Ρ - Ρ - Greek capital Rho ρ - ρ - Greek lower case rho Σ - Σ - Greek capital Sigma σ - σ - Greek lower case sigma ς - ς - Greek lower case final sigma Τ - Τ - Greek capital Tau τ - τ - Greek lower case tau Υ - Υ - Greek capital Upsilon υ - υ - Greek lower case upsilon Φ - Φ - Greek capital Phi φ - φ - Greek lower case phi Χ - Χ - Greek capital Chi χ - χ - Greek lower case chi Ψ - Ψ - Greek capital Psi ψ - ψ - Greek lower case psi Ω - Ω - Greek capital Omega ω - ω - Greek lower case omega Images View I Hate That Image Gallery - 24 Images Comments Post a Comment Viewing: 1-6 of 6 WebTraveler - Oct 7, 2012 11:31 pm - Voted 10/10 I love that!

I can't climb them/don't want to b/c of smoke). All the other ones are in the N Cascades and require at least 3 days. Looks like I have a problem until the fires go away.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/mount-daniel-in-two-days/955013,Mount Daniel in Two Days,2015-09-12,"PLANNING Cathedral Rock from the RoadI don’t get the opportunity for overnight trips much anymore, but I wanted to make sure I got one good trip in this year.  I had planned on doing Mount Constance on the Olympic Peninsula around Labor Day, but poor weather forced me to cancel those plans.  I decided to go the following weekend but for some reason Constance was seeming less appealing for no reason in particular, just a feeling.  I was being drawn to another destination on my list…  Mt. Daniel in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness!  I’ve found that when it comes to the mountains it’s best to listen to your gut instinct, whether it’s turning around due to weather or poor conditions or deciding which line to take when route finding, I’ve never been let down by listening to my gut.  This time as no exception! Mount Daniel is roughly 15 miles and 5000 ft elevation gain round trip via the SE ridge so it can be done in one day.  One long day, you know the kind where the last couple hours your feet are sore and your legs are tired and you wish you were back at the car already.  In my research for the trip a lot of people who did this one in a day said if they had to do it over again they would do it in two days.  This was good incentive for me to make this one an over nighter.  On those long one day trips I’m usually go, go, go light and fast sometimes pushing myself to get up or down the trail as fast as I can comfortably go.  Doing this in two days my plan was to take it slow and luxuriate in nature along the way, certainly a change of pace for me.  DAY ONE I had accumulated a bunch of new gear over the last few years for backpacking, but had not really had the opportunity to use it so I was excited to pack my new pack and see how much it weighed.  After getting it fully packed, including 2L of water, it weighed in at 27 pounds!  I was thrilled!  I don’t think I’ve ever had an overnight pack less than 40 pounds so I was pretty excited about this.  I set my alarm for 4:00, got up, hit the road, and made it to the trailhead around 8:00.  I pulled into the last available parking space at the Cathedral Pass Trailhead, threw on my pack and hit the trail.  My pack felt great!  I’ve never been so comfortable backpacking, it didn’t feel much different than a day pack.  I made my way up the well graded switchbacks taking my time and going a bit slower than my usual pace.  As I neared the ridge and Squaw Lake I heard some noise behind me.  An animal?  Deer perhaps?  I turned around and saw… a coupe hikers!  I honestly can’t remember ever being passed on a trail with the exception of hiking with the family or an occasional trail runner.  This was an unusual occurrence for me, but I moved to the side so they could pass without breaking stride.  It was a guy and a girl, the girl said hi and thanks while the guy was silent.  I would see them again later in the day. Fall Colors Along the Trail Fall Colors and Dehydrated Tarn Cathedral Rock Squaw Lake was a nice little spot.  I took a couple pictures and continued up the trail.  This was where things started to get good.  Fall colors were out and the morning sun was illuminating the foliage in a warm light.  I continued up the trail where the first views of Cathedral Rock greeted me.  Man, what a pretty chunk of rock!  In the early morning light the rock looked silver with streaks of lime green.  Combine that with the fall colors, cool weather, and a comfy pack and it was about as good as it gets on the trail in!  Shortly later I was passed by another solo hiker but it felt good to just meander up the trail rather than charge hard.  I reached the PCT and shortly later the trail to Peggy’s Pond.  After navigating the somewhat cliffy sections of the trail I reached the small basin below Peggy’s Pond where the solo hiker who had passed me was filling up his water and chatting with another solo hiker.  The trail split and I took the wrong path so I bushwhacked a little to get to the right one before reaching Peggy’s Pond.  It was nice.  There were no campers at all which surprised me a little given that this is supposed to be a popular spot.  There were a couple guys having breakfast by the lake, but I cruised by passing several open camp sites in search of something a little more secluded.   I had heard about a camp spot on the ridge above Peggy’s Pond so I hiked up there to look around but I wasn’t satisfied with the views so I descended into the basin to Hyas Creek.  There were a few lovely camp sites here, and I almost took one, but instead I hiked up the creek and around a bend to where Hyas Creek runs north to south and found a large flat rocky area a short distance from the creek that had views of Mount Daniel and Cathedral Rock so I decided to make my camp here.  After setting up camp, having lunch, filling up on water, and relaxing about an hour and a half I was ready for the push to the summit! First Camp - Cathedral Rock Mount Daniel and Hyas Creek Glacier Being a fair bit north of the traditional SE ridge route, I started my ascent with a scramble up the NE slopes of the SE ridge.  This proved to be quite a bit of fun as the terrain was rocky with some rather large slabs to scramble up.  Further up the ridge here was a lot of talus and scree around the larger more stable rocks just to add some spice to the terrain.  At this point it was getting pretty hot and I took advantage of a few cliffs that were tall enough to cast a shadow to provide some shade to rest in for a bit.  Eventually I reached the ridge proper where I was greeted by stunning views of Circle Lake.  I continued up the ridge admiring the views until I reached the gendarme section.  Here I came across the solo hiker who had passed me on the trail in. He was on his way down and had some helpful advice for passing the scramble section.  It wasn’t too bad, pretty easy scrambling.  Soon Venus and Spade Lakes came into view as well as Bears Breast and the Chief grouping as well as the rock garden of Chimney Rock and Lemah.  It was absolutely beautiful! Circle Lake and Mount Daniel Venus and Spade Lakes When I got to the base of the east summit it was time for the traverse over to the true summit.  There are reports of this section being horrible, terrifying even, but I found these reports to be inaccurate at least for me.  Sure the terrain is steep scree which is not ideal, but if you are sure footed and used to this type of terrain it is a piece of cake although there are a few sections where you must go slow and step carefully.  When you start the route the trail leads to a small rocky cliffy area.  It looks like the trail goes up, which I took on the way up, but there is also a trail at the base of the rock, which I took on the way down.  The low route is the way to go.  Part way across the traverse I ran into the couple who had passed me early in the day.  They confirmed the low route is best, complimented my on my approach shoes (Salewa Wildfire), and we parted ways.  Once across the traverse there is a horrible section of loose talus and scree to scramble up before reaching the final summit block which is a quick scramble.  Success!!!  The summit was amazing and fairly clear.  There was some haze to the NW, but the rest of the views were spectacular.  I signed the register and spent about 30-40 minutes on the summit admiring the views before heading back.  Mount Daniel West Summit Mount Daniel East Summit Lynch Glacier Mount Daniel East Summit and Enchantments The route back to below the east summit was unremarkable.  As I started my descent of the SE ridge there were a couple guys starting a descent of the Hyas Creek Glacier and headwall.  As I made my way down the ridge I would glance back to check their progress.  They were moving slow, very slow.  I was half way down the ridge and they were not even to the glacier yet.  They looked like they were having some trouble with the terrain and I worried about them but it looked like they were trying to traverse south to gain the SE ridge.  I hope they made it out without any difficulty.  Mount Daniel Summit Panorama Sun was setting as I descended and shadows crept down the valley towards my camp.  I spotted my tent from high on the ridge and noticed a pond right above where I had set up my tent.  I left the trail and scrambled down the NE slopes of the SE ridge through some fun terrain of rocks, boulders, and slabs before I reached the Hyas Creek basin and my camp.  I hiked up a small hill above my camp to check out the pond and found a sloping rock where a stone wind shelter for cooking had been built and a flat spot on a rock slab just big enough for a tent.  Sweet!  This was a much better spot, so I just picked up my tent with all my stuff in it and carried it up the hill and made my camp up there.  The evening was amazing.  I had some pu erh tea, made a mountain house for dinner, and watched the last light of the day creep up and over Cathedral Rock as I relaxed and took photos.  As I lounged around I felt like something was missing and then I realized… there were no bugs!  Not a single one!  This area is renowned for being very buggy.  Nearly every trip report mentions bugs at Peggy’s Pond but I suspect a freeze the previous week had killed them as there was not a one and my bug spray stayed in my pack all trip.  Awesome!  At night Mount Daniel looked like a fat man lying on his back gazing at the stars.  There was quite a bit of wind which kept me awake, but eventually I fell asleep and slept well.  My new 20 degree bag was a tad hot, I’d guess it only got down to the 40s.   Cathedral Rock and Tarn Cathedral Rock Tarn Reflection Camp in Hyas Creek Basin DAY TWO Cathedral Rock Reflection in the Morning In the morning I ate some oatmeal before packing up and hitting the trail.  I made my way back past Peggy’s Pond to where the trail reached the PCT.  Here I made a little mistake.  My phone with GPS had died and the computer I tried to print a topo on wouldn’t print for some reason so I said forget it, I’ll just use my phone. Well I won’t be doing that again.  As I was taking the trail down I reached a switchback and thought, that’s funny I don’t remember this but I kept going.  I passed a solo female hiker and a few more switchbacks and after about 30 minutes I decided I had taken a wrong turn somewhere.  I marched back up the switchbacks and caught up with the solo hiker who confirmed that I was on the PCT but going the wrong way.  This little mishap added 2+ miles to my day which I was not happy about but a safe way to learn a valuable lesson.  A couple of left ankle rolls and some sore feet later I reached my car.  It was an amazing trip, one I won’t soon forget!

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/from-a-slide-to-tye-a-2012-retrospective/832469,From A Slide To Tye: A 2012 Retrospective,2012-01-01,"FOREWORDI typically do not dwell on the past. I am a person who tends to look forward to the future. However, because 2012 was my most successful peakbagging year to date, I wanted to reflect on those experiences and share some of them with other people. During 2012, I reached more summits, gained more cumulative elevation, and hiked more peakbagging miles than I ever have previously done in any single year. In fact, as a person who has an active schedule which includes family, work, and non-peakbagging hobbies (yes, those exist!), I doubt at this point that I will ever improve upon those single-year personal peakbagging achievements. During 2012, there were many great trips and few dull moments. My peakbagging year started with a trip in which I was caught in an avalanche. My peakbagging year reached its midpoint with a trip in which I achieved a major peakbagging accomplishment. My peakbagging year ended with a trip in which I got to (finally) relax and enjoy fantastic views of a region very sentimental to me. I was able to do peakbagging and highpointing across different regions of the USA, in the Northwest, Southwest, Northeast, and Southeast. I even summited my first peak outside of my home country. Not all of the trips and destinations were exciting, and few will probably make the list of my favorite summits of all-time, but I will view this year in its entirety. 2012 was a year during which I achieved things that only a few years ago seemed distant. It was a year I will treasure for the rest of my life. JANUARY, NOTABLE SUMMIT TRIPSThe year did not start as planned, but if anything it was a wake-up call to always expect the unexpected. As part of a personal effort to continue exercising even during the dreary Winter months of the Great Northwest, my friend Bryan and I decided to go on a local snowshoe trip together on New Year’s Day. With what seemed like a favorable weather forecast and low avalanche danger, we chose low-elevation peaks Scout Patrol Peak and Little Saint Helens as our destinations. The two peaks seemed like good options because snow-covered forest roads could be used for much of the trip, with minimal shortcuts and off-road travel necessary if desired. As we ascended a steep slope to a forest road several hundred feet above us, I stopped several times to probe the slope (as I often do on steep snowy terrain). Despite the low elevation and low regional avalanche danger forecasted, it never hurts to take a few extra moments to check slope stability. Everything seemed OK, and we made it to the top of the slope to the forest road without incident. Our trip and route were working very well for us, and we were making great time. Bryan Ascends Soon-To-Be Avalanche Slope... However, shortly thereafter, as we walked along the non-wind-loaded side of the road I watched as a crack quickly formed around Bryan’s feet, sweeping him down the slope. Then, without time to react, where the crack stopped its circle around him suddenly started a new crack around me. To give an analogy, my visual of the occurrence was as if snowy boogie boards were carrying us down the mountain and we were suddenly in a “wave” of sorts. Fortunately, we each remained calm and talked with each other while “swimming” on top of the slide. The minor avalanche was wide but fortunately not deep. It swept us both down several hundred feet, but except for some minor bruises we were both OK. That evening, we worked with the Northwest Avalanche Center (NWAC) to report the incident and determine the cause of the avalanche despite our observations that danger was not imminent. But sometimes nature wins despite caution being used. The official NWAC incident report is available online. In the middle of the month, I organized a group to snowshoe up Arrowhead Mountain, which was my first 6000’+ summit of the year and first-ever 6000’+ summit in the month of January. At the end of the month, I visited some relatives in Arizona and used the opportunity to summit several mountains, including peaks with 2000’ of prominence and county highpoints. I was surprised to find Mount Lemmon drivable up to the gate located at 8350’, a feat which could never be acomplished in Washington. The following morning, I hiked up Harquahala Mountain, which was my favorite peak of the trip. I really enjoyed the solitude I found while hiking the peak, and the weather and scenery was much better than I anticipated. At The Mount Lemmon Summit... View From The Harquahala Mountain Summit... FEBRUARY, NOTABLE SUMMIT TRIPSMy first summit trip in February was as part of a group of snowshoers and skiers going to Mount Angeles, in the Olympics Range. Mount Angeles is a very popular hiking destination, so I was amazed to be a part of 12 notable climbers who had never previously summited the peak. We enjoyed great weather and great views all day, and when our group reached the summit we all celebrated the birthday of one of the climbers. I created a short video for the trip. Mount Angeles How To Celebrate A Birthday... In the middle of the month, I ventured to Anaconda Peak, an obscure mountain near the Mountain Loop Highway. This was not a fun solo trip, as the mixed dirt/snow-covered forest duff continually slipped beneath my feet and the weather left much to be desired. The best part of the trip was meeting a local resident who lived near the entrance to the access road, while the peak joined my “one and done” list. MARCH, NOTABLE SUMMIT TRIPSMy first summit trip in March was a trip to Ironstone Mountain involving three other local peakbaggers. This would be my first-ever trip with local peakbagger Paul Klenke, something which I had looked forward to for some time. We had great weather and some spare time, so Paul and his friend Stefan had us do some “dumpster dive” peakbagging to finish the day’s events. Paul Klenke On Ironstone Summit... My final summit trip of the month was a side-trip I took while visiting friends in the Tri-Cities region of Washington. I visited Washtucna Benchmark, which Paul (Klenke) had speculated might be a contender for the highest point in Franklin County, Washington. I had previously expressed to him my apprehension at such an assertion, and my findings at the highpoint area confirmed (at least to me) that Washtucna Benchmark is definitely not the county highpoint. Why Am I Even Here? :-) APRIL, NOTABLE SUMMIT TRIPSI was a part of several fun trips in April. My favorite of those trips was a snowshoe trip I organized for Lennox Mountain, a 2000’ prominence peak located in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness of Washington. Several of the group members doubted that the route I had chosen (via Coney Creek) would be successful, but the route worked very well for us. One of the highlights of the trip was when our friend Micheal (a.k.a. “Jimbopo”) caught up to us midway during the ascent. His expedition involved arriving too late at the meetup location, then running (literally) too far off our route, and then backtracking and running (literally) up our route… and he had started on our route approximately 1.5 hours after we had! I wrote a trip report for the experience. East Ridge Of Lennox Mountain I Call This View ""Snow Pillows"" Group Photo At Lennox Summit Later that month, I also determined a new summit route for Storm King Mountain, a mid-elevation 2000’ prominence peak. I also did a solo snowshoeing trip up Crystal Mountain, near Mount Rainier, for which I worked closely with the ski resort personnel to make the trip happen and also gave me a good opportunity to try different non-emergency features of my SPOT device. Storm King Mountain MAY, NOTABLE SUMMIT TRIPSThe month of May started with one of my favorite trips of the year. My childhood home was not far from Mount Index, so it had been a goal of mine for a long time to summit the peak. “Gimpilator” and I had previously attempted and failed on the peak, timing-out, and we wondered if the snow conditions on the mountain would cooperate on our second visit. We invited a solid group of climbers to join us and also had some luck. We hit the right snow conditions at the right times we needed them, and the trip was a success. “Gimpilator” wrote a brief trip report about the experience. My Steep Ascent On Mount Index (Photo By ""Gimpilator"") Near The Summit Of Mount Index (Photo By ""Gimpilator"") Our Team On Index Summit (Photo By ""Gimpilator"") The month ended with a Memorial Day weekend trip to eastern Washington, some parts of which were solo and some parts of which were shared with “Gimpilator” and Paul Klenke. I was able to summit nine peaks that weekend, six of which had fire lookouts. The weather was taking a turn for the worse on the west side of the Cascade Mountains, so we were each able to accomplish a lot more peakbagging on the east side of the Cascade Mountains, as a result. ""Gimpilator"" and Paul Klenke On Funk Mountain JUNE, NOTABLE SUMMIT TRIPSThe first half of June was amongst the most frustrating times of the year for me. After nearly two months of great mountaineering weather, most of the Northwest was ravaged by lingering storms for nearly all of June. Although I was able to go out on some minor trips early during the month, I continued to wait patiently for the right weather, conditions, and mountaineering partners to join me for an attempt of my biggest goal of the year: Mount Baker. Finally, on June 19, the weather forecast looked to be favorable for approximately the next 24-36 hours. “Gimpilator” and I quickly took the following day off from our respective jobs, assembled two other mountaineers (Joe & Jeremy), and that night began what would become a non-stop, 18-hour, 7500’+ gain trip up and down Mount Baker. We chose the Easton Glacier route, and we lucked-out with weather and conditions. Not only were we successful, it marked my simultaneous completion of the Washington County Highpoints, Washington County Prominence Points, and Washington 25-Miles Isolation lists. It also was my 100th USA peak with at least 2000’ of prominence. “Gimpilator” wrote a trip report, and I wrote a trip report, too. I also created a summit video. Approaching The Mount Baker Summit... ""Gimpilator"" And I ""The Baker"" With my major peakbagging list goals for Washington now complete, I immediately set my eyes on other goals in other regions. At the end of the month, while poor weather still plagued the Northwest (but seemed better further south), I drove to southwest Oregon to summit several county highpoints and prominence points. The most notable of those peaks was Grayback Mountain, the Josephine County highpoint, which, despite a poor-quality road and even worse weather, I summited within 1.5 hours. Steep Meadow Slopes On Grayback JULY, NOTABLE SUMMIT TRIPSJuly started where June left off… in southwestern Oregon. On July 1, I successfully summited Pearsoll Peak, the most prominent point in Josephine County. But it was a pre-hike incident, and not the hike itself, which was most memorable. I was basically chased off from a standard approach (via McCaleb Ranch) for the mountain before I even got to begin. A man at the ranch homestead did not like me being there despite a ranger previously telling me that I could be there, and even after I moved myself and my vehicle to a different location… as instructed by the man at the ranch, no less… he still sent two of his assistants to my parking area. I suspect that they were either going to damage my car or harass me, but I did not give them much opportunity to do so. I soon left and headed for another route approach (Kalmiopsis Rim Trail), which might have been a better choice, anyway. I mention the incident in my SummitPost Climber’s Log. Looking Down At McCaleb Ranch Pearsoll At Sunrise Later during the month, I returned to Oregon for more peakbagging. This trip was even more ambitious than the previous one. In nearly four days’ time, I had driven almost 1600 miles roundtrip, hiked over 58 miles total, achieved nearly 19,000’ of cumulative elevation gain, and summited seven peaks. All seven mountains were Top 100 peaks in Oregon and 2000’ prominence peaks. Those mountains also included six county highpoints, six county prominence points, four wilderness highpoints, and one national park highpoint. My favorite summit during that trip was Mount Thielsen. Mount Thielsen Mount Thielsen - Upper West Ridge Less than one week later, to finish the month, I visited Utah and Nevada on another peakbagging trip. The trip began with a one-day, 28.5-mile ascent of Kings Peak, the Utah state highpoint and my 42nd state highpoint reached overall. I then drove overnight to Nevada, where I summited two more high-elevation peaks. I then drove back to Utah and summited Mount Nebo, the third-most isolated and fifth-most prominent point in the state. Kings Peak Summit View Wheeler Peak (NV) Mount Nebo AUGUST, NOTABLE SUMMIT TRIPSAfter I returned back to Washington, I took some time to spend with family rather than outdoor adventures. By the middle of the month I found myself returning to a peak that I did not know if I would ever return: Mount Buckner. I usually do not repeat peaks which I have already summited, unless given an opportunity which did not present itself during the first visit(s). In the case of Mount Buckner, I wanted to help a fellow peakbagger, Adam Helman, get one step closer to finishing the Washington county highpoints. It also would give me an opportunity to visit the northeast peak of Mount Buckner, a hilltop which some people believe is the highest point of the mountain while most others (myself included) believe is just a lower sub-summit location. Due to a late dinner commitment elsewhere, I was not able to join my friends Adam, Bob Bolton, and Duane Gilliland up to Sahale Glacier Camp during the same day as them. So instead, after dinner, I drove to the Cascade Pass trailhead in the middle of the night, slept 2-3 hours, and then met-up with my friends (much to their surprise) by 6:30 AM. I helped alleviate Adam’s concerns about a steep downclimb of a snow finger to enter Horseshoe Basin by leading the team down a different way. When Adam eventually reached the summit of Mount Buckner, Duane and I asked him if he wanted to join us for an ascent of the northeast peak. Adam, looking over towards the northeast peak and deducing (as many of us already had) that the southwest peak is the higher point, opted to not join Duane and I for an ascent of the northeast peak. When Duane and I reached our destination for the trip, our opinions had not changed; if anything, we both believed more strongly than ever that the northeast peak was the lower of the two Buckner peaks and not worth other parties visiting in the future. But that is a choice left for each person to decide. What I Think Of Buckner's NE Peak What Duane Thinks Of Buckner's NE Peak Near the end of the month I joined two other friends, Edward Earl and Eric Noel, for an ascent of South Twin, a 2000’ prominence peak near Mount Baker. Edward, “Gimpilator”, and I failed on an attempt two years earlier due to timing-out but we learned a lot about the terrain on that trip. “Gimpilator” made a successful second attempt less than one week prior to Edward, Eric, and I making our attempt together. His beta gave us an extra confidence boost heading into the trip. Edward and I headed up together and met Eric soon after leaving the access road. Edward and I each bivied under the stars that night, while Eric tent-camped. We left early the next morning and arrived at the summit of South Twin approximately four hours later. The rock type on the route was excellent for scrambling; rough and solid enough to allow good grips and movement. It was a nice feeling to get another previously-failed attempt off of my “to do” list. Eric wrote a brief trip report about the experience. Group Photo On South Twin Summit SEPTEMBER, NOTABLE SUMMIT TRIPSSeptember began with a 6000’ gain trip up Big Chiwaukum, a 2000’ prominence peak in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Rather than do the trip as an overnighter, as most people do, my friend Greg Slayden and I decided to do the 17-mile roundtrip journey as a single-day ascent. The trip involved a combination of maintained trails, open country navigation, and classic Cascade scrambling. We enjoyed great views and weather, and the jaunt was not as bad as some might indicate. Greg wrote a trip report about the experience. Greg Ascends Big Chiwaukum My biggest trip of the month, however, was a six-day trip to the northeastern USA. My main objective was to complete the five remaining state highpoints I had in that region, and also use any extra time to focus on other county highpoints. I took a “red-eye” flight from Seattle to Boston, and immediately drove west to Mount Greylock, the Massachusetts state highpoint. As I approached the summit, the weather quickly deteriorated; horrendous rain and wind was everywhere, nearly knocking me down. After Mount Greylock, I drove southwest towards Slide Mountain, the 25th-most isolated point in the contiguous USA. The weather was even worse there than at Mount Greylock but, if anything, that made my ascent quicker by taking fewer breaks. While driving north towards my next destination, Mount Marcy, I stopped at a gas station near Albany and found out from the cashier that several tornadoes had formed near the areas I had just been in earlier that day. I was shocked to hear the news yet thankful I was unscathed. At The Mount Greylock Summit I hiked Mount Marcy, the New York state highpoint, the next morning. I added nearby Phelps Mountain as a quick side-trip during my descent. I was hoping to cram in Mount Mansfield, the Vermont state highpoint, later that day but was not able to catch an early enough ferry to arrive before the entrance gate closed. As poor weather patterns continued to follow me for the entire first half of my trip, I chose not to do a long hike up Mount Mansfield. Instead, I found a preferrable car-camping site nearby and then was the first person up the mountain the next morning. I visited the summit as well as a nearby sub-summit which is the adjacent county’s highest point. The thick fog on top of the mountain prevented me from seeing any views, but that seemed to be the common theme for the first half of my trip. Approaching The Mount Marcy Summit At The Mount Mansfield Summit Later that day, I visited Mount Washington, the New Hampshire state highpoint. Most of my friends had said to hike to the top of Mount Washington, but a storm system and my tight schedule caused me to re-evaluate my options. I instead chose to drive to the top parking lot and hike from there. As I neared the summit, I was being hit by strong winds, rain, and hail. The temperature dropped rapidly, reaching near-freezing levels. I first took a brief visit (i.e. refuge) at the gift shop, which other people were also doing. Soon, however, I found myself being the only one choosing to continue to the true summit. The wind gusts changed from 60 MPH to near-hurricane force within 10-15 minutes. I made a brief video as I approached the summit, and then had to retreat to the doorway of a nearby building for a few minutes before returning to take some summit photos. Then, in an effort to try to get “perfect” summit photos, I got knocked down several times and felt like a human pinball machine. The biggest mistake I made was wearing jean shorts in the rain and wind, which further enhanced my shivers in the cold. At The Mount Washington Summit I then continued driving east to Maine, where I hiked Katahdin the following morning (September 11). Although this would be my fifth and final state highpoint in the northeastern USA and 47th overall, what I will remember most about visiting Katahdin is watching numerous completers of the Appalachian Trail arrive shortly after I reached the summit. Katahdin was hands-down my favorite hike and peak of the entire trip, and I even made a short video. At The Katahdin Summit I spent the remaining 2-1/2 days of my trip driving through Main, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, focusing on county highpoints along the way. During that timeframe, I completed the county highpoints in Rhode Island. As a personal fun-fact, my first statewide county highpoint completion was Washington, my 100th County Highpoint was Washington County in Oregon, and my second statewide County Highpoint completion occurred at Washington County in Rhode Island... I guess I am just a true Washingtonian in my heart. I also got an opportunity during the trip to visit with the Worcester Sharks AHL team's front office and pick-up a game-worn hockey jersey for my wife as a ""thank you"" for allowing me to go on the trip. In total, I had driven over 2000 miles and reached 18 county highpoints (including the five previously-mentioned state highpoints). It was a very successful trip. Celebrating Final CoHP Of Trip: Holt Hill (Essex CoHP) However, my favorite trip of September, and one of my top two favorite trips of the year (with Mount Baker being the other), was an ascent of Silvertip Mountain in British Columbia. Silvertip Mountain has the distinction of being the closest Canadian “Ultra” (i.e. peak with at least 5000’ of clean prominence) to the USA border, as well as being the most prominent non-volcanic peak in the entire Cascade Range. It was to be my first-ever ascent of a peak outside of the USA, and I had wanted to summit the peak for several years. I had researched several routes for the peak and even helped to organize a trip the previous year, but had to back out of the trip due to a combination of poor weather and other commitments. The people who continued with that trip ultimately failed during their attempt due to poor snow/ice conditions on the peak. For my attempt in late September, I was accompanied by Martin Shetter, who had been on the previous year's failed attempt. But unlike the previous year's attempt on a north route with sketchy terrain, we were going to make an attempt via a more straightforward south route. In our circle of peakbagging friends, little firsthand knowledge was known about the south approach, but we were confident that our research and abilities would ultimately lead us to success. Silvertip Mountain We car-camped at our starting location and then ascended the peak the following morning. Desipte a few occasional ribbons on trees, the entire route had no trail system. To compound things further, the south approach gained a hefty 6700’ in only 3.5 miles from car to summit. Fortunately, we both had maps and GPS devices, and most of the route followed ridgelines. Upon reaching the summit, I took the opportunity to wear “Silvertips” gear and hold a “Silvertips” flag, as a reference to a Northwest hockey team. All things considered, the antics seemed appropriate for a peak sharing a similar name. Martin wrote a trip report about the experience. Martin Approaches The Silvertip Summit... Silvertip Mania! OCTOBER, NOTABLE SUMMIT TRIPSThe first trips of October were about Bald Eagles and re-attempts. First, I summited Bald Eagle Peak, a mountain which I had failed on 2-1/2 years earlier. During the ascent, I slipped and briefly dislocated one of my shoulders during the trip, but after “popping” it back into place I continued to the summit. Several days later, I summited Bald Eagle Mountain, a peak which I had failed on 1-1/2 years earlier. Most of the route was on trails, but the final steep off-trail ascent to the summit required usage of “veggie belays” on heather and huckleberry shrubs… which had me concerned that a slip might reinjure my hurt shoulder. Fortunately, I never slipped and I successfully reached the summit. Approaching Bald Eagle Peak... Huckleberries & Heather On Bald Eagle Mountain However, my most memorable trip in October was going to Orcas Island to see my friend, Dennis Poulin, complete the Washington county highpoints. He completed his goal on 10/13, a date which seemed fitting because I was the 10th completer and he was the 13th completer, as well as I was the first completer of the Washington county highpoints that year and he was the last completer. Dennis was accompanied by fellow completers Bob Bolton, Duane Gilliland, Edward Earl, and I… the largest group of previous finishers to witness a person’s completion of the Washington county highpoints… as well as several wives and Ken Russell (who was in the process of working on the Washington county highpoints list). One of my favorite moments of the trip was during our post-summit dinner, during which time Bob told the story of how he had met Dennis. I recorded a video of the tale. Gathering Of Some WA CoHP Completers NOVEMBER, NOTABLE SUMMIT TRIPSI only took two hiking trips in November, one short and one long. The first trip of the month was at Hogback Mountain, a peak with almost 2000’ of prominence located near White Pass in Washington. The mountain is easily accessible from near a ski area, and for me I was able to make a more direct ascent route due to fresh snowpack in the area. No snowshoes were required, but it was still a 10-mile roundtrip jaunt in a remote area. The second trip of November was definitely longer, and perhaps more notable. I drove down to Oregon for the weekend, but I found out during the trip that my wife would be meeting me at the tail-end of the trip to see the new baby of some friends in Portland. This caused me to ramp-up my peakbagging efforts with little extra time to spare, starting with the lone Oregon county highpoint I still needed in northwestern Oregon. The first summits I visited were the Lincoln County highpoint (which has no official name) and the possible highpoint contender on nearby Saddle Bag Mountain. The access to both locations is similar, although the logging company maintaining the access roads in the area had a new rule being enforced. Non-motorized access started much further from my two peak destinations than people had experienced in previous hunting seasons, making my trip be 21 miles rather than 13 miles roundtrip. Fortunately, I had brought my bicycle with me which greatly decreased my ascent and descent times. However, I also got a lot of strange looks from hunters I passed during the trip, and those whom I spoke with were irritated with the new non-motorized access restrictions in the area. At the conclusion of the two-peak trip, I believed that the western highpoint contender (on Saddle Bag Mountain) might actually be slightly higher than the eastern contender, but I have no firm proof of that assertion and I leave that opinion for each person to decide. I wrote a brief trip report. At Eastern HP Contender For Lincoln County After finishing the two-peak county highpoint portion of my trip, I headed north and finished the day with a quick ascent up Firebreak Peak, a low-elevation (but high prominence) mountain located only a few miles from another county highpoint which I had visited only one year prior. After car-camping that night, I did an early morning hike/bike trip up West Onion Peak, the most prominent point in Clatsop County and my final county prominence point completed in northwestern Oregon. After completing my trip for West Onion Peak, I drove eastward to Portland, stopping at several minor peaks along the way which I found on my road atlas. My favorite of those minor peaks was Mount Tabor, the only volcano in the USA located completely within the boundaries of a major city (Portland). DECEMBER, NOTABLE SUMMIT TRIPSDecember started with a group trip to Red Top Mountain, a peak located in the eastern Teanaway region of Washington. Due to snow-covered roads and gated roads preventing our car from any upper access to the standard hiking routes, we opted to try a more direct off-season route via Medicine Creek. The route worked very well, as a combination of open country and snow-covered trails. Despite the snowpack, enough snow had melted in recent days that snowshoes were not necessary. Our group was rewarded with some great views at the summit, which also had a fire lookout building as an additional reward. This was our first-ever trip with a new peakbagging friend, Natasha Walker, who would soon decide to join my friend “Gimpilator” on a trip to Nepal during Spring 2013. Approaching Red Top Mountain... Two days after the Red Top Mountain trip, my work sent me to the southeastern USA for a couple of weeks. During the second half of the trip I was sent to Orlando, and during the one day I had off from work during that timeframe I decided to summit several local county highpoints in the surrounding area. They were basically lame “peaks” (and I use that term loosely), but they still brought my overall total county highpoints to 145 and one of the peaks (Sugarloaf Mountain) is the 12th-most isolated point in the contiguous USA. I finished the month, and the year, on two trips with my new peakbagging friend, Natasha. While “Gimpilator” was out of Washington for several weeks, in his absence I decided to try to help Natasha become more familiar and comfortable with snowy terrain and conditions before he returned (and especially before their trip together to Nepal). We took a snowshoe trip (including her friend Emily) to the south peak of Mount Lillian near Blewett Pass a couple of days before Christmas, during which there was 3’-5’ deep of powder snow that really slowed our progress all day. Then Natasha and I took a snowshoe trip to Tye Peak near Stevens Pass a few days before the New Year, during which I showed her some basic techniques for snowshoeing and ice axe. The trip provided excellent training for the outdoors, and would probably help Natasha gain further confidence on future trips. The Tye Peak trip had a good route, great weather, and fantastic views of terrain both near and far. Natasha Ascends Tye Peak... What A Great Year! Looking Forward To The Future! It was a perfect way to end a wonderful peakbagging year, my best peakbagging year to date.

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/thru-hike-of-the-pacific-crest-trail/344229,Thru-Hike of the Pacific Crest Trail,2006-09-25,"Why do you want to hike from Mexico to Canada? Starting at the Mexican Border How do you put a five-month hike into a trip report of a few pages? Most of my daily journal entries are about a page each. That is the main reason it has taken me so long to get around to writing this - it seemed like an overwhelming task. So I will mostly hit a few highlights and share some thoughts and feelings. Why would anyone want to spend five months walking from Mexico to Canada? Most thru-hikers get asked that question over and over. It's like asking a mountain climber, why do you climb mountains. For me it started when I was active in the singles group of my church in Manhattan Beach, a suburb of Los Angeles. Jason, one of the class members, started leading monthly hikes for the group, usually in the Angeles National Forest in the San Gabriel Mountains, just north of Los Angeles. I was already mountain biking, roller blading, and rock climbing; and enjoyed the mountains and the other group activities, so became a regular on the hikes as well. This was the start of my love of hiking. Jason also organized a few camping trips and backpacking trips, including to the Grand Canyon. I had been brought up camping but had never done any backpacking before. One trip and I was hooked on that too. On many of the hikes in the Angeles National Forest, we would see signs for, and hike on part of the Pacific Crest Trail. When I found out that it went from Mexico to Canada I thought that would be something fun to do someday. In the years that followed, I joined an adventure racing club and the outdoor activities progressed to longer, harder and more frequent. In the summer of 2002 I went to Peru on a two-week hiking mission trip. That turned into a three-year stint the following year. In 2005, knowing that my term would be up in January of 2006, I started making plans to thru-hike the PCT. The timing all came together, no job, no mortgage or other expenses, and some money in the bank from selling my house when I went to Peru. Southern California, the Deserts Mojave Desert Going Up Baden Powell I started my hike on April 28 at the Mexican border. I was trying to finish in four months and I had already purchased my return ticket to Peru based on that schedule. The first week went well, and then I started getting blisters. I was also hiker faster than most of the others so I was passing a lot of people but not spending much time with them, and wasn't making any friendships with other hikers. After two weeks I had to take a few days off to let the blisters heal. I also realized that I needed to slow down and spend time with other hikers if I wanted to make friendships, which was one of my goals for the hike. After leaving Big Bear, CA, I did slow down and started hiking with four other people. Two of them were section hiking and one had to stop due to injury, but I hiked with go-Big, the other one, most of the way to the Oregon border. The desert areas of Southern California were hard; I told myself then that I never wanted to hike them again. We had to constantly be aware of where our next water source would be, and many times carried three to four liters of water. And yet they had their own beauty, they didn't last forever, and they provided bonding experiences. They were also broken up with the snowy mountains and beautiful trees. The town stops were frequent and gave us time to relax with other hikers as well. Sierra Nevada - Lots of Snow, Fast Rivers! Mono Creek Crossing Ready to Help up Mather Pass Just after we started the High Sierra, we met Swiss Miss and Pang. I hiked together with them the rest of the way to Canada. Along the way, I spend varying amounts of time with other hikers as well. A group of 12 of us left Yosemite together - The Dirty Dozen! Half of us were from the U.S. and half were from other countries, so it became a very international experience. Each of us had strengths and weakness, and we learned to work together as a team, and to help and depend on each other. My greatest fear before starting the hike was crossing the rapid flowing, icy cold rivers. They turned out to not be as terrible as I had expected. We had a few close calls and some struggles, but the teamwork was amazing and we did it together. We entered the Sierra Nevada on June 11, in a very heavy snow year, so we spent about a month hiking through snow, sometimes only getting down below snow level in the evening to camp. I had very little experience hiking in deep snow, and no experience navigating when the trail was covered with snow most of the day. Mostly we did it with map and compass but we did use a GPS some to pinpoint the trail location, and to confirm which was the right pass a few times. I had crampons at the beginning of the Sierras but soon lost them off the back of my pack before I ever used them. One thing we didn't have to worry about was water. We got spoiled by only having to carry a liter or two of water. We often drank directly from springs and the snow melt streams, without bothering to treat the water. We carried ice axes but after the first couple of passes, they were used mostly for digging cat holes. The sun cups were one of the biggest problems, along with post holing in the soft snow in the afternoons. Almost everyone used trail running shoes, except the Europeans who wore mountaineering boots. We had wet feet the whole way through the Sierras from the snow and river crossings, and much of Washington from the rain and new snow, but surprisingly it wasn't much of a problem. We did get tired of the snow and needing to be constantly on the search for the trail. I would like to go back and hike the John Muir Trail (most of which is the same as the PCT) in the fall, when you can actually walk on the trail. Oregon and Washington - It's Finished U.S./Canadian Border Crater Lake You realize how long California is when you hike the whole way, it took three months and one week to reach Oregon, but I never got tired of the continually changing and always beautiful scenery. From Mt. Shasta on we had numerous forest fires, causing hazy skies, beautiful sunsets, and closed trails and detours. For the last month we weren't sure we would be able to finish the trail at Manning Park. We did have to skip a section in Oregon due to fires, but the final section before the Canadian border reopened just before we got there. Unlike some just ahead of us, we were able to finish at the official terminating point, and get our pictures at the border monument. That is the thru-hiker's ""summit"" moment, similar to when a mountaineer reaches the top of the mountain. Oregon was only three weeks and Washington took four weeks, and then it was all over, except for the very emotional goodbyes. Unlike the mountaineer, who still has to get down the mountain after the summit, the hike ended on an emotional high, with nowhere to go, no descend time to unwind. We spent a couple of days there, not wanting to say goodbye and go home. It's hard to describe the feeling of watching the mountain peak landmarks pass below on the flight back to L.A, five months going by in fast reverse in a couple of hours! And then came trying to go back to a ""normal"" life, when our main concerns for so long were just walking, eating and sleeping. Now we were home, at least our bodies were, but our minds keep wandering back to the trail. Saying Goodbye, Ready to Hike Again Saying Goodbye Ready to Hike Again Many people have commented on it as being ""The trip of a lifetime"". I understand what they mean but I have a problem with that. There is a common disease that affects many long distance thru-hikers. I have the disease and there is no cure. It is only alleviated to some degree by going on another long hike. When and where I don't know, but I’m sure it will happen. It's been 11 months since I finished the hike and I can still spend hours looking through some of the thousands of photos, or watching someone's slide show, and every time I do, I wish I could grab my backpack and head back to the trail. Just writing this and thinking about it causes me to get emotional and longing for the ""simple"" life on the trail. Of course like most difficult, but rewarding experiences, it's easy to forget the hard times and only remember the good. From the Mexican border to Manning Park, British Columbia, Canada, took 151 days. It was an experience I will never forget. God showed me His faithfulness and provision every step of the way. The friendships made on the hike are very special, the shared experiences of the joys, hardships and dangers of the trail made for deep and lasting bonds. I could not have completed the hike without the help of many of those I spent a lot of time hiking with. Others added a rich dimension to the experience and made it a delight, even through the difficult times. I give thanks to God first and then to each one that He provided to make the hike such a wonderful experience.

After the first month I figured the blisters were past, but then got them again later, I think it was in Oregon, when we tried doing too many miles a day, too fast. You are still young, do a thru-hike while it is ""easy"". Although a bunch of us older guys put in a good showing. We finished with a 65 year old man.

Some fellow PCT hikers just finished the CDT and I read their journals. Too much road walking and ""find your own route"" for me, hopefully it will be easier to hike before I get too old. I'm leaning towards a re-do of the PCT or maybe a southbound AT hike first (less crowded, less party scene).

multi-day,https://www.summitpost.org/astonishing-journey-through-the-glacier-peak-wilderness/810476,Astonishing Journey through the Glacier Peak Wilderness,2010-07-30,"Introduction ""The voyage of discovery is not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes "" -Marcel Proust This was the longest adventure of the year, but at the same time a very rewarding one. This is the sequel of the Glacier Peak Adventure. Gimpilator and Redwic had wanted to climb this peak for a while. They knew that I recently did the standard route and wanted someone to guide the way, so they hired me. I suppose one could say ""I am never finished"". Before the trip even started I had a lot to take care of the night before the climb. Finally when I tried to get rest my dog kept me up and before long Redwic arrived at my house. ""Oh boy"" I thought as I grabbed my gear because I knew I was in for a long day of endurance. Day 1: Pressing on to CampI bought some chocolate milk in Darrington (as always) and from here we got to the North Sauk River Trailhead. The hike started out relatively easy, and I was glad it was cool out. I was too concentrated with the climb to worry about photography until we got near White Pass. As we got towards White Pass my sleepiness started to catch up to me. Hiking the trail to White Pass Green Scenery near White Pass At the Pass we took a break, ate some donuts, and carried on hiking. After traversing the bottom of White Mountain, we missed the turn off for Glacier Peak because the lower fork in the trail looked more used. I told the group I did not remember traveling as far east as we were, but I guess we figured this was the summer trail. As we were walking along, Redwic says ""How far does this trail go?"" and ironically a few seconds later it ended. ""Now what?"" I was wondering as I looked up the slope. We decided to go up a small ridge to a highpoint. From here we traversed down the ridge and onto the original path. This must have added a few extra miles... oh well. Michael and I taking a Rest And I thought I was Sleepy Michael with White Mountain Mount Baker to the North Approaching Glacier Peak below White Mountain White Mountain Southeast Face Indian Head Peak Michael resting with Glacier Peak Hiking down the Ridge I took a break to get some water and food while everyone else went ahead. It took me an awful deal of time to get everything repacked and head out, by the time I started running, they were out of view. I did not want to be left behind so I charged up the hill, which ended up tiring me out. Fortunately they were not as far as I had worried, they stopped for me on a rock out cropping. As I layed down, I was told to find some shade to protect my face from the sun. I was very tired by this point, and laying on the ground was not comfortable. When I tried to reach my water bottle I noticed how hard something as simple as that became. I suppose the fact that I been up 28 hours had an effect on that. Once I got up, the dizziness faded off, and I felt well enough to head to Glacier Gap. So tired, must rest now White Chuck Glacier View White Chuck Glacier Remnant The going was tiring, I was getting more and more drained as we headed up. ""C'mon, you can do it, you must do it, no giving up this early"" I kept chanting in my head as we were heading towards Glacier Gap. I'm amazed I was able to endure it, not just mentally, but earlier I had feared that if I stopped, I could easily fall asleep in an instant. Before heading out for the trip I had wanted a challenge, but I soon realized this was a little much for me, next time I think I'll get a better nights rest. Long Way To Go Once we got to Glacier Gap we set up Camp, and I was finally able to rest. In the distance we saw a small cloud which at first I did not think much of it, but it kept getting bigger and bigger. Once it got quite big and dark, we all wondered if there was a forest fire near the city of Holden or around Lake Chelan. Michael cooked me some top romen which was very nice. This was by far the hardest day of the trip, as I went to bed, I hoped that tomorrow would not be worse. I slept right away until wake up time. Looking East from our Camp Spot An Explosion looking Cloud over Bonanza Peak Showy Jacob's Ladder Camping at Glacier Gap During the night in a sense one could say I am still climbing, I had a dream I was climbing a mountain and we got caught in a terrible storm. When we got down, we were in the city late at night and were wondering ""how are we going to get home?"" A nice bus driver said ""I'll take you home"" which we trusted. She ended up being a crazy driver. Fortunately it was only a dream which was similar to my Rainier trip on the bus ride when we swerved and I almost fell out of the bus. Day 2: Summiting Glacier PeakAt 1:49 a.m. I woke up to mice trying to get our stuff. ""They're still after our food at this altitude?"". Michael and I had to chase them away, but they were very persistent and would only come back 10 seconds later. I checked the time on my camera watch which was 1:59 a.m. ""Awww man!"" I said aloud, because I had wanted some more sleep, but I knew in less than a minute the rest of the party would wake up for the climb up Glacier Peak. We stashed our stuff in the snow, got our stuff ready, and began heading towards Glacier Peak. Night over Kololo Peak Once we got over the small pass, we started dealing with hard snow, which got a little steep. Everyone except for me started putting on there crampons, but I knew there was not enough time for me to do so, so I used the time to put on gaitors. The group seemed concerned that I did not put mine on. Michael and I headed down a slope which led to some rocks, after this we rejoined with Redwic and Gimpilator. Once we got on the ridge, we were finally on Glacier Peak. The starting out was tougher on me then most of the group, I was always pushing myself to keep up with everyone. As we were climbing up I could see a big cloud to the south, and to my amazement I could see red lightning bolts. Eventually we all had to put on crampons, and shortly after roped up. Michael and I climbing in the Early Hours Morning Light on Glacier Peak Heading towards Disappointment Peak As usual I was the guy in the front, things got easier from here. I figured the team still wanted to go fast, so when I went fast everyone told me to slow down which was a relief. After crossing the bottom of the Dissapointment, we got to the Cool Glacier which is when the crevasses started coming on. I had to carefully traverse a few, but after this it was much easier. Although I did not travel on a boot path by this point, I saw one in the distance which I got onto. There was one other crevasse which involved some careful crossing, but beyond this there was little crevasse danger. Once we got to the ridge we unroped. Traveling on the Gerdine Glacier Tenpeak Mountain The Summit Of Glacier From here we scrambled up the final approach gulley to the summit. There was no ice coming down this time. I was very happy when we got to the top, even though I had already been there. The time was 8:15 a.m. Gimpilator had red vines and some other food to share. Blue Haze over the Mountains Jack Mountain and Buckner Mount Shuksan in the Distance Eldorado to the North Yours Truly on the Summit Kololo Peak Below Looking East Hiking on the Summit Above Disappointment Peak Michael on the Summit Hiking up the Ridge Rule #62: Don't Take Yourself So Seriously Red Vine Party Having Fun on the Summit We noticed the temperature rapidly getting warmer, so after 15-20 minutes on the summit we started heading down. When we got back to the lower portion of the ridge we reroped up. As we headed down towards one of the crevasses, I was surprised at how much softer the snow had gotten. At the snow bridge I tested to see how solid it was, my ice axe went straight though. I could see it was also over hanging. I told Michael ""watch me!"". I carefully traversed to the right until I found a good enough spot to cross, my ice axe still plunged through, but now I could at least some what safely jump it. Heading Down Glacier Peak After I was done, Michael crossed it, Redwic decided we should go even further over so that he has a safe crossing. When he jumped, his foot partly sank in, but he had enough speed so that he was fine, then Gimpilator crossed it, now we were all past it. From here there was only one more crevasse crossing. On the last one I realized it was not going to last long, Michael predicted it would only last a day or so. From here the danger was out of the way. We then headed for the ridge. Roping up near the Disappointment Peak A Crevasse Cave Hiking along the Cool Glacier At the ridge we unroped, and headed down. I got a pretty good glissade, but soon realized I was on a Glacier and headed back to the ridge. From here we went back over the pass and to our camp. I went to sleep quite fast. An hour later I was woken up because we had to go. ""I was in my nice warm bed sleeping, and now I have to wake up to the miserable reality"" I mumbled to myself as I was getting up. I felt soar all over, and was quite tired. Fortunately some water helped fix that. Now we had to head over to White Pass. Traveling was not as bad as I had expected it to be, we reached the bottom of the Plug in decent timing. Ten Peaks to the East White Chuck Marmot From here Redwic and the rest of us got in a debate on which way to go to White Pass. We ended up going the Standard way. After a while we started to head up the pass. I wondered how bad the next two days were going to be, not only was I tired, but Michael and I were low on food. As we got towards White Pass we separated a little, Michael and I were in the front while Redwic and Gimpilator were in the back. While Gimpilator and Redwic took a stop, they saw an amazing marmot fight which I thought was one of the most interesting things I have ever heard of while in the mountains. From here we got to White Pass, searched for a camp ground and set up camp. The mosquitoes were back. As I was unpacking our things, Joanna was walking towards our camp site. Redwic told Gimpilator and Gimpilator said ""I'm not falling for that one"" which it really was her. I had told her I was going here, but was not sure if she actually was coming. I took a few photos of the sunset and went to bed. Sunset on White Pass Sunset over White Mountain Day 3: White Mountain, Portal Peak, and OutThe next morning there was clouds all around, it was quite misty, and I was very tired. Michael told me my boots were wet as well. Now I was unsure if I wanted to climb White Mountain or not, if there were no views, I would for sure get blisters, and it would be tough, would it be worth it? I almost gave up and went to sleep. But in the back of my mind a voice rang to me ""Where is your sense of Adventure? This is not like you, your going to go out and do this!"". Of course I gave in, and put sense to the side and got up. Our Camp near White Pass White Mountain with Morning Mist Sloan Peak to the West I had to filter some water before heading out, Michael made some tasty hot chocolate for us. We then went to White Pass to climb White Mountain. At the top the views were quite good. Not long after we summited we traversed over to Portal Peak.

Once at Red Pass it was a little bit of a scramble over some rocks, and from there we were near the summit. On the summit Joanna gave us some chips which we had a mini party. Redwic said ""oh too bad, the peak is only 6,999 feet, just short of 7,000 feet"". ""I'll change that!"" I exclaimed to Redwic, and he did not believe I could change it. I found a slanted rock, stashed it on, found more rocks, and after a while got it well over a foot taller. After this we went down to White Pass.

We packed up camp, and went down towards the car. I met HulkSmash as we were heading down. We took a break at the shelter below. Then we met Opus, and were soon at the trailhead. It was a amazing trip, and it was neat to see more nwhikers. Another great trip in the mountains.

My posting of this trip report was completely unrelated to the page put it.
