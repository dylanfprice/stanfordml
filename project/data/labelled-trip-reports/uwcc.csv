"mount-challenger","A near epic at Challenger","Earlier this summer Noel Vaughn, Gary Yngve, Arni Magnusson and I set out to climb Mount Challenger in the North Pickets, and traverse through North Cascades National Park from west to east while we were at it. This turned out to be quite a trip - read on for the full story. \
\
I started planning the Challenger trip months in advance, after hearing about the awesome experience another friend had in August 2001. They had two groups of 6-7 each, one group that traversed from Hannegan Pass by Easy Ridge to the Challenger Glacier and then out by Wiley Ridge and down the Big Beaver River valley, and another group that reversed this itinerary. It took five days, everybody met close to the summit and at the trailheads after the trips they simply got into each others cars, drove back to Seattle and threw a big party. Fittingly enough they called the trip the \""Challenger Simul-Traverse\""...\
\
I wanted to duplicate their trip fairly closely, and initially quite a few people expressed interest but as it drew nearer to August 7, our departure date, it became clear that we only had enough people for one direction. Then two more people bailed and we were suddenly left with four climbers and one car, complete with a permit to camp one night on Easy Ridge, then three nights on the Challenger Glacier which meant we would have to pound Wiley Ridge and the Big Beaver trail in one, long haul. Heh, we promptly decided we'd throw a full-on 60m 10.5 mm climbing rope and a rock rack into the already heavy packs, and spend one day climbing Crooked Thumb after summiting Challenger.\
\
I remember thinking something like, oh well, nothing the trip throws at us will be worse than all the catherding I went through to get things going. \
\
Boy was I wrong.\
\
We drove to the Hannegan Pass trailhead on Tuesday August the 6th. The morning after we set out around 9 am and made the pass in a couple of hours. It was clear from the beginning that Noel and I preferred a somewhat faster pace than Arni and Gary but that was alright - we were all keen on keeping the group together. \
\
From Hannegan Pass we dropped down into the Chilliwack River Valley and hiked on to the US Cabin campground. A little further down is a cable car crossing of the Chilliwack and I had been told that the climbers' trail leading up to Easy Ridge was \""across from the campground\"" - this came from a ranger, who also told me that we should cross the river using the cable car. \
\

\
We followed these directions faithfully, and bushwhacked for five hours that afternoon looking for the non-existent trail. It was getting dark when we gave up, crossed the river again and set up camp at US Cabin. \
\
The morning after we crossed the river right there, on a big log. We started bushwhacking again looking for the trail, but still couldn't find it. It wasn't until later that we found out that there is another campground, across the Chilliwack from Easy Creek, where climbers normally stop before going on to Easy Ridge. The much-looked-for trail is across from [b:139kkhtz]that[/b:139kkhtz] campground, not US Cabin Camp. So we never found it where we were looking. Instead we bushwhacked for eight hours, through alder, devil's club, huckleberry bushes and regular old trees, past cliffs and whatnot, to finally gain the crest of the ridge in the mid-afternoon. To add insult to injury we finally found the much-wanted trail less than 15 minutes from the crest. Here's a Where's Waldo-type illustration of our trip so far - can you find the hidden climber?\

\
Easy Ridge is an amazing place. It's really big and flat, there is enough space for a whole parade up there, but the northern side is sheer and drops down to permanent snowfields below. We made short work of the hike along the ridge and put up the Climbing Club's three person tent a little after dark, in a good spot overlooking Whatcom Peak and Perfect Pass. By now we had spent 13 hours bushwhacking where none was really needed, all because of bad beta - and my naivete. Lesson #1 - only listen to the climbing rangers when planning climbing trips. The other rangers should be sent to bushwhacking school en masse. We were pretty beat, especially Arni and Noel.\
\
Phew... I'll finish this later!"
,"Colchuck Balanced Rock- West Face","I've been eying this line for years and when I finally found some one dumb enou....I mean crazy enough to follow my ass up this route I jumped at the opportunity. Boy were we in for a treat.
In our infinite wisdom, we attempted to do the whole thing in a day from Seattle, rather then crash in the Colchuck Lake parking lot and get a early start from their. We would pay later for our lack of foresight as will be shown. We arrived at the Colchuck Lake trailhead around 730am packed up our &quot;light and fast&quot; packs and headed towards the climb. We made good time and made it to the basin below Balanced Rock around 12pm. We got our bearings on the route and started climbing

[img:2qi5lb67]http&#58;//www&#46;cascadeclimbers&#46;com/plab/data/500/CBR_11&#46;jpg[/img:2qi5lb67]

Pitch 1 is rated 10b but it is really just a one move wonder to a huge jug. It is also about as short as a guys member after getting out of a cold pool. Pitch 2 involved a 5.7 chimney followed by a sweet (Pitch 3) 5.9 corner crack:

[img:2qi5lb67]http&#58;//www&#46;cascadeclimbers&#46;com/plab/data/500/medium/CBR_17&#46;jpg[/img:2qi5lb67]

Some root pulling and tree climbing (Pitch 4) got to the base of the money pitch. I am not sure if I can describe in words how unbelievable the 5.11 crack on pitch 5 is. The crack is a thing of beauty with unbelievably solid hand jams straight up.

  [img:2qi5lb67]http&#58;//www&#46;cascadeclimbers&#46;com/plab/data/504/medium/5851_1179285450287_1472696440_30475158_3373087_n&#46;jpg[/img:2qi5lb67]

Hanging once, I need to get back out there to do it clean, I finish underneath the huge gaping maw that is the start of Pitch 6. If Pitch 5 is the spiritual uplifting pitch then pitch 6 is the back to earth, dude we are really fricking high, and underneath a really big f***ing roof pitch. I tried working the awkward moves on it but seeing as slab climbing while grabing sloppy holds and placing gear at the same time didn't really appeal to me(Read: I am a wuss) I did the next best thing and aided the bastard.

[img:2qi5lb67]http&#58;//www&#46;cascadeclimbers&#46;com/plab/data/500/CBR_26&#46;jpg[/img:2qi5lb67]

Pitch 7 climbs a fun but a little awkward 5.9 crack to 5.12/C-1 roof. Don't underestimate the chimney on Pitch 8. I laughed my ass off watching my partner clutch and claw up up this thing until it was my turn and found myself whining like a little baby as well. Now here was the fun part for us. Seeing as we got such a late start we didn't top until dark. Which made route finding to the summit problematic. We prevailed and it was at this point that we got Nelsoned. Nelsons guide book neglects to say anything about rapping anything. Not a huge issue if you can see but not expecting a repel we were a little dumb founded until we noticed the slung chicken heads. Also Nelson's guide says descend sandy ledges south. Where south? Directly south towards Coluchuck Lake and off a cliff, south and left towards Asgards Pass, or south and right towards the base of the route, where south? (Just a note: I realize that none of this would have been a problem if we had given ourselves more time to do the route, in the light, rather take our sweet ass time and finish it in the dark but hey whats a TR without a random rant about Nelsons guide books.) Needless to say we paid for our lack of vision, literally and figuratively, and spent most of the night meandering around until we found the way down oh around 6am. From that point it was grab our shit and make b-line for the Sleepy Lady and their amazing bacon breakfast burritos.
In closing, this route is probably up there with one of the best routes I've ever done. Beautiful scenery and amazing climbing will be had if you choose to do this route which you should.

PS: All photo creds go to my partner Dan E. Sorry I took such crappy pictures, I'll try and do better next time Dan. And I know my grammar is bad so deal!!!


Gear Notes:
Double sets through #3, 1 #4 and a set of micro's if you plan on aiding the 5.12 roof.



Approach Notes:
Easy. My only suggestion is bring an I-Pod for the hike in because the approach trail to Colchuck Lake kind of blows (It is actually very beautiful hike but this is my third time hiking in on this trail and I needed something to take the edge off)"
,"Spray Park","Hey all,\
My network went down, so I have to waste some time.  \
Collin and I set off for my mellow mid-week trip to spray park to get some cool pictures of the wildflowers and possibly ski the flett glacier.  One problem, a mellow trip can't happen when you leave the car with a rope, ice rack, and ice tools.  Running shoes, posh trails, beautiful meadows lead us to the north face of observation rock.  We decided to go for it.  Some steepish snow/alpine ice/front-pointing in telemark boots/our lack of desire to get out a rope forced us to exit the n.f. about half pitch from the top onto this \""rock band\"".  I don't know if it is just me or the cascades in general, but I am a magnet for being on the nuus.  I hate that red/flakey/crumbly crap.  An hour of sketchy downclimbing got us back onto the glacier.  A cloud covered Rainier so the snow didn't soften up as I would have liked.  But I put on the skiis anyway because I carried the things this far.  Some good turns then survival skiing on hard suncups brought us back into the running shoes.  Some cool pics of wildflowers and on home.  All and all, a \""MELLOW\"" day in the cascades.\

"ruth-mountain","Ruth Mtn TR","Five of (Stebbi, Lilja,Throstur, Ania, and I) us set out for the Ruth Glacier\
on Saturday. The weather looked pretty iffy as we drove up I5 and we even\
debated going to Silver Star instead, but pushed on to Ruth anyway. The\
valley was pretty socked in with clouds and we only really got drizzled\
while we hiked in.  When we stopped on the ridge to set up a camp, it\
started to get a lot colder and more rainy. After fumbling to set up a\
tarp to keep the gear more or less covered and set up tents, we picked\
lots of blueberries (!!), ate dinner and took little walks around the area\
to stay warm. We could see down the valleys on either side of the\
ridge, but we didn't have a clear view of Hannegan Mtn, Shusksan, Ruth\
or anything... At some point it stopped raining, and started to clear up,\
we got a nice sunset view at the west end of the valley and the two guys\
had hiked along the ridge further to scout out the route for the\
morning... We crashed around 9, mainly because it was cold and we didnt\
have anything else to do. Stebbi had planned to sleep in a bivy and down\
jacket--this plan lasted maybe 4 hrs when he was too cold and\
uncomfortable, he squeezed into one of the tends and slept on and off till\
morning. We were up and moving sometime after 8 (no early alpine start!),\
debated still if we felt up to the summit, as things were still pretty\
socked in, but decided to go for it. We made the summit in a few hours.\
While we played around and took some pictures (mainly of each other, since\
there was no summit view to speak of--we only could see the bottom 3rd of\
Shuskan...), light snowflakes started to fall. As we descended, the clouds\
filled in behind us.\
\
I'm glad we went on the trip. We had a good time, enjoyed each others'\
company, Ania and I learned a *teeny weeny* bit of Islandic, Lilja\
persisted great in spite of blistered heels, Thorstur experienced his\
first ever backpacking and climbing trip, and Stebbi woke up realizing he\
wanted to buy a new tent! I'd happily go there again and see all the views\
so many of you told me to expect. Plus, it looks like a really good ski."
,"The Enchantments","My parents and I went on a trip to the Enchantments Tues-Thurs.  We were at the ranger station bright and early at 7:45 for the \""lottery.\""  There were 8 slots available for the Enchantments region and 12 people wanting them.  Somehow all 12 got permits fot there. <!-- s:) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\"" alt=\"":)\"" title=\""Smile\"" /><!-- s:) -->\
\
Soon we were on the trail, overnight packs and all.  My parents were real troopers, hauling up from Snow Lake TH (1100 ft) to our campsite by Lake Vivianne (6800 ft) in a day.  The weather was not too hot, and there were streams everywhere -- the water filter is so worth its weight in gold.  By evening, we were lounging around camp, watching the last rays of sun leave Prusik Peak.  No wind, no bugs, clear blue skies.  Also hardly any people -- most people were taking two days to reach the Enchantments from Snow Lake TH, and the predicted bad weather Sat-Mon likely scared away others.  \
\
My parents got a gift from a friend which was money to be spent on camping food.  We went to REI and bought six Mountain House meals: chicken teriyaki, three-cheese lasagna, three-bean chili, homestyle turkey and potatoes, beef stroganoff, and caribbean rice and beans.  Overall, the food was quite tasty, though the meat portions were scarce (we made up for this by eating eggs and horsecock for breakfast).  I finally succeeded in emptying my fuel canister from Challenger... it just kept on going and going...\
\
Wednesday was a nice day as well.  We wandered around the Enchantments to Asgaard Pass, taking many pictures along the way.  Streams everywhere; no need to carry water.  No golden larches quite yet though.  We saw a few people, but not too many.  Most had come up Asgaard Pass.  There was a cool elderly couple who had climbed Whatcom Peak years ago.  We scrambled up the Enchantment Ridge and headed to its westernmost point, giving grand views of Dragontail, Colchuck, and Stuart.  The skies had very little haze in them, and we could make out Glacier Peak and even Mount Baker.  Towards the end of the day, we stopped by Snow Creek Glacier (between Dragontail and Witch's Tower), and I gave my dad his first experience with axe and crampons.  The snow was very hard, but soon he was jogging traverses on 25-degree slopes.  We got back to camp an hour before dark and started to prepare dinner.  All of a sudden, we saw two mountain goats to the left of camp, two to the right, and one in front... They had us outflanked!  We were ready to surrender and start urinating, but it turns out they were just passing through so they could drink at the lake.  \
\
Thursday we slept in, ate a casual breakfast, and then descended.  The descent wasn't terribly noteworthy, except that unlike the previous days, it was really really hot.  But the filter made everything happy. <!-- s:) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\"" alt=\"":)\"" title=\""Smile\"" /><!-- s:) -->  We got back to the car in mid-afternoon and drove home.  We saw a lot more people on the trail compared to the previous days, and the bugs were starting to appear again."
"vesper-peak","TR: Vesper Peak (N Face)","Colin and I climbed Vesper Peak this past Wednesday by the North Face (described in Nelson's Vol. II).  We left Seattle a little past 4am and were off on the trail just as the sky was starting to lighten.  Carrying light packs, we cruised up the trail and located Headlee Pass, which was easy since both of us had been up to Vesper before.  I had gotten off-trail and wandered up the wrong gully last time I was there, and this was Colin's fourth attempt on the North Face, so there was no way we'd get lost this time.\
\
After a snack just after the scree crossing, we followed the trail further and then turned right to drop down on snow and slabs to the notch above the lake.  A short scramble took us down onto a rocky finger poking at the melted glacier.  There were some big cracks, but easily navigable.  We had been worried about the moat crossing and spent a bit of time trying to pick out the best line up the steeper lower wall.  We saw a couple possible snow bridges and picked one that led to a clean-looking slabby gully system on the right side of the large \""depression\"" that Nelson mentions.  We ended up having to traverse a bit under the big upper slab several pitches later, but our route seemed to be the best option at the time.\
\
Still in the shade, the glacier was firm and lovely under our crampons.  We crossed the moat, racked up, and I led the first pitch on good rock through a 15' section of hand jams to a slightly sketchy traverse on slabs and a decent ledge belay.  I had to downclimb a bit mid-pitch after a promising finger-size undercling under a roof turned out to be a bottomed-out dirty groove.\
\
Colin took the next lead and the protection got more sparse.  He took a long time to find and set up a belay, as I would on the next pitch, a weird scramble up bulges and dirty cracks with little pro (I dislodged two of my nut placements with my feet and rope drag).  Once I ran out of rope, I agonized over finding an anchor.  I managed to get a #2 tricam to stay put long enough to equalize it with a pair of nuts wedged against each other.  A medium nut in a flared, shallow constriction completed the system, and I braced myself against the surrounding bulges to bring Colin up.  By now, we were both a little freaked out about the lack of pro, although the climbing was easy.\
\
The next couple hundred feet of scrambling led under the base of the slab and up through some steep heather-and-rock conglomerate.  Colin then took off for a short slab pitch to a ledge, where we managed to get in a couple small nuts, wanting to save the yellow Alien Colin had initially anchored with for the next slab pitch.  I led up and somehow found three or four gear placements in the slab's shallow horizontal grooves.  My new Mountain Masters were performing admirably on the friction moves and I was feeling much better about the climbing.   \
\
We moved the belay up the ledge to the base of the long right-facing corner leading to the top.  Colin's next lead was on plenty of good gear in the corner, and he set a belay to bring me up for the last 30m pitch (two pieces of pro).  We aired our feet in the sun and ate copious horsecock and crackers.\
\
The descent was quite nice, on slabs all the way down to the trail.  It had taken us a while to climb each pitch, mostly because we fretted with gear and with setting up belays, so it was getting on into the afternoon.  We had only 4 miles or so to hike out, but we hurried down, only stopping at Headlee Pass for water and blister prevention and at the river crossing to put on headlamps.  We reached the car at sunset, truly a full day behind us.\

Contemplative TR and a few photos also available on my website: [url:e4cu00qh]http&#58;//bodenner&#46;net/~rkb/climb/vesper-sep-11-2002&#46;php[/url:e4cu00qh]"
,"TR: Ingalls Peak","Daniel is a buddy of mine from the Mountaineers and also a grad student in physics at UW (yep, I told him to join UWCC).  Both of us lack cars, so we haven't done anything together all summer.  This weekend we rented a car and left for the mountains.\
\
Friday night we drove to Ingalls TH.  We parked next to another car but at a little angle so we could sleep in the parking lot in the gap between.  To our surprise, the car left around midnight, and every time we heard a car in the parking lot, we woke up, wondering if they were going to run us over.  It was pretty chilly, and we slept in late, not hitting the trail until 7:15, leaving the TH at the same time as six Mountaineers.  We made good time to Ingalls Pass and proceeded, in fine UWCC tradition, to get lost, taking a trail that went down to the valley.  We corrected ourselves and were soon at Ingalls Lake.  Streams near the lake were covered in thin sheets of ice.  It must have been even colder up there.  We then headed up, and again, in fine UWCC tradition, got lost... we scrambled up a 3rd class gully that turned into loose 4th class stuff, topping out on a ledge somewhere on the East Peak\
(we got the North-East notch confused with the South-North notch).  We found a horn, rapped down, and got ourselves to the start of the route of the South Ridge -- still ahead of the six Mountaineers, but behind a group of three.  \
\
The South Ridge was quite fun.  Daniel and I climbed it with boots and pack, and we each had all sorts of unnecessary crap in our packs (I thought I left that bottle of fuel at the car!).  Two pitches on really bizarre rock but well-protected.  You have to see and feel the rock to appreciate it.  Ranges from super-frictiony to super-slick.  Beckey's right -- you don't need cams for the route, but I still lugged four with me.  The climbing was uneventful, except for when I put Daniel on belay at the top.  Somehow I managed to scrape my elbow against the rock while screwing with my pack with my nonbrake hand.  Normally no big deal, but I had a scab there from last week, and the rock ripped it right off.  So by the time Daniel came up, the slab just below me was covered in red polka-dots (I was trying to steer the drops of blood away from any clothes/gear).  \
\
We spent quite a bit of time on the summit -- great views of four volcanoes, among other cool mountains.  We hooked up with the group of three in front of us for the rappel down.  They had a 50 m rope and a 60 m rope, but apparently a 50 m rappel teeters out just short of the ledge.  The other two of that group weren't eager to downclimb, so we offered our rope in exchange for a ride down (that way we didn't have to descend the SW face and get lost again).  I was last on that rope, and they had tied a double fisherman, so I slid the knot over the lip and beyond a crack.  I began to rappel, and stupid me, five feet down, I hit the knot.  I whipped out prusiks, passed the knot, and got going again.  Down at the bottom, we saw a guy screw up.  He was belaying his follower and was careless on the rope management, letting the pulled-in rope slide down the slab, down as far as thirty feet.  Naturally, the rope found a horn to get stuck on.  Luckily there was a party climbing just below who freed their rope.  Sometime around then, a blue pocketknife with the corkscrew open came bouncing down from the top.  Back at the parking lot we bumped into a UW EE grad student (Shree, I think) who was planning on doing WR Sherpa the next day.  Told him about UWCC too. \
After a bit of a drive, we were in Leavenworth for beer and dinner at Gustav's.  We found a pullout off the road somewhere and slept behind the car.  \
\
The next morning we headed to Castle Rock.  We were planning on doing Saber and Midway.  We found the large corner that was Saber but weren't sure how to start it.  I first started on the buttress to the right and traversed a ledge to within spitting distance of Saber.  Here all it was just a single committing step to enter the wide crack/chimney and continue up. But the handholds weren't great and there was no pro to guard the traverse (I think there might have been handholds or pro had I been taller).  I didn't place any pieces on the way up because I didn't want hellish ropedrag, and the ground seemed around 25 feet below me... and I ended up wimping out and downclimbing.\
\
I then tried to go up the wide crack/chimney from the very bottom.  The first move required gaining a small overhang.  The crux turned out to be a weirdish stem/mantle/fist jam.  I wasn't quite flexible to bring my foot up to where I needed it, so I used my free hand pull my leg up.  Soon I was on the other side of that airy step, ready to continue.  Going the crack from the bottom seems like the more aesthetic line, but it's also a lot harder than 5.4... but it's well-protected.  Heeding Ralph's warnings, I made sure I found the ledge and the bomber bolts.  Daniel followed up, taking the buttress on the right up yet cleaning my gear at the same time (he cleaned the nut from the ground, and he pulled the slip-knot on the horn off from above).  And he teased me that the step across wasn't so bad at all.  The second pitch was straight-forward, and we were soon on top.  We took a couple pics, and when we wanted to take a group pic, we set the timer and anchored the camera to the boulder with a blue alien that fit perfectly into a small slot.  \
\
We then descended and decided it was too hot and too crowded to try any more routes and went to get ice cream.  At the parking lot now was an old guy selling apples out of his pickup truck.  The pricing: one apple free, one big box of apples, six dollars.  After that one apple, we had to get some more (don't crack dealers also use this strategy?).  We split a box and headed for the DQ in Leavenworth.  Daniel, being a German citizen, found the town quite humorous.  In Bavaria, the McDonalds there just look like plain McDonalds.  We had a smooth drive back to Seattle.  US2 is much more pleasant in the daytime than at night.  We tuned into NPR and he found out the results of the German elections.  The people he wanted got elected -- a perfect end to a fun weekend.\
\
Damn, I didn't realize I wrote this much!"
"leavenworth-area-climbs","Cragging at Leavenworthless","Dan Perrakis and I played on Castle Rock Saturday. We did the Fault, Catapult (1st pitch) and the Bone on the lower rock, then Canary on the upper. Fun stuff. A regular set of cams from finger to #3 Costalot and a set of wires does the trick. The Bone and the upper (step-across) pitch of Canary are a full rope-length each so don't lighten the rack too much. Include a fingernail-sized microstopper to protect the somewhat bouldery beginning of the 1st pitch of Canary. It won't protect you from grounding but it will protect you from trundling down the hill if you set it right.\
\
We camped at Eight Mile with Dwayner and mtnrngr after running into those guys at Gustav's (@#$% $10 burgers but hey, the beer's alright). Dwayner gave us a cool topo hand-drawn on a napkin that would have been useful the day after except we lost it 5 minutes later. Apparently he guided at Leavenworth for a couple of decades, he knows those climbs down to the last crystal. Then bolts were discussed while mtnrngr and I grew glassy-eyed. I think the mutual agreement was that they completely disagreed that sport climbing is neither but then again I was spacing out at the end of all of that.\
\
The morning after Dan had to pee so we climbed Snow Creek Wall. Luckily he had beer at Gustav's the night before so his bladder chased him out of the sleeping bag early enough to get first in line for Outer Space. Stroke of luck #2 was that the 3rd party on the wall was slow moving and receiving moral support from the 2nd party which therefore didn't move that fast either, so we had no stress. There were [b:1y8wtkrr]a lot[/b:1y8wtkrr] of people that showed up but I think all the other parties turned around.  \
\
That climb is superb, the 4-5 cruxes are 10' or less and go at 5.8 and 5.9, but it's a long 6 pitches with a whole lot of incredibly exposed 5.6-5.7 - did I give that enough emphasis? I meant [b:1y8wtkrr]incredibly[/b:1y8wtkrr] exposed. Yell-for-mommy exposed. It was too long and burly for me, I am psyched to be getting back into this stuff after having scared myself out of it in May but didn't have either the head or the muscle for leading any of the interesting pitches. Dan ropegunned, I was impressed. The climbing we did Saturday is a whole lot harder psychologically than what we did Saturday. \
\
Some quantitative tidbits for all you schemers - we were at the base of the wall at 7:30 am and took 8 hours to finish. That was quite leisurely and we mostly weren't trading leads. We hiked up there at a grueling pace and still took 1:15 to get there, not the hour the guidebooks put it at. We had a bigger rack - 12 cams, probably two sets of stoppers, three hand-size hexes and four tricams on the smaller end. The crack pitches on the Shield leave you with literally an arms-length left of your 50 meter rope - you better hope you remember not to use too much of the rope for the anchor. Same thing with pro, we thought we had a lot but it all came in handy. There are no bolts at any of the belays or anywhere else on the route."
"chair-peak","TR:  Chair Peak Northeast Buttress","Trip Report for climb of Chair Peak via Northeast Buttress\
\
Short version:  we got schooled on the descent\
\
Long version:\
\
After reading several trip reports on the Internet, Elain and I decided that we wanted to climb Chair Peak via the Northeast Buttress.  From Smoot's guidebook, it sounded like it would be a fairly straightforward, short alpine scramble.  Elain was looking for something more sporty than a hike, and Chair Peak sounded like just the ticket.\
\
We got a late start, due to our somewhat nonchalant attitude about the climb, and finally hit the trail at 8:15 AM on Saturday Sep. 28.  Smoot's book recommends that you approach via the trail going up to the Snow Lake Divide, veering off onto a climber's trail just before the Divide.  Following the climber's trail along the ridge was easy, and after 15 minutes or so, we found ourselves descending the trail into a basin.  In the basin, we encountered a hiker who was also headed up to the Chair Peak area, apparently to retrieve some ski equipment that he had buried there (??).  He led us up and leftward across a talus field, then through some trees, and then across another talus field, until we reached the Thumb Tack rock.   I remember thinking to myself, \""this should be easy to retrace our steps, provided it is still light out\"".  We reached Thumb Tack rock at about 10:30 AM.  From there, Smoot describes two different approaches to the Northeast Buttress, one going directly right and up a gully, and the other going up the talus/snow field and then anging right up a different gully.  We took the first route, as it was reputed to be easier.   After some back-tracking, we found a reasonable line up the gully and eventually reached a pass along a ridgeline.  Dropping to the other side of the pass, we angled up and left along the ridgeline, reaching what we took to be the base of the Northeast Buttress at 11:30.  \
\
At this point, we donned harnesses and helmets and got out the rope, and were ready to roll at noon.  On the Northeast Buttress, Smoot describes two different routes, of which we chose the route that passes through a gully on the right.  The first pitch followed a steep gully that goes straight up, and then angles to the right.  After an aborted attempt to climb up the left side of the gully, I found a line that would work on the right side of the gully.  The second pitch climbed more of the gully, eventually reaching a clump of trees.  Owing to our lack of experience, our progress was slow but steady.  From the ledge in the trees, we chose to simul-climb a ways up a face on the Northeast Buttress, angling slowly left towards the East Face.  In hindsight I'm not sure if this was a good idea.  As I made my way over towards the East Face, I soon found the face of the buttress getting steeper and more exposed, and after a hundred feet or so of the simul-climbing, I decided to set up a belay on a small ledge.  The next pitch was the hardest, as my progress kept getting stymied by blank sections of steep rock.  It was hard to find a place to put in protection, so eventually I just banged in a pin using a rock.  The pin caused a large plate-sized flake to dislodge and tumble down the face (OOPS), so I had to search for a new spot to bash in a pin.  The rock quality seemed to be fairly poor in certain sections, so I had to be very careful not to dislodge large pieces of rock when zigzagging above Elain's belay stance.  \
\
The next pitch was fairly mellow by comparison, and I was on the false summit by about 5:00 PM.  Elain sooned joined me, and we started to think about options for descent.  After some discussion, we decided that we should try to find a gully that would take us down the east side of the mountain, as quickly as possible, owing to the lateness of the hour.  So we rappelled down a southweset-facing gully that terminates in the saddle between the false and true summits.  Within two raps and some downclimbing, we came to a saddle, with the left gully going down the east side, and the right gully facing west.  We could only see about 50 feet down the east-gully, but we could see rap slings, so we decided to give it a try.  We also saw many rap slings that were too high to reach on the walls of the gully, which we assume must have been set up during the winter season. The third rap (first rap down the east gully) went OK, and we came to another set of rap slings.  During the fourth rap (2nd down the east gully), it got dark.  I couldn't believe how fast the time had gone.  I was happy to have my headlamp, even if was an anemic Petzl Tikka.  The fourth rap was periodically overhanging, and due to the lateness of the hour, I could not determine whether the ends of the rope reached a suitable ledge.  Crossing my fingers, I rappelled down into the dark, and to my relief, reached the top of a sloping ledge just as the end of the rope ran through my belay device.  From there, I sought partial refuge under a boulder as Elain started her rappel.  As she rapped, there was a bombardment of rock, channeled down the steep gully.  I felt a heavy thud on my pack as a large rock hit it. \
\
Below us, the angle of the gully moderated a bit, with only occasional steep steps.  The fifth and sixth rappels were on sturdy rock horns, and we reached the top of the talus field at about 9 PM.  \
\
The hike out  proved to be long and confusing.  In the darkness we had a lot of trouble orienting ourselves amidst the seemingly endless talus and steep forest slopes.  We eventually spotted a camp fire somewhere in the Source Lake basin, and we just headed straight for it.  It took 2.5 hours and a lot of bushwhacking to eventually find the campsite.  The campers were evidently watching our headlamps slowly make their way down the talus field. They told us how to bushwhack straight upslope to reach the Snow Lake Trail, and within an hour and a half we reached the car, at 1 AM.  \
\
Lessons learned:  (1) we should have climbed faster, or turned around and gone home; (2) we should have researched our descent options better, to avoid guesswork about the correct gully; (3) we should have gotten an earlier start; (4) we should have carried more water-- 1.5 liters each was insufficient for a 17-hour day.\
\
Gear we used: 9mm x 50m double-rope (used the 2nd rope for the rappels);  BD stoppers up to #10; assorted hexes; #3 angle piton; #2 knifeblade"

\
We left late, which was dumb. I guess it was my fault. We shouldered our packs and were on the trail at 1:00 pm. Michelle set a strong pace and I followed. (On the trail, I had flashbacks to the infamous \""Alpental Ice\"" trip of last December, when a few UWCC'ers thrutched our way through chest-deep chowder snow while carrying along full ice-climbing kits, all the while looking for the mythical \""great ice at Alpental\"". Three or four hours later, soaked with sweat and having gotten absolutely nowhere (like, 1 mile), we turned back....)\

"peshastin-pinnacles","Peshastin Pinnacles","I bet lots of folks aren't aware of this area but Lilja and I went there today and had a good time. It's 10-20 minutes past Leavenworth, and gets very little rain. We basked in the sun all day, after leaving a thoroughly wet Seattle in the morning. The driving takes ca. 2.5 hours, about the same as Icicle Canyon. The details are in Kramar's Leavenworth guidebook.\
\
The climbing is OK, there are shitty sections of loose, flaky, crumbly rock with no useful pro except pin scars (we climbed some, Gary's aliens came in handy) but there are much bigger sections of quite nice slabs with shiny new bolts and double-bolt chain anchors (climbed some of those too, muchos fun). \
\
Peshastin is really cool for beginners - a lot of climbs in the 5.6-5.7 range (Leavenworth scale), not a lot of people, and the surroundings are really beautiful. You need to have someone that can lead though, because setting up topropes from above isn't easy."
,"Two thumbs up!","I have to agree with Stefan--the Peshastin Pinnacles is a great area!  If you want to practice your friction techniques, this is the place to do it.  \
\
I think the Pinnacles harbors several sandbags, however, so be careful when trusting the grades in Kramar's book—most are pretty much right on, but occasionally, one will bite you in the ass (e.g., Potholes; not too difficult, but seems harder than its given grade).\
\
For beginners, you have to check out the Tunnel Route on Orchard Rock—a classic Pinnacles 5.6—not too many routes out there where one gets an opportunity to climb through the rock.\
\
Also, there are tons of fun (albeit, runout) routes on Sunset Slab—an excellent beginners area.\

\
Our first target for the day was the Twin Cracks, three pitches, with the twin cracks being the second pitch.  Someone else was on the 5.easy pitch up to the base of the Twin Cracks, so we opted to do the Sickle Crack as the first pitch.  It is an upward-traversing crack/thin ledge with pretty much no handholds available.  Nice and balancy.  Some more climbing up, and a chance to head over to the line that enters Twin Cracks.  But the party was still on it, and instead, a  sweet handcrack (Pisces) presented itself.  I went up a few feet, popped in a cam, and continued going up, noticing the cam walking below me.  I freaked out a little, downclimbed, tried to set the cam better, gave up, and noticed that it would take a bomber hex.  The rest of the hand crack was awesome, and I arrived at the anchors, with the guy there telling me that we're above Twin Cracks already.  Oops.  \
\
Jule took the lead then and went the last pitch to the top, which had a slabby finish.

Jule got up about three or four moves before slipping off.  She probably could have done it with taped hands.  Then we tried Lizard.  There's an exposed undercling roof with no footholds.. Very fun to TR, but I would not want to lead it. <!-- s:) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\"" alt=\"":)\"" title=\""Smile\"" /><!-- s:) -->  By then another party was coming up, so Jule raced up Pisces, cleaned up, and rapped down.

\
From the top of the wall earlier in the day, we got a nice view of Mt. Index, and we decided to hike up to Lake Serene, which neither of us had done.  We stopped at the Index Cafe for ice cream and to verify directions to the TH.  We made good time on the trail (packs feel so nice without hunks of metal in them <!-- s:) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\"" alt=\"":)\"" title=\""Smile\"" /><!-- s:) -->), turned right at a fork, and ended up at Bridal Veil Falls.  Oops.  But the falls looked nice.  After that pleasant detour, we continued up to Lake Serene, ending on a gentle slab just above the water.  The peaks of Index towered above.  Totally awesome views.  I couldn't ask for much more -- great weather, great rock, a great hike, and a great partner."
"snowking-mountain","TR: Snowking Mountain","This is the story of how Kevin Steffa, Chris Cass, Mark Swanson, and myself conquered the evil Snowking and all of his henchmen including moss man, frost man, mud man, choss man, brush man, log man, and any combination of the above.\
\
The first 1.5 miles is very posh, maybe one of the best old growth forests I have ever seen.  Everything is covered with nice lively green stuff and a cushy trail to follow.  The first crux comes after slide lake where a series of catastrophic slides have destroyed the forest leaving the climber clueless as to where to travel.  It does not take long to lose the trail and here you are fighting through soaking wet brush, wet log crossings, huckleberry bushes, dense forest, and the almight moss man.  One would find the trail for a second only to lose it the next second.  This continued for a long time until finally the trail was found and no more slides to cross.  A steep trail later leads to enjar lake, very beautiful I might add.  To gain the high pass, there now was a ton of frosty choss in the way.  Boulder to boulder lead us to a minor crux, to traverse under a cliff where travel is steep dirt/heather/wet slabs until a nice bench is reached.  From there there is just some more choss, now snow covered and slipperty and a small glacier with some snow covered slabs(dry tooling was effective here) to the pass.  Camp was set, food was eaten, pictures were taken.  The next morning brought us to a traverse over the glacier which was mainly more choss and slabs (sorta the theme on this trip).  From a high col, more snowy, frosty, slippery choss brought entry onto the glacier.  After a few minute debate we decided not to rope up.  There was some fun optional steep snow/ice to climb.  A beautiful glacier, looked like a sweet ski descent, brought us to another col and where the summit lies.  Now there was only an hour left of choss/slabs/ridge climbing left.  Finally we all had lunch on the top.  Spectacular views of Baker, Shuksan, Eldorado ice cap, Cascade Pass, The Ptarmigen Traverse, Bukindy, Chaval, Glacier Peak, Bonanza,... There were some funny summit registers written up there.  One said something along the lines of, \""A beautiful view, but I'm here with my ugly companions.\""  \
\
Going down took half the time to come up. We saw the trail right away and were able to follow it this time.  The cruxes were easily downclimbed.  There was only some frosty/mossy logs to deal with.  We all had trouble with them.  You would be hiking and suddenly you would hear someone scream and it was one of us on the ground.  We all had trouble standing up on the wet/frosty/mossy/muddy logs.       \

"leavenworth-area-climbs","cragging at Leavenworth on Sunday","Ralph, Betsy, Kevin Ramsey, and myself went to Leavenworth Sunday to do some cragging.  We had some miscommunication with Stebbi, Lilja, Colin, and Lizzie, so unfortunately we did not meet up with them.\
\
We got to Leavenworth pretty early, but took a nice lazy nap and had a large brunch, so we didn't get climbing until about noon at Castle Rock (we didn't have a guidebook (oops), so we did climbs that we knew -- we asked the owner of the climbing store there for some easy trad routes and he suggested some 5.10s. <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\"" alt=\"":shock:\"" title=\""Shocked\"" /><!-- s:shock: -->  he also explained that the Leavenworth Guide was out-of-print, but Viktor Kramar, who was in the store then, would make a new one by spring). \
\
Castle Rock was suprisingly uncrowded, though we were stuck behind one slow party.  Ralph and Betsy jumped on Saber, and Kevin and I jumped on Midway.  After we topped out, we swapped routes.  It's a good idea to discuss some protocol for communication.  Both routes can be done in two pitches to the top with a 60m rope and good rope management.  But you won't be able to hear each other and may or may not be able to signal with rope tugs to each other.  \
\
I had a little annoyance on Midway... on the second pitch, I entered the wide crack a little too soon.  I traversed under a roof, gained the crack, and flipped the rope around... but it somehow got stuck in some undercling or something.  Neither my belayer or myself could flip it out or tug it out.  Not wanting to take a fall on a stuck rope, I popped in two pieces, equalized them, and downclimbed while anchored into those pieces.  Got the rope unstuck, flipped it over, and all was happy.\
\
Afterwards we went to Duckboy's Restaurant (I think) and sampled their Oktoberfest menu.  Good beer.  Embarrassing photo of me eating a bratwurst.  The menu wasn't very veggie-friendly for Kevin, so he got the $5 Apple Strudel.  Which was exactly two bites.  He wasn't pleased, so he asked if he could take it back.  Instead he got another two-bite strudel for free!\
\
Much thanks to Ralph and Betsy for driving and staying awake as Kevin and I fell asleep in the back."
,"Pictures","Pictures will be forthcoming (a few weeks), some beautiful country out there! The forests of Moss Mans domain were enchanting, dominated by large trees growing among mossy boulders (we didn't find any Ents or Entings, though...). The icy kings and queens of the cascades were brilliant in the fall light, as well as the icy glacier with the first touch of winter. Enjar was particularly enchanting, and even the slide paths with their treacherous slippery rocks and logs had gems hidden amongst their decay."
"mount-baker","Bouldering on the Coleman","Eight Climbing Clubbers played on the seracs on the lower Coleman glacier, below Mt. Baker, last Saturday. They were Rex Andrew, Rachel (what's your last name Rachel?), Jim Prager, Stefan Kebekus, Saint Touray, Matt Nelson, Matt's roommate, and I. Four people had never done something like that, and everybody had a great time. \
\
Rex and the four beginners spent the day learning, and Matt, Touray and I tooled around on easy stuff around them - nothing steeper than 70-80 degrees and nothing very tall. However, if you go further up there are bigger seracs, with both vertical and overhanging climbing... Wish I could go again next weekend, bring a rope and harness and play all day...\
\
One more thing - make sure you hit the glacier far down, Touray and I went up above the campsites and then had to get onto the glacier above the crappy cliff, and downclimb the seracs. It's scenic, but not that great."
,"Enchantments: Oct 12, 2002","&gt; Last Saturday (Oct 12) I day hiked through the Enchantments.  This is a\
&gt; bunch of lakes a few miles out of Leavenworth.  I was stressed out and\
&gt; figured a long hike alone was just the fix I needed.\
&gt;\
&gt; Man, was it gorgeous out there!!!   <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\"" alt=\"":shock:\"" title=\""Shocked\"" /><!-- s:shock: -->\
&gt;\
&gt; Nothing epic; nothing macho; no limbs lost.  Just beautiful lakes, a\
&gt; close encounter with a mama mountain goat and her baby, yellow larch\
&gt; trees, fragile ice patterns on the surface of still mountain lakes, blue\
&gt; blue water in other lakes, perfect sunny weather.  An excellent day hike\
&gt; if you're comfortable walking that far.  An excellent backpack for\
&gt; anyone.  An excellent intro hike if you want to take some beginners\
&gt; along and entice them a truly beautiful area.  Not ideal if you're\
&gt; looking for solitude, though, although I'd guess it's emptier in the\
&gt; winter.\
&gt;\
&gt; I started walking at 6am and turned off my headlamp half an hour later.\
&gt; I'd figured the slowish going would be the 3000ft (approx) ascent up to\
&gt; Snow Lakes, and later the steeper rocky descent down Asgard pass.  I was\
&gt; wrong.  The slow going was up the smooth gently uphill trail past the\
&gt; lakes, as I couldn't resist stopping to look and take photos.  I didn't\
&gt; see many people the first part of the day, but within a few miles of\
&gt; Asgard pass it seemed like there was always one party within sight.  No\
&gt; wonder it's a quota area for overnight camping.  I came out at the other\
&gt; trailhead at 6:15pm.  The smart thing would have been to stash a bike\
&gt; here and ride back to my car.  But alas -- I was here to get away, had\
&gt; been too stressed to think ahead that far, and for that matter hadn't\
&gt; exactly figured out how many miles it was anyway 'til after I'd started\
&gt; hiking.  (I'd brought my sleeping bag just in case, figuring that the\
&gt; less-than-3-lbs wouldn't slow me down much, and since I had no idea how\
&gt; far I was going it wasn't entirely improbable that I could get stuck out\
&gt; there for the night.)  So no bike at the trailhead at the end.  I\
&gt; started walking down the dirt road and was very excited when I was able\
&gt; to hitch a ride back to my car.  18 miles of trail had been just right;\
&gt; 8 more on road would have been annoying.  For ye who like numbers, the\
&gt; total elevation change was something between 5000ft and 6000ft.\

"big-four-mountain","Big Four Ice Caves 10/19","I bouldered for a couple of hours at the Big Four Ice Caves last Saturday. It was great, I didn't actually enter any caves but the remaining walls where the roof has already melted make for good vertical to overhanging traversing, and this is a perfect place to practice climbing over an overhang and exiting over the bulge. \
\
I'd have had more fun with a rope, the roofs of some of the caves are 30-40' off the deck and the surface underneath is too broken to risk falling that distance and landing on one's crampons or back. That was a bit of a bummer because it meant I missed out on trying the most overhanging parts - perhaps as much as 120 degrees! There were quite a few sections that had fairly flat landings though so plenty of opportunities to play. \
\
There was a party of Mountaineers there, they were funny. There were at least 10 of them.\

I'd like to go back up there soon. The hiking is only one mile and the trail is literally wheelchair-accessible (we saw a couple with a child in a stroller). The driving takes 90 minutes."
"the-tooth","TR: the Tooth (S. Face)","Trip Report of trip to The Tooth\
\
Short version:  we got \""rained out\"" after climbing the first pitch, but had a lot of fun\
\
Long version:\
\
With the Snoqualmie Pass forecast on Saturday calling for \""partly cloudy\"" and no precip, Elain and I decided it was time to go see the Tooth, and see what it's all about.  This was to be our first real \""rock climbing\"" experience in the mountains, so we were excited and a bit apprehensive.\
\
We loaded up our packs and ropes and headed up to Snoqualmie Pass.  The hike back in to the Source Lake basin went quickly enough, and the weather down in the valley was pretty good.  There were some misty looking clouds over the Tooth, but conditions were reasonably dry down in the valley.  On the hike up the long talus field to the basin under the East Face of the Tooth, we encountered a party of four heading up to the same place.  This was helpful because Elain and I were a bit unsure of the approach route, once we got over Pineapple Pass.  \
\
We soon found ourselves at the Notch, and settled in for a wait while the group of four got going.  While waiting, we saw a large Camalot fall down the South Face <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\"" alt=\"":shock:\"" title=\""Shocked\"" /><!-- s:shock: -->.  Once the group of four made it up to the first belay ledge, we set up our belay anchor and headed up.  The first pitch went very quickly.  The climbing was easy, and on reasonably dry rock.  Elain quickly got the hang of climbing on a double-rope system.  The only hitch we encountered was that I got my #2 Friend stuck in a (too small) crack, and could not retrieve it.  I left it for Elain to deal with on her way up, since she had the nut tool.  While Elain was climbing up and cleaning the pitch, it started to rain.  By the time she arrived at the belay ledge, the rock was starting to get pretty wet, and Elain's trail shoes were failing to get good traction.  With Elain's arrival, there were six people on the belay ledge, and it was very crowded.  Ropes and people all tangled up in a big mess.  The party in front of us was moving pretty slowly.  We decided that the most prudent thing was to bail, and to wait until another day to finish the climb.  We were disappointed becuase the climbing was fun and easy, and the two of us were making good progress.  As we had been promised, we found the Tooth to be very newbie-friendly.\
\
While rappelling down, Elain and I tried and again failed to remove the cam.  Finally, a group of two climbers who were rappelling past us offered to try and remove the cam.  I was very happy that they succeeded, and offered to double up with them, for the rappel down from the Notch.  From the Notch, we reached the talus with a 50-m (double-rope) rappel, and just a bit of down-clmibing on wet, mossy rock.  The hike out was uneventful, but very wet.  \

It took some looking around (during which we found an amazing, bottomless waterfall) to locate the perfect crevasse a few hundred feet out on the glacier. Its upper part was soft and forgiving, while the bottom 20 feet consisted of hard, vertical to overhanging blue ice which elicited a firework of flailing, grunting and scraping. We had a well balanced mixture of beginners, pretenders like me, and people who actually knew what they were doing - everybody learned something. Certain people even got this strange glow in their eyes, and it became shockingly obvious that they too had succumbed to this dangerous affliction.

"the-tooth","TR:  Tooth S. Face (part 2)","Trip report for climb of the South Face of the Tooth\
\
Short version:  the weather was excellent; we made it to the top\
\
Long version:\
\
After last week's attempt on the Tooth was rained out, Elain was anxious to try the Tooth again before winter arrives.  I was very skeptical that the weather would cooperate this late in October.  Elain showed me a trip report from Loren Campbell's web site describing a successful ascent in December, which put an end to my hand-wringing about the weather.  Surprisingly, the forecast was for \""partly cloudy\"" weather on Saturday, with no precipitation.  So Elain and I set out early for Snoqualmie Pass on Saturday 10/26.  We donned our headlamps and hit the trail at 6:20 AM.  We made quick time up to the Source Lake basin, and enjoyed a spectacular sunrise.  \
\
The climber's path up to the Tooth passed under a cliff band that was dripping with water and starting to ice over the trail.  While I was babbling excitedly about how cool it was that the waterfall was already frozen, Elain slipped and fell, badly bruising her arm.  She was not amused.  We continued making our way up the trail, until coming into the large talus field that leads up to Pineapple Pass.  At that point, we started to notice large swaths of the talus field were glazed over with a very thin layer of ice.  Our progress became very slow through the frozen sections of the talus field, because the rocks were so slippery.  We talked about whether it made sense to continue, and both of us felt that it was likely the South Face would be dry, despite the frosting that the talus field had received.\
\
After a long time spent picking our way through the partially frozen talus field, we finally made it up to Pineapple Pass, and shortly thereafter, to the Notch below the South Face.  We were happy to find that the South Face was dry.  After a bit of fiddling with ropes and the rack, we were on our way at about 9:30 AM.  So far, we had not seen any other climbers.  The first two pitches went fairly quickly.  At the second belay ledge, we were passed by a father/daughter climbing pair who were moving very quickly (relative to our speed).  \
\
The third pitch was mostly a scramble through easy terrain, and we soon found ourselves at the belay ledge beneath the final 50' wall guarding the summit.  At this point, I was really hoping that the father/daughter pair would be on that pitch, so we could watch to see their choice of route, but no luck.  They were already on the summit by then.  So I scanned the wall and tried to remember the diagram from Smoot's book.  There was indeed a small \""catwalk\"" like set of footholds traversing to the left, but I vaguely remembered that the catwalk route was not the easiest route to the summit.  Traversing off to the right didn't seem to offer much appealing climbing from my vantage point, but I couldn't see around the buttress on the far right, where the terrain might have been easier.  I assumed that beyond the buttress was the East Face.  Directly above me was a large slab shaped like the right-hand-edge of a diamond.  The slab traversed up and to the right, and then kicked back and traversed up and to the left.  Not seeing anything more appealing, I decided to try the slab.  The start was awkward and about 20' up the wall, I couldn't find any place to put in some protection.  At this point Elain, who had a front-row seat to my misery, called out something helpful like \""Maybe you should have traversed a lot more to the right, instead of climbing the slab.\""  I don't remember exactly what I said in reply, but it was very curt.  Finally the gap between the slab and the face narrowed to the point that it would take my #3.5 cam, which was a relief.  From there, I made my way up to a point just below the top of the wall.  There was a very large overhanging rock on the left, and a smaller rock on the right, and a small gap in between.  So I put in my #4 cam, crossed my fingers, and wriggled ungracefully through the gap.  I was on the summit shortly thereafter.  Elain made short work of the final pitch, except the final gap which was hard for her to squeeze through with the pack.  \
\
As we had been preparing all summer for this climb of the Tooth, we were very ecstatic to finally be on the summit.  The time was about 12:30 PM.  The weather was perfect-- the sun was warming the south face nicely, and there was no wind.  I pulled out a bottle of sunblock from the pack, and Elain and I laughed about the improbability of needing sunblock in late October.  Oddly, the father/daughter pair were nowhere to be found; we assumed they descended the northwest ridge, since we didn't see them rappel down the South Face.  Since no one else was up there, we set up the camera to do an automatic photo and posed in front of it, grinning ear-to-ear.  \
\
The descent was straightforward enough.  There were three climbing parties behind us, and we had to spend some time waiting for them.  But the weather was so nice that we didn't mind waiting at all.  After the second rappel, our rope knot got hung up on a ledge.  Fortunately this was the easy scrambling pitch.  As I was preparing to climb up to free the knot, a pair of climbers passed by on their way up, and freed it for us.  Two more rappels put us back at the Notch.  From there, we were down to the talus in one 50-meter rappel, with a bit of down-climbing at the bottom of the gully.  The talus field had mostly melted out, so we made better time on the descent.  \
\
At one point, Elain and I were split up, on opposite sides of a 100' long snow patch.   I was picking my way down the talus when I heard a shout.  I looked up and was horrified to see Elain sliding down the snow, out of control.  I saw her trekking poles skitter away from her, as she was sliding and trying to stop herself from hitting the rocks.  I couldn't see the spot where she hit the rocks, and was in a panic for a moment.  Shortly thereafter, Elain called out that she was unhurt.  I climbed down to her and we debriefed what had happened, while the adrenalin subsided.  Apparently she had thought it might be faster to do a sitting glissade down the snow.  She sat down on it, not realizing until too late that the snow was actually hard-packed ice.  As soon as she sat down on the snow, she started sliding and couldn't stop herself.  Fortunately, all she ended up with was a sore behind and torn pants.  \
\
We resolved to carefully descend the rest of the way to the trailhead.  Elain was sore from her fall, but we made steady progress.  We arrived at the trailhead just as the last of the twilight was fading, at about 6:45 PM.\

Guided by the moonlight, we made our way through pristine a pristine valley, and steadly made our way to Hannegan Pass. by daylight we reached the base of Ruth mtn.

"ingalls-peaks","Ingalls Way trail conditions","Was up on the Ingalls Way trail yesterday, checking out the approach to Ingalls Peak.  There was very little snow on the road to the trailhead, and the road was in good condition.  The trail up to Ingalls Lake was in fine shape, with just a light dusting of snow on the far side of Ingalls Pass.  This time of year, I recommend taking the high trail that traverses around the left side of the basin once you cross over the pass, rather than going straight down and across the basin-- there is less snow that way, and the trail is easier to follow, as a result.  Once you get to the other side of the basin, there are tons of cairns marking the trail up to the lake.  \
\
By the time we reached the lake, there wasn't (in our judgement) sufficient daylight to attempt the south ridge and make it back over the pass before nightfall, so we reluctantly turned and headed back at 2:00 PM.  On our way down from Ingalls Lake, we bumped into a pair heading up to climb the South Ridge of Ingalls.  Hope they climb fast."
"eldorado-peak","TR: Eldorado Peak via East Ridge","11/2-3\
\
Matt Peters, Phil Higuera, and I summitted Eldorado Peak via the famous\
knife-edge east ridge.  I had previously been up there, but it is a\
classic north cascades adventure.  Steep non-switchbacking climbing\
trails, lots of boulders leads to the cascade pass high country.  Eldorado\
and inspiration glaciers very straight forward.  The east ridge was a\
little icy, but not hard.  It seemed a little shorter then when I was\
there last, maybe because it is now november.  Summit views were\
outstanding, some of the best in the entire cascades.  The best part about\
it was that we didn't have to share the summit with anyone, a problem with\
some of the more popular routes.  Hiking out in the dark is now pretty\
typical due to the very short days.\

"ingalls-peaks","Ingals S ridge","Nick Bratton and I climbed the S. Ridge of Ingals on Sunday Nov 3. Very mellow and pleasant climb/scramble. \
\
We left the parking area around 7:15 and reached the base of the route in about two and a half hours, including some deliberation about which route to climb on the peak. It was still damn cold so we selected the S. ridge over the east. \
\
We climbed the route in two pitches, apparently skipping the 5.4 section somehow and summiting about 30 minutes after leaving the notch at the base of the route. Nonetheless, the summit was beautiful with great views of Stuart, and we were glad to be on our way down when another party showed up. \
\
With extra time on our hands we climbed a delightful three-pitch route on the peak just east of North Ingals peak. We started up the big, beautiful, obvious dihedral about 250 meters uphill form the lake. The rock quality was spectacular, as was the climbing. If we had had more time we would have kept going, but we decided to bail where the dihedral ended, and hike out while we still had some light. \

,"Middle Fork Majesty - Crawford Lake","Under the crags if Garfield we bounced along, around Dingford's corner and then down by the river. The middle fork road is made for truck commercials, and there were plenty folk on the road, most of them gun-slingers or hotspring soakers. The subaru poked along a few wavy-dippy sections in the road in low gear, but otherwise made it to the end all right. Views down the valley from the road are notable near the Dutch Miller trailhead. \
\
We headed up the valley and into the sunshine which broke the morning chill. The upper valley has many openings, slide paths and rockfields, and views of the waterslides in the river. In addition, it has recieved fresh maintennence and was wide as the PCT, overall a pleasant trail.  Up three miles we went until we reached a screefield off the trail a little past the outlet creek to the crawford lake.\
\
A short but invigoratingly steep scramble led to the forested ridge. Here the understory was quite open as we followed the ridgeline to the lake. Beargrass and a little huckleberry, but hardly anything requiring 'swacking. Views of the peaks were starting to appear through ample openings in the canopy. A little steep in the forest just before the lake, and here we ran into a few inch dusting of snow right before the the top.\
\
The lake is a real gem, dozens of small pocket pools amidst granite and heather clumps, just frozen over making for ideal  boot-skating. The 'Snoqualmie Pickets' dominated the horizon here, and the lake provided great reflections of Chimney Rock, Summit Chief, and Overcoat Peaks, as they took on a fine red alpenglow. A short scramble up slabs and boulders led to the ridge with more views of the 'lake district' on the north side.\
\
Plenty of entertainment to be had sliding around in the ice, sharing food, making espresso (courtesy of Ralph), bouldering on the knobs, and staying warm in general. Alas, not enough time to visit the hotsprings, as Mark, Stacy, and Sara had academic commitments back in town. Ralph, Lizzy, and I stopped down by a gravel bar in the river to take a closer look at the spires of Garfield in the evening light. \

Enough snow at paradise to put skiis on from the parking lot.  There was lots of snow in places, but once around the point, where winds increase, there were many exposed rock sections where some had to take off their skis.  After the rocky sections, there was more sections of more snow.  I think our group got up to around 8300 feet before wind, precip, decreasing visibility made us go down.  \
There probably was around 20 other skiers there that afternoon.  On the way down, we ran into some uw clubbers including Stebbi, Matt Nelson, Lizzy Hawker, and Wayne(also last name not known)."

There are many patches of wet snow covering the heather on the approach, so a trekking pole was real nice to keep from sliding around too much.  This is a very nice time of year for this climb, and as a bonus we got back to our car with some daylight to spare."
"lundin-peak","Snoqualmie-Lundin Nov. 23","Matt Truitt, Lizzy Hawker and I bushwhacked out of the Alpental parking lot up on to Cave Ridge, hiked from there to the summit of Mount Snoqualmie, and then climbed Lundin by the West Ridge. \
\
On the way back we used the Alpental-Snoqualmie trail, which is an unmarked climbers' path but pretty good. Has anyone here climbed the waterfall that trail crosses? Curious...\
\
The whole thing took 7 hours car-to-car at a leisurely pace, with some waiting on the summit of Snoqualmie for the clouds to part and show us Lundin. A set of stoppers and 5-10 single/double length runners is good. \
\
There is hardly any snow up there and we pretty much wore only our base layers while moving. Kinda warm... Red Mountain, the Chair and the Tooth are all pretty much snow free. \

,"Black Peak (South Ridge), Nov. 24","After some trip-planning chaos, Jule and I dove up to Rainy Pass Saturday and bivied at the trailhead.  After a largely sleepless night from wolves/owls and a jet that sounded like a Himalayan-scale avalanche and some freaky dreams, we awoke to the insides of our bivy  sacks coated in frost.  We got on the trail at 5 AM and warmed up quickly with our exertion.  Moonlight guided our way.  The trail was mosttly covered with consolidated snow, and we made good time to Heather Pass.  The traverse from Heather Pass to Wing Lake was covered with Cascades cement.  At times, just boots sucked.  At times, snowshoes sucked.  Most of the time, skiis sucked.  But screw the suckiness... the snow was just plain fun, and the snow was much more appetizing than talus slopes and dirty gullies.  And later on in the day, it made this refreshing styrofoam sound!  Avy danger was minimal, though we saw some debris from loose snow avalanches from earlier in the week.  Lewis Lake and Wing Lake were completely frozen over.  While scoping out the route at Lewis Lake, we saw an awesome meteor.  From Wing Lake, it's about a thousand feet of gain to reach the ridge, up a snow bowl.  It steepened to 40 degrees, and then at the ridge, even more because a cornice was forming.  Once we were on the ridge, we opted to stay on the snow slopes as opposed to the broken ledges.  The last thirty feet to the summit was 4th class choss.  We topped out at 11 AM to the best views we ever seen.  Three volcanoes, the Entiat Range, the Cascade Pass peaks, the Pickets, the Washington Pass peaks, all nice and snowy.  On the way down, we played around with gratuitous glissades (when you walk uphil to make more of the glissade) and failed miserably at curling (hey, we didn't bring brooms!).  We also discovered that climbing up steep firm snow with crampons is very different from climbing down steep firm snow without crampons. <!-- s:) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\"" alt=\"":)\"" title=\""Smile\"" /><!-- s:) -->   We were back to the car at 4 PM, exhausted after an amazing day on a nearly 9000 foot peak."

"sahale-mountain","Sahale Arm (Nov 30)","Well, this is the story of how big plans shrink and shrink and shrink, until only very small ambitions are left, which nevertheless provide lots of fun. My initial urge to check out Gib Ledges was met by only mild enthusiasm and some bailing out, so Aaron, Lizzy, Stebbi and I decided to go climb Mt Thompson. But during the foggy early morning hours we weren't able to find Aaron at the place where we thought he would be, so the car started driving  north and didn't stop until we got to the Cascade Pass trailhead (note: road is now closed from Eldorado TH). Our feet started walking, and walked several miles up the road, up the trail to Cascade Pass, and up onto Sahale Arm to almost the base of Sahale Peak. Stebbi's feet stopped walking sooner than Lizzy and Jule's feet, so we decided that we wouldn't push on to the summit and instead call it a leisurely day. The sun was warm, snow sloppy, and views were at the level of awesomeness we've come to expect during this funky year. \

"vesper-peak","Vesper Peak on Sunday Dec 8","Sunday, Dec 8, Daniel and I hiked up Vesper Peak, off Mountain Loop Highway.  It's 8-9 miles round trip and some 4000 feet of elevation gain.  The area is just gorgeous.  The trail weaves through some trees as it climbs, and then gently levels out onto a frosty valley bottom. It continues up the valley towards Headlee Pass.  The few hundred feet beneath the pass were hard almost-icy snow, but previous hikers had kicked steps so we ascended gingerly but without trouble.  After the pass (4600ft) the rocky trail dipped down gently into a small lake basin.  From here (say, 5200 ft) on to the top, we would be on snow. The first sections had been softened by the sun and we were just fine in hiking boots.  As we neared the top, however, we were quite happy to  have crampons and ice axes on the 35(?) degree snow.  The views were incredible in all directions; the air clear and crisp.  We could see \
Rainier and Baker and all the other mountains whose names I don't know. We had come up the east face, the easiest route up.

"johannesburg-mountain","Johannesburg Mountain - CJ Couloir (Dec 7)","After spending a lot of time gawking at the CJ couloir last week, I simply had to go climb it! Ryan agreed to join into the fun, but we were a bit worried about the climb. Many people have had bad (=near-death) experiences, and if you've ever seen or heard icefall crash down the couloir from the Sill glacier, you would question the sanity of the route a lot. But the coldish weather and lack of snow made it seem more reasonable.   \
We spent the night at the Eldorado trailhead, and set out at 4:45am with tons of steel and bivy gear on our backs. The plan was to climb to the top of the mountain, and then bivy on the way down wherever darkness would stop us. Getting to the base of the couloir took three miles of road hiking plus some mild bushwhacking and boulder-hopping across the valley, and at 7am our crampons started biting into rockhard, brittle ice. We were surprised and not very pleased by how hard it was. The upside was that we could trust the ice screws we placed for running belays, which isn't always the case in alpine ice. The climbing turned out to be a lot more fun and straightforward than anyone had expected: most of the crevasses were filled in by avalanche debris, nothing fell on our heads, and of course it wasn't as steep as it looks from the bottom. We simulclimbed the whole thing, with the steepest (and most fun) step being about 65 degrees. The couloir has a narrow waist which can be difficult when melted out, but we found ourselves pleasantly surprised. Sure enough, there was choss covered in drippy water ice, but only a short exciting step that involved drytooling and chimneying in a little waterfall. Above the narrow spot, we had to deal with more brittle water ice that had formed over the glacier, but the very top was all snow, and pickets came in handy. The couloir gains 3400 feet of elevation, and took us five hours to climb. We climbed pretty steadily, but one could be quite a bit faster if soloing, and carrying only day packs. \
We hung out at the col for a while and enjoyed the views, it was sunny and calm. Eldorado wore a veil of cloud. The rock above us looked steep and distinctly uninviting, and we could at the moment think of no reason why we should spend three hours climbing marginal, scary choss to get to the summit. Now of course I think we should've done it anyway. \
Instead, we plunged down the descent route of No Return. You must know that getting off Johannesburg is never easy: you can either go down the CJ couloir, which sucks, or make a long traverse around Mixup Peak to Cascade Pass, which potentially sucks, or descend the west ridge, which requires getting to the summit first, or go straight down to the Middle Fork Cascade River valley, which we found to moderately suck as well. At first you get to descend a gentle snow field and meadows, then follows fine bushwhacking for a couple thousand feet. We followed a creek bed and swung from slide alder to slide alder, then found some mature forest that allowed easier travel. Once we got to the valley bottom, we needed to only find the trail and then we'd be set. Finding the faint track involved lots more complex whacking, but it was really worth it. Now it was dark, and we had only 8 more miles to go! After five miles, we were back at the Cascade River road, dropped the packs and Jule, and Ryan heroically went by himself to get the car. \
Contrary to all fears, it turned out to be a really nice day climb with consequences no worse than some pain while walking and whiplash from the slide alder."
"mount-watson","Mount Watson - East Peak, Dec. 7","Matt Peters, Dan Perrakis and I set out for mount watson early saturday morning.  The road to the trailhead gains much elevation and eventually gains this plateau.  Due to extensive clear cutting there are great views of baker and shuksan from the road and trailhead.  A few mile hike past a few lakes, a snow gulley and a permanent snowfield traverse leads to the remnant glacier, which was more a pocket ice slab with deep moats on three sides.  It looked like a sharkfin sticking out of the rock.  It was actually pretty interesting.  We were trying to climb the west peak and searched a long time for the \""Obvious reverse z ledge system, one long lead\"" according to Fred.  We never found that(it was under snow), so we gained the col and did some class 3 scrambling with some hard tree,root moves and summited the east peak.  Great views of baker, shuksan, bacon, blum, the pt, glacier peak, snowking, etc.\

It was a a great time, pretty cas though."
,"TR:  Rainy Pass ice climbing","Last Friday, I went ice climbing up at Rainy Pass.   On the south side of SR20 at Rainy Pass, there is a trail that leads back to a lake (Rainy Lake, I think).  The lake was frozen, and easy to snowshoe across.  At the far side of the lake there was a 100m waterfall, I think it is called Rainy Falls.  The ice was in sort of \""early season\"" conditions, not very solid, and pretty inconsistent.  There was quite a bit of snow on the frozen ice so that you had to kind of \""dig\"" to find good depressions in the ice for tool placements.  I seconded two pitches and then we decided to rap down rather than finish the third pitch, in order to get back over Washington Pass before dark, to spend the night in Mazama.  \
\
Gear:  we used about six screws and a 60m single rope.  Used v-threads and large icicles for rap anchors.\
\
The plan had been to climb at Washington Pass on Saturday.  However, it warmed up a bit on Friday night, and started snowing heavily in Mazama and at Washington Pass.  On Saturday morning, we found that an avalanche at location \""LB1\"" (beneath Liberty Bell) on SR20 closed down Washington Pass.  Given the forecast, it seemed unlikely that Washington Pass would be re-opening until the spring.  The warmer temperatures on Saturday meant that ice climbing in Mazama was not an option.  So I had to take the long way back to Seattle, over Blewitt and Snoqualmie passes.  \
\
All in all, it was a very fun weekend, despite the high driving-to-climbing ratio."
,"Skiing above Paradise, Dec. 15","Dan, Michelle, Jean-Marie \""J-Mack\"" Stern, Emily, and I went down to MRNP to ski between winter storm fronts.  The avy forecast was cause for concern, so we abandoned thoughts of going to the Tatoosh Range for the more mellow southerly slopes above Paradise.  We didn't make it up to Camp Muir, but had a good time skinning up to above McClure Rock, where we looked for a good run in the poor visibility.  After eating spindrift sandwiches at lunch in a snow cave, the boys headed out, seeking unknown freshiez, while the girls reversed our ascent path back to the steep run near Pebble Creek.  (Aha!  No wonder 93% of avalanche victims are men!)  It was snowing and blowing a good part of the day, and Dan skied over a recent 1' slab fracture line on the way out.  Aside from prematurely-releasing randonee bindings, my faceplant practice, a broken heater fan in the Volvo, and a tangled tire chain, it was all dandy."
"guye-peak","Guye Peak North Something Rather Couloir (1/11/02)","Dan, Stebbi and I put up a new variation on the northwesterly aspect of Guye Peak! It was of course all on purpose and well planned out from aerial photos and inspection of the route by telescope. \
We started straight up from the Alpental parking lot and ascended a steep gully to the broad northwest shoulder of the peak, and then traversed right on tricky slabs to a sharp rib above a deep gully, then crept along the rib until it met up with the easy northwesterly summit slope. You won't know what I mean by this, but at least we figured out at the end where we went. And of course everyone in the party will have a different take on this and say that my description is all wrong. \
The initial gully provided 4-5 pitches worth of up to 70 degree water ice, styrofoam snow, and crap mixed together. Some protection was available in the thick ice on the left side, and via pickets, and we used a mixture of belayed and simulclimbing. After we came out of the gully, we traversed steep slabs toward the west which we thought might get us to the summit. They had lots of rotten, unconsolidated snow on them, but we thought it was all fine and dandy until we found ourselves gaping into a big chasm. That was pretty cool. The climb had gotten interesting all the sudden. Belayed from a bomber Christmas tree on a knife edge ridge, Dan led out to traverse the side of the sharp fin toward the summit. Some mixed climbing with exposure and spicy slippage got us to a place where we could take off crampons and walk to the summit. The summit was lower than the other mountains around it. We slid down to the parking lot in 40 minutes."

I wiped out at the top of Pan Point, ripping several screws out of the binding, and postholed back to the car in knee-deep pow until I got to the boottrack.  They did some more runs.

"mount-rainier","Mt Rainier - Ingraham Indirect (2/9/03)","The story of a long, fun weekend.\
\
Nick Bratton, Dan Perrakis, Andy Lewis and I drove to Paradise on Friday afternoon, which went really well because we took the quickest route possible. We made our snuggly home on the parking lot, and promptly were apprehended by Ranger Chris. She was very cool though and just told us to watch out for the snowplowman. \
It was a cold night, but fun was had by all. Dan initiated us to some bizarre, Canadian I must assume, drinking games which we played without drinking because the beer would need to be saved for later. \
\
On the next morning, the hike up to Muir was a battle of different modes of transportation: snowshoes, tele skis, AT skis, and petite French skis. Unfortunately, the people with just feet won, because the snow was all hard. We had no problem finding room in the hut, but as the afternoon wore on, the place became packed. Mild panic started to set in, and visions of snowslogging in a mule train made us decide to leave really really early for the summit. \
\
That motivation was a little dampened by the wind that was shaking the outhouse severely throughout the night. We ended up starting out at 2am on Sunday, a little disoriented after steeping in all sorts of fumes in the hut. At least four teams were leaving at the same time, but once they hit the Ingraham Glacier, the winds made most turn around. Nick fearlessly led us up to  the snow ridge just above the DC, but there my everso intelligent friends decided they'd had enough of the darkness, uncertainty and cold. I dutifully complied and trudged on down, only to run into my old friends Howie and Louie, who were nice enough to let me jump on their rope. Lynn, the third member of their team, hadn't been feeling well and subsequently ended up hanging out with the rough crowd at Paradise. \
 \
We first tried to do Ingraham Direct. While we were working up the steep slope that gets you from the glacier onto the upper mountain and kicking loose little slabs, an airplace roared overhead and we got the hell out of that dangerous place. We went back up to the spot above the DC where I had first turned around. By now there was some daylight, and we could see a good line trending east. At 12,500' the wind had gotten pretty bad, but the wind-packed sastrugi (profigliano!) made for good hiking. It felt like a true Alaskan/Arctic experience. The wind blew us back toward the South side of the upper mountain, and we were pretty exhausted when the crater rim finally showed up at the horizon. The last 300 feet of elevation win the prize for ridiculousness: the wind was gusting at 60mph minimum, forcing us down on our hands and knees. I collapsed every twenty feet or so, panted, laughed madly, and carried on. We were pretty glad to reach the crater rim, and didn't feel like crossing the mad cauldron of a crater just to go sign the register. \
It took 9 (!) hours to get up, and 3 1/2 to get down to Muir. Other than the wind, conditions were splendid with firm snow and minimal crevasse problems. It seemed like we were the only ones that made it on the weekend - or were we?\
\
The descent to Muir was easy enough, but clouds and darkness blew in while we came down the Muir snowfield. By now, the three guys and Lynn had been waiting at the parking lot for many hours. I felt guilty, but knew that they were creative and would figure out a way to entertain themselves, or abandon me. I raced on down by myself, got lost, got angry, and prepared to bivy. Fortunately, the trucks lights shone through the thick fog like a rescue beacon at sea, and all was good and happy again. Then Andy played some voodoo that was frankly beyond me. It caused Howie and Louie to show up, whom we had given up on. \
Back in Seattle, Atlantic Street Pizza provided us with much-needed fat and beer, and the story ends here."

"chair-peak","Chair Peak - N Face (3/1/03)","Stebbi, Paul and I finally managed to climb the thing, and it was pretty cool. A beautiful, crisp day with safe avy conditions and good snow cover on the route made it all possible. \
Getting to the start took some fun powder wallowing. Paul won the moderate battle over the first lead, and cruised up the first pitch without wasting time on pro. We were granted a few swings on real water ice, the rest was frozen snow and stuff. The next two pitches turned out more exciting than they looked, because the snow was steep, deep and unconsolidated, with no pro whatsover except for the little trees here and there. Some swearing and grunting occured. \
I led the last pitch up to the summit ridge and to the top of the mountain. This involved finally good pro in the rock (using cams, nuts, and pin), some more light tunneling through the cornice on the ridge, and some gnarly mixed on the summit block. Of course we could've gone around to the left and just walked up to the summit, but those last 30 feet were actually quite fun. \
We waffled around a bit looking for the descent gully, until we just did what the description said (walk over the false summit, and there you are). After walking the first half and rapping the second half (a cool slot gully, a 60m double rope rappel got us down easily), we were spat out into the E bowl. I had stashed my skis at the base, but due to much bumbling and falling down wasn't much faster than Paul and Stebbi in getting back to the car.     \
A lovely day! Pictures may follow at an unspecified time."
"leavenworth-area-climbs","Levenworth TR 2003","While most of the UW climbers went to Vantage, Me, Aaron Z. and Alex left the U district at 6:30 am for Levenworth!! the weather was snowy and cloudy all the way over Stevens pass. We arrived at L worth around 9:15 am to discover partly cloudy skies and no crowds of climbing bums. After hiking 30 mins we found ourselves a nice 5.9 crack near Purina Crags. Alex completed his first ever 5.9 rock climb outside of the gym, and we all had fun on this sweet crack. \
   After messing around on the rocks above purina crags, we showed Alex how to rappell and belay a leader. We all had fun, not to mention there were hardly any climbers in sight, just the way I like it. during the day it began to snow off and on very lightly, yet the sun was beating down on us at the same time. \
   We found a few more easy pitches above bolt rock and spent a considerable amount of time coaxing Alex off a rappell! not bad for his first time =). All and all it was a great trip and we all had fun. we finally left the crags around 4, and headed to macdonaldes to eat 99Cent Double Cheesburgers. We needed the protein!!!

"colchuck-peak","TR:  Colchuck Peak via Colchuck Glacier / East Ridge","Short version:  we bailed on the North Buttress Couloir after one pitch, and did the scramble route instead\
\
Long version:\
\
Elain and I had hoped to climb the North Buttress Couloir on Colchuck this weekend.  We left Seattle Friday night, and slept at the Bridge Creek campground.  We were awakened at around 5:30 by the sound of loud music, coming from a truck that had parked behind us; a pair of climbers/skiers were enjoying their tunes while organizing their gear.  Figuring this was a good time to get moving, we started sorting our gear also.  Although Elain and I had made a real effort to pare down our gear to the bare minimum, our packs still seemed comically heavy for the length of the first day's carry.  Despite our best intentions, we fell *far* short of the \""fast and light\"" ideal.  At 7 AM, we started trudging up the 4-mile road to the Stuart Lake trailhead, reaching the trailhead at 9 AM.  The temperatures had been fairly cold Friday night, and the trail was hard-packed and icy through the forest.  The trail was snow-covered from the trailhead all the way to the lake, but snowshoes were not needed to get to Colchuck Lake, due to the cold temperatures and lack of recent snowfall.  We did use our snowshoes to walk along the edge of the lake, although they were almost certainly not necessary.  The lake was still frozen solid, but large parts of it were bare, blue ice.  We reached the far side of Colchuck Lake at 1 PM, and dug out a platform amidst the snow-covered boulders beside the lake.  While we were setting up camp, we chatted with a young kid (we later found out his name is Colin) who was planning on climbing the Northeast Buttress Couloir on Colchuck.  He gave us some very useful information on the North Buttress Couloir, for which we were very grateful.  It took about three hours to make camp, melt drinking water, and boil water for dinner.  By about 4 PM, it started to snow.  We huddled in the tent and studied the map and a photograph of the route.  Through the night, the amount of precipitation increased a bit.  We were both very tired from the day's load-carrying, but having made camp so early, were able to get quite a bit of rest.\
\
At 4:15 AM, we were up and moving.  It appeared as though 3-4 inches of new snow had fallen during the night.  Visibility was still pretty decent, and the precipitation had subsided a bit.  Temperatures were pretty cold, and we decided to stick with our original plan to go up and check out the Couloir.  We started climbing at 5:15.  The going was a bit slow because of the new snow, and the fact that many of our steps were breaking through the crust into the unconsolidated snow underneath.  By about 6:45 AM we had reached the entrance to the North Buttress Couloir.  At this time, Elain spotted Colin climbing up to the entrance to the Northeast Buttress Couloir.  He was climbing solo, and moving very fast.  We found that the snow in the gully was steep and not very well consoliated, but not terrible either.  We resolved to go up one pitch and see whether the snow conditions got any better, further up.  So we broke out the rope and I started climbing up, using a picket for protection near the top of the pitch.  The angle steepened and the snow was  not very good for cramponing.  There was a 1-2\"" crust with mostly unconsolidated snow underneath.  At the top of the pitch, I decided that conditions were not right for our attempt on the couloir, and started downclimbing.  After some discussion, Elain and I decided to climb the Colchuck Glacier route instead.  After a rest break and some time spent down-climbing and traversing over to the Colchuck Glacier, we were on our way up the glacier at 8 AM.  There was quite a bit of new snow on the glacier, with a the same crust underneath.  The crust would sometimes hold our weight, but we were often breaking through.  This made  trail-breaking somewhat arduous.  While on the glacier, we encountered Colin, who was speed-glissading down the glacier, returning from his ascent of Colchuck.  He seemed to be in a hurry.  We kicked steps for what seemed like an eternity, finally reaching the Col at 11 AM.  Just below the Col, the sun came up over Dragontail, and it was nice to finally warm up.  At the Col, we dumped my pack and broke out the rope, setting up a 50' section of rope for simul-climbing.  We traversed over to the steep snow slopes southwest of the Col, and started climbing up.  At this point, the south-facing snow slopes had been warmed quite a bit by the sun, and were getting wet.  Our crampons were balling up, and this made the traversing difficult.  In frustration we removed our crampons and started climbing up.  Further up, the snow became much more hard-packed, and we regretted having removed our crampons.  We kicked steps and made our way up, generally avoiding the rocks and sticking to the open slopes.  By about noon, we were about 200' below the summit, and at the point where the slope angle kicks back.  At this time, it had clouded over, and was snowing quite a bit.  After some discussion, we decided to turn back, in order to ensure that we would be able to return to the car before nightfall.  Downclimbing from our high point was stressful and took a while, because of the loose snow.  We eventually reached the Col at about 12:45 PM, and bumped into the climber/skier pair.  They told us that Colin was planning to climb the Triple Couloirs route on Dragontail, that afternoon.   <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\"" alt=\"":shock:\"" title=\""Shocked\"" /><!-- s:shock: -->   They were grateful for the steps we had kicked in, from the Lake to the Col.  Elain and I downclimbed the glacier, which was pretty easy going until we reached the lower slopes, where there was a lot of avalanche debris covered by new snow.  We finally reached camp at about 2:15 PM.  At 3:15 PM we were packed up and on the move, snowshoeing along the edge of the lake.  While downclimbing the steep trail below the lake, we were passed by Colin.  He confirmed that he had climbed the Triple Couloirs after finishing the Northeast Buttress Couloir on Colchuck, before resuming his speed-glissading down the trail.  [We later learned that he had actually passed one or two other parties on the Triple Couloirs. ]  \
\
Perhaps the only positive thing that can be said about the rest of the hike out, was that it was \""character building\"".  \
Elain set a punishing pace, no doubt motivated by the thought of fast food in Leavenworth.  We reached the Stuart Lake trailhead at 5:45 PM, and after a short break, resigned ourselves to the long slog down the road.  We reached the car at about 7:30 PM.\

"the-feathers","Vantage 4/5","Mark Orr drove Masha, Brian Lucena and myself up to Vantage Saturday. We had a great day climbing at the Feathers, each of us climbed 5-10 short pitches. The weather was nice, a little nippy in the wind but nothing to complain about. \
\
On the north side of the Feathers I think we did all the routes between the walk-through and Becky's Route. A couple of those were fairly nice. Both are on the column that makes up the west wall of the walk-through gap, I can't remember the one name but it's 5.7 (Mandatory Suicide perhaps?) and the other is Desert Shield (5.10a). \
\
I also climbed one route on Satan's Column, the 5.8 arete that starts out quite nicely but becomes a disappointing choss heap for the last 20' or so. \
\
On the south side we climbed the two routes that are closest to the walk-through, at 5.8 and 5.10a I think. \
\
All the bolts were fairly solid, I ran into a couple of spinning hangers but nothing worse than that - other than the usual Vantage deal, bolts in choss. \
\
All-in-all a great day. Brian was just learning to belay, which was cool.  \
\
Gary et al., which routes did you guys do?"

I climbed in Leavenworth on Sunday after the soggy evening and managed to have a really nice day as well. After we dried him out from sleeping under my truck, we dropped Nick off at the Pinacles for API trining fun. Ben and Tracy Lockard and Marcie and I journeyed out to castle rock around 9:30am as we though it would dry out faster than most other spots. We were sort of right. While three parties (in a daytona beach sense of the term) of mountaineers stromed the cliff, we climbed Crack of Doom, which was really nice, even though the wind and spitting rain made it a bit more exciting that I would have liked. A steady rain around 12 sent us fleeing to town for coffee and cookies. We then headed out to the Icicle butress to find that the sun had returned! Marcie and climbed Cocaine connection to Cocaine Crack, a beautifal, slabby, splitter finger crack. This pitch was well worth the wandering/non-descript approach and finish pitches! \

,"Lake Chelan Lakeshore Trail","If anyone is looking for a good early season backpacking trip I just did the Lakeshore trail on Lake Chelan and would highly recommend it.  The snow is completely gone, flowers are starting to come out and its on the east side of the crest so there's less chance of rain.  Getting to the trailhead is complicated by the fact that it requires taking the ferry from Chelan up to Prince Creek, but then its a beautiful 17 mile hike to Stehekin where we caught the ferry back to Chelan. The views north to McGregor and Boston as well as the local Sawtooths made for some great photo opts.\

"colchuck-peak","TR Colchuck peak and missing gear!","Me and Aaron Zabrinski left 8 mile creek road at 2:30 am monday morning. We wanted to climb the North buttress on colchuck peak in one day, so we decided that we should have an early start. Unfortunately the gate was closed, and we had to hike an extra 4 miles or so. Lucky for us it only took an hour to reach the real trailhead. After stripping down, we made our way up to Colchuck lake in no time. In my haste and hurry I did not drink any water, or eat any food in the first 8 miles. As soon as we got to the bottom of the North buttress I had a tight cramp in my right leg, and I threw up last nights tuna fish sandwhich. I decided that I did not want to continue. And we ditched the North buttress so that Aaron can climb Colchuck glacier on his own just so the trip wouldn't be a waste. We only saw 2 other climbers the whole day.\
       As I made my way down, Aaron made his way up. Aaron decided to turn around at 9:30 am so we could be back in Seattle by 4:00. Unfortunately for both of us, Aaron dropped his helmet along with his headlamp, and somehow I managed to lose my ice axe when i got back to the car. When I went back to look for it, it was gone. I hope no sport climber, or disgruntled ranger stole it =).. . If anyone happens to be down at 8 mile road in leavenworth please let me know if u find anything.

"leavenworth-area-climbs","Leavenworth and Drier Points East, Apr. 12-13","I enticed Dan to join me on a trip out to Leavenworth, promising a full two days of climbing on beautiful granite.  We drove through the rain near Index Saturday morning but our spirits lifted when the sky got drier as we crossed the pass.  We met up with Aaron and his girlfriend at the 8-Mile campground, where they had been harrassed by the fascist camp steward fellow for not paying the fee.  The rain returned.  We idled away the morning, eating breakfast (again) in der Stadt and playing human Jenga.  Tempting fate, we drove out to Castle Rock, but wetness fell again from the sky as soon as we entered Tumwater Canyon.  \""We're not climbing in this shit,\"" said we.  The air to the east smelled drier, so we followed our noses through the ghostly-white orchards of Peshastin until we reached the fabled Pinnacles.\
\
After our first pitch, the weird and unsatisfyingly short Tunnel Route, the last sprinkles faded away.  The sun peeked out with increasing curiosity at our antics.  Dan flailed up a godawful vertical sandbox for his turn at leading, then Aaron followed with much cursing while I took photos.  Aaron's buddy had recommended Lightning Crack, so we headed there next.  That single worthwhile pitch of the day was a full 60m of decent climbing.  We rapped off the back after Dan retreated from an uninspiring anchor at the top of the formation.  The last 20 feet to the top is not worth the trouble.\

\
One advantage of a sandstone climbing area: the trails are made of, well, sand.  You can walk around barefoot comfortably.\
\
Back at camp, we hadn't had enough, so Dan and I walked down the way to 8-Mile Buttress, where I led Classic Crack by headlamp.  It was jamtastic.  Dan cleaned and walked off in the dark.  I almost called in the choppers when he wasn't back after a few minutes, but he had just taken the longer way around.\
\
We talked around the campfire after dinner and agreed that we'd try for Outer Space tomorrow... if the weather looked good.  Sometime during the night, the rain came down hard.  We all slept in.\
\
Dan and I headed to Frenchman's Coulee since the weather wasn't improving during breakfast.  I still get amazed at the climate change as I make the drive eastward.  We arrived to full porta-potties at the packed parking lot.  Somehow we got right on Party in Your Pants, narrowly eluding the crowds.  Next we did George and Martha, then Seven Virgins and a Mule.  Fun fun fun.  I dropped my ATC into a crack between columns at the top while getting ready to rappel, so we spent quite a while trying to get it out.  I finally succeeded using my nut tool on a bight of rope.  My arms were scraped pink from digging around in the narrow crack.\
\
Dan tried Mr. Clean, a thin, hard finger crack with a scary approach (step over a cleft between columns and belay with your back to a huge chunk of teetering basalt held in place by some loophole in the gravitational laws).\
\
We then did our good deeds for the day: I trundled a big piece of loose rock from near Mr. Clean and Dan led Steel Pulse to retrieve a quickdraw for another party, who gave us extensive unnecessary beta on how to belay the pitch and get to the first bolt.  Stuck-Quickdraw Guy gave Dan a sandwich for his trouble.\
\
The sun was setting, so we hiked back to the car and had a beer.  Dinner was at the Bar 14 in Ellensburg.  Good times."
,"climbers trail","Hey Erick\
\
The road is melted out for about 2 miles id guess, but the ranger told me they were not going to open it till the middle of May at the earliest. After that there are occasional patches of snow, and then the last 1.5 miles is all snow. the snow is nice and crunchy, so it shouldnt be a problem, it might take an hour or so/or less to reach the actual trailhead. As far as the trail to colchuck lake goes, it is fine, lots of hard snow. U can see the boot tracks of all the other climbers leading to the lake.. We had no problems route finding. I would not even waste the time carrying snow shoes ud only suffer hauling them on u'r back. The North buttress looked good when we were there. There was plenty of snow and ice covering up all the ugly stuff underneath. Im sure in a few weeks, or even a month from now things will be alot uglier.\

"colchuck-peak","TR:  Colchuck North Buttress Couloir","After two previous trips to Colchuck Peak during the past two weekends,\
Elain and I were anxious to finally climb the North Buttress Couloir (NBC).\
I packed the car well in advance of the weekend and waited for the\
weather forecast.  To our surprise, the weekend forecast for Leavenworth\
on Friday looked good, partly cloudy on Saturday and Sunday with little\
chance of precipitation.  The temperatures looked as though it would\
be cold enough for our attempt.  So we decided to go.  Early Saturday \
morning before we left Seattle, the temperature in Leavenworth was 30F.  \
We drove to the Bridge Creek Campground, resigned to a 4-mile approach\
walk to reach the Stuart Lake trailhead.  We arrived at the campground\
at 7:30 AM.  To our amazement, the gate across Eightmile Road at the\
creek had been opened.  This was the first sign of good fortune for our\
trip.  We drove up the road for 2.5 miles and reached the snow line.  At \
this point there were tire tracks through the snow.  I hesitated, because \
the Saturn has low clearance and poor traction.  Elain balked at the idea \
of accepting defeat so easily, and ordered us onward.  So we plowed ahead\
through the snow for another quarter mile, and finally came to a point\
where several SUVs were parked.  \
\
We were on our way by 8:00 AM.  The hike in was uneventful, and because\
of the cold temperatures the previous night, everything was frozen.  The\
trail was easy to follow in boots, except for the occasional icy patches.\
On the trail, we encountered a party of three who had just climbed the \
NBC.  They told us stories of copious spindrift dumping on them constantly\
during their ascent, and of the great exposure and \""talcum powder snow\"" \
they encountered on the West Face.  Our eyes grew wide at their \
description, but we reminded ourselves that several other climbers had \
characterized the route as quite moderate.  The climbers also gave us \
pointers for routefinding  on the West Face of Colchuck, which helped \
our confidence level.\
\
We reached Colchuck Lake at 12:00 PM, and debated about where to make \
camp.  Finally we decided to take advantage of the extra time in the\
afternoon, and camp higher up.  So we hiked up the snow slopes above\
the lake.  We started out in snowshoes, which was a comical disaster.\
The slope was too steep and the snowshoe tines were raking right\
through the slush.  With my heavy pack, I fell over like Humpty-Dumpty.\
So we dumped our snowshoes, cursing ourselves for having brought\
them.  About halfway up the slopes, we bumped into Ralph Bodenner\
and Erik (?), who were on their way down from an ascent of Colchuck\
Peak via the West side.  At 1:00 PM we reached a broad basin at about\
6300'.  We decided to make camp on the edge of the basin farthest\
from any avalanche debris.  From our campsite, it looked to be just a 30-minute\
walk to the base of the North Buttress Couloir.  We had an excellent\
view of the entire couloir.  As we made camp, the sun was shining and\
there was no more than an occasional faint breeze.  When I started \
building a large snow wall around the tent, Elain questioned my \
sanity.  Undeterred by the obvious signs of stable weather, I built a \
large wall on the southwest side of the tent, intending to deflect wind\
from what I presumed would be the prevailing direction.  With many of\
our previous camping experiences having foregone a hot meal, we decided\
this time to make a hot dinner.  Perhaps we are getting soft in our old \
age.  After its customary sputtering and crankiness, the old XGK stove \
roared to life, halting any conversation.  After dinner, we sorted and \
packed our gear for the ascent.  During the night, the weather remained \
stable with minimal wind.  We briefly studied the map to familiarize\
ourselves with the route and the features of the couloir.\
\
At 3:30 we woke up and started getting ready for our ascent.  By 4:00 we\
were on the move.  It was cold, but the skies were clear and we could\
see the route via the starlight.  At first we were moving very slowly,\
lacking in caffeine and somewhat bleary-eyed from the early hour.  \
We trudged upward through a small swath of avalanche debris, and \
eventually got into the couloir.  Here we roped up and started simul \
climbing, and our pace quickened.  Although we were the first party \
heading up the couloir that night, we could occasionally make \
out the faint tracks of the previous day's ascent.  Mostly the old \
tracks had filled in with spindrift.  The snow was mostly firm and\
with a crust that was good for step-kicking.  We opted not to place \
any running protection in the couloir, except for clipping a tattered \
piece of webbing that we found frozen to a rock about halfway up the \
couloir.  We found that it was faster to climb without a running belay, \
and to use the tool and axe (both shafted in the snow) for self-belay.  \
Just above the rock with the frozen webbing, at what we judged to be \
the steepest part of the couloir, Elain decided it was vitally important \
to have a bite to eat.  Seeing no kind of ledge nearby, I grudgingly \
kicked a small platform and put in a picket and belayed her up to me.\
So we perched together on the steep slope and munched M&M's and gulped\
some water from our partially frozen water bottle.  Not wanting to get\
cold, we quickly resumed climbing the couloir.  Elain and I had forgotten\
our camera, and I was disappointed I could not snap a picture of Elain\
climbing up the couloir in the early dawn light.  Elain told me that\
she was getting pelted with quite a bit of ice as I climbed, so I tried\
to be more careful as I kicked steps in the snow above her.\
\
We climbed for another hour and a half, and just before I reached the \
\""notch\"" at the top of the couloir, the sun broke over Dragontail and \
started shining on us.  At about that time, Elain got beaned in the face\
with a piece of ice that I had dislodged, and was ready to be done with\
the couloir.  At the notch there was a small tent-sized snow \
platform, and I plopped down there and belayed Elain up to me.  The time \
was about 7:00 AM.  Looking down, our tent was a tiny yellow speck.\
We saw a party of approaching the base of the couloir, 1500' below.\
We gaped for a moment at the awesome sight of snow-covered Mount Stuart.\
Looking south, we observed tracks traversing up and across the West Face, \
just as Beckey describes in his book.  We followed the tracks up and \
around a rocky corner and out onto the West Face.  From there, we \
continued the traverse upward, occasionally placing rock protection \
for a running belay.  We followed the steps in the snow up into a gully,\
and tried to make out which of the several rocky pinnacles we observed\
was the summit.  From my altimeter, it appeared that we should be very\
close to the summit.  I was feeling dehydrated and a bit nauseus;\
we had tried to keep moving in order to avoid getting cold, and had not\
drunk enough water.  At the top of the gully, the tracks veered right\
and we reached a small ledge, from which we observed the true summit\
pinnacle, at least a hundred feet higher.  Cursing our altimeter,\
we swallowed our disappointment and continued up towards the summit.\
\
Just below the summit pinnacle, the tracks forked, one set of tracks\
going left and one set of tracks going right.  I saw a cairn on the\
left set of tracks, so I tried those first.  The tracks dead-ended at\
a cliff.  After staring in puzzlement at the cairn for a bit, I \
retraced my steps and tried the other path.  The tracks eventually\
switchbacked through some rocks, and led to a small notch.  I could\
barely squeeze through the notch with my pack, rack, and pickets.  \
On the other side of the notch, I looked out and observed the unmistakable \
summit ridge of Dragontail, and below me a wide expanse that I figured\
must be the broad plateau on the south side of the summit.  Turning\
right, I scrambled the last few feet up to the summit.  Checking\
my watch, the clock read 9:00 AM, and the cursed altimeter said 9900';\
I must have botched it when I calibrated it in the pre-dawn darkness. \
\
As I belayed Elain up to the summit, the rope drag was severe, so I had no choice but \
to just pull as hard as I could on the rope, knowing Elain would be \
annoyed at the rope tugging on her during the rock scramble.  Elain\
soon joined me on the summit.  It was windy and cold, and the sun\
was now behind the clouds.  We looked over to Mount Rainier, which\
was covered in a nasty-looking lenticular cloud, and were grateful \
not to be high on that peak, at that moment. After re-racking our\
pro, we had a quick bite of food and some water, and started our descent.\
The descent was surprisingly quick and easy.  The cold temperature had\
made the southern snow slopes quite firm, and it was easy cramponing\
all the way down to the Dragontail-Colchuck Col.   Just before we reached\
the col, the sun came out.  At the col, we basked in the sun and took\
another quick water break before starting down the glacier.  We reached\
the tent at about 10:30 AM.  We took our time packing up our gear,\
and commenced the long hike back to the car.  The hike out was tiring,\
and we were grateful to avoid the final 2.5 miles of hiking along\
Eightmile Road.  On the hike out, we bumped into the party we had\
seen entering the couloir below us, and they gave us a mitten that\
Elain had somehow dropped while hiking down from Colchuck Lake.\
We were not moving very fast on the hike out; we reached the car at\
just after 5:00 PM.\
\
Gear we used:  1 picket, #5 short knifeblade, small stoppers, 2\"" hex;\

"sahale-mountain","TR: Sahale Peak (not!)","Jen Gregory, Andrew Grautstien (sp?) and I coordinated a trip to Sahale, via the Sahale arm and glacier from cascade pass.  This was after Jen had announced she wanted to do Mt. Daniels in another thread, and everyone wanted to join in, but on a different weekend.\
\
So with our new destination in mind and map in hand, we set out bright and early on sat morning, zooming from seattle to hwy 2 and the cascade river road.  the marblemount ranger station was closed, no beta there.  but the road was open all the way to boston creek, only 2mi short of the parking lot.  That's a lot closer than the eldorado gate, which was where it was closed the previous week.\
\
Shortly before we made it to the eldorado gate my truck suffered a punctured tire...a gnarly gash on the inside sidewall, from the rim to the tread on the left rear tire.  I swapped it out with the spare, once again noticing that I only have a small donut spare and not a full-size spare.  I'm getting that fixed this week <!-- s;) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\"" alt=\"";)\"" title=\""Wink\"" /><!-- s;) -->  We continued on to the boston basin gate, much more carefully.\
\
we shoved our snowshoes into our packs and marched the first few miles of road.  at first we were disgusted that a little snow was keeping the road closed, until we came across the washout that was really closing the road.  we continued on, and finally reached the parking lot at noon-ish.  \
\
the ranger's note at marblemount mentioned that the first half of may, the road would be gated at eldorado for repairs and such - be sure to call REI or another FS office to get the latest update before heading out there.\
\
from the parking lot you could see where the trail should follow the contour across the mtn side and into cascade pass...but there was a large/steep avalanche slope right in the middle.  looks like we wouldn't be going as far we had planned.  but we decided to head and take a look, as we were there anyway.\
\
we proceeded into the forest and acquired the trail, following its switchbacks up through the forest.  as the day warmed up, we started hearing frequent avalanches coming from cascade peak and johannesberg mtn.  this, combined with the 'moderate' forecast, and wet, heavy snowpack that showed lots of slide evidence in the open deterred us from any attempts to cross the upcoming avalanche slope - getting closer to look at it wouldn't improve the conditions that day.\
\
after some styling tele-snowshoeing through the woods in some primo cascade cement, we headed back to the car and drove back to hwy 2 at 15mph, and then to sedro-wooley at 45mph...remember the spare tire...we  arrived at sedro-wooley and found a les schwab that went above and beyond the call of duty - they had been closed for 2hrs when we arrived, but the fellow working in back on his own car opened the garage, sold us 2 tires, and installed them!  we were then able to proceed home much faster (after stopping for tacos and ice cream).\
\
did you know there's a krispy kreme in sedro-wooley???\
\
we got home at 10pm, a full day of mis-adventure.  perhaps we should have gone to colchuck peak as it appears everyone else did.\
\
(the new tires are nice 70k mile quality....but my truck only has 80k miles on it....I think the truck will die before the new tires do)"
"leavenworth-area-climbs","Leavenworth","Ralph, Eric, and I left Seattle around 8:30 to head to Lworth.  We made it\
there in record time and drove 2.5 miles up 8-mile road to bivy.  We got\
up at around 2:30 and got moving soon after...  Two-thirds the way up to\
the lake I was feeling like complete shit.  I wasn't going at the pace I\
should be going, my legs were being all klutzy, and my shoulders weren't\
getting along with my pack.  Knowing that the weather was supposed to be\
clear and sunny with highs in the 60s and thinking that I'd slow them down\
even more in the couloir, I decided that I wouldn't subject them to bad\
snow and rockfall... I dumped the gear I was carrying to Ralph and Eric\
and told them to go ahead without me.  I made it up to the lake after them\
and hung around for a few hours, mostly pacing back and forth and cursing\
the fact that I'm exhausted from working too hard and my advisor doesn't\
understand that I'm only human (and 11 PM last night he gave us several \
more hours work to do... didn't get to bed until 6 AM... Grrrrrrr!!!).  \
Ralph and Eric summited Colchuck via some other gully on the northwest side... \
oops... they can tell you more.\
\
The next day I was with the Mounties at Lworth for Rock 2.  We did the\
Tree Route at 8-Mile Buttress, topping out by noon.  Beautiful weather, and the\
North Ridge of Stuart was breathtaking.  My partner was an\
older Mountie who Ralph and I had bumped into before... Ralph referred to\
him as Pretty Boy who had a foul mouth.  Turns out his first name is Hadi\

"colchuck-peak","colchuck North butt TR","me and Aaron decided to head to leavenworth for a 3rd try on Colchuck via the North butt. The first two previous times we tried one day trips only to be exhausted and discouraged by the extra mileage of the closed road. This time the road was open and we were able to muscle our car through the snow. the coluier was in good shape with occasional patches of ice. We made our way around the NW face of colchuck(there seemed to be alot of exposure on the NW face) and climbed what seemed like 50-60 degree snow. hard to tell since my judgement sucks. having an extra tool made the climb easier and more enjoyable. After milling around we finally scrambled a final rock outcrop to the summit. all and all it was a fun trip, I dont plan on going back to colchuck again for awhile, alas it is 5:30am and im going to bed. To bad Jim an Jen couldnt make it.. We did see a climbing party from WSU climbing club doing the glacier route... =).\

"mcclellan-butte","first ascent* of McClellan Butte","*first ascent of the year, we thought, based on the utter lack of foot prints anywhere near the top.\
\
Ryan wanted to go to yoga Sunday night, so we picked out the nearby and not-too-long hike to the summit of McClellan Butte.  Neither he nor I had climbed the peak but that didn't stop us.  We hiked up, then followed some existing footprints in the snow.  As we neared the east face, it wasn't clear whether the footprints went up or turned left, and we chose up.  And we kept going up.  Up the 5th class east face, snowy in places (yay for ice axes), wet and mossy where there was rock (yay for good balance and luck).  Only a couple hundred feet up I commented \""hey, it'd be pretty bad to fall\"".  Ryan turned and looked.  We both realized we were pretty committed to heading up, as attempting to down climb was probably more dangerous.  Too bad we didn't bring a rope.  Even if we had, there weren't many good places to place pro.  Alas -- we didn't have a rope.  The little snow chutes were particularily freaky.  The slab of snow wasn't too thick, so had water seeped under and lubricated the snow enough to slide, we would have been shot straight out onto steep stuff.  Up the 70 degree snow we went (I'm pretty sure I'm not exaggerating here).  Up the wet mossy rock.\
\
The summit view was pretty.  Lunch was good.\
\
We came down the west side; much easier.  Much joyful butt-sliding.  Ryan rolled a snowball down the hillside.  It gathered sticky snow as it went and became a huge (8ft? diameter) disk rolling down the hillside before setting off a minor avalanche.  We followed.  (Other than the above-mentioned snow chutes on the way up, this was the only place where avalanche danger was at all a concert, and the avalance wasn't very big nor deep.)\
\
Some fellow we ran into on a road down below showed us his guidebook which implied that the actual trail goes below the east face and heads up quite a bit further south than our ascent route.  Oops.\
\
Some other kids we ran into were shooting skeets.  They offered not to shoot us and even to avoid shooting in the direction we were walking.  We hoped no one was hiking down below, where their broken skeets and bullet shells would be falling.\
\
I found a quarter on the trail.  I guess it was my lucky day."
"dragontail-peak","Dragontail - Triple Couloirs","Enjoyed a (mostly) beautiful day on Saturday May 3rd on triple couloirs on dragontail peak. My first trip into the Colchuck lake area... really a gorgeous spot and a nice climb.\
\
Ben Lockard and I left Seattle on friday around noon and after several attempts managed to force my truck through the snow to the mountaineer creek trailhead (a fine redneck moment of sucess). Being late in the day and warm, the snow was very soft on the approach, but we eventually made it to the lake and made camp around 5:30. A beautiful evening by the lake, watching endless spindrift rip down our route, apparently being fed by the stiff south wind blowing on the other side. \
\
We left our tent by the lake around 5am and reached the base of the route in about 35 minutes. At 5:45 we started up the first couloir, mostly 45-50 degree snow, which was quite hard in the early morning cold. We rope up for two long pitches between the first and second couloirs, the so-called \""ice runnels\"". We found only one ice runnel pitch, but found enough snow plastered to the rock to make the other pitch quite bearable, even if a \""bit runout\"". There were good belay anchors, although one of them unfortunately resulted in the belayer (sorry Ben) being pummeled constantly by the never-ending spindrift. \
\
The rest of the route consisted of less consolidated snow in the 50 degree range. Some threatening weather motivated us to go faster than our bodies really wanted us to, which made this last section a bit of a bear (read:we are way out of shape). Triple couloirs is very aesthetic in that the third couloir deposits you on the ridge only about 100 meters from the summit, making for an extremely direct line of accent. We summited at 10am, marveled at the ugliness swirling around Mt. Stuart and went down. A little more than an hour of easy hiking and sliding had us back at our camp. \
\
All in all, a very nice route. I honestly expected the climbing to be more technically challenging, and the route longer. Nonetheless, it was a very enjoyable route, and should be on everyone’s hit list. Could easily go car to car in a day, but hell, its an awesome spot to camp so why not."
,"Baring Mountain","After some negotiation regarding when it gets light out and the clearance of an \""antique Honda Civic,\"" Kevin Steffa, Jule Gust, and I got up Sunday morning and met in the Safeway parking lot on Brooklyn for an ascent of Baring Mountain.   After stopping in Sultan, I believe, for some sweet pastry breakfast, we reached the FS road off US 2 near the aptly-named town of Baring and put Kevin's Subaru to the test on the broken-up road.  There were two iffy spots, about half the road had washed out in one twenty foot section, and there was a nice ten-foot wide stream running across the road in another, not too bad but it's a good thing we didn't bring Jule's car.  \
\
We left the trailhead up an old logging road wary of trip reports we'd read, the map, and the Beckey route description.  After a hundred yards or so a creek runs across the path and the route pretty much follows it up into the forest and on to the top of the ridge.  It was raining lightly and we carefully made our way up the wet, muddy creek bed and subsequent climber's trail making it's way through the forest.  Reached the ridge in good time and followed it through increasing amounts of snow to a basin at the base of the gully we were to follow.  Ascended through low visibility and much snow to the gully and on up the slopes to the summit.  Many thanks to Jule and Kevin for braking trail in the basin with their snowshoes while I followed in my boots.  We made, as far as the summit register is concerned, the first ascent of the year and beat feet back down the mountain with some glissading in the soft snow.  Very steep descent on the mud and creek bed with some good handholds provided by the submissive local vegetation, and some boot washing at the base of the stream led us back to the trailhead.  A great scramble with good snow conditions that would probably only get tougher with less snow.   Probably even better if the sun was ever visible, something we sadly missed but had a great time without anyway."
"mount-si","Mt. Si Night Hike","Friday evening, a group (Charles, Josh, Haychoi, Doug, Aaron, and myself) of folks headed out to do a mellow night hike of Si.\
\
Since this is Si, there weren't any big surprises.  Left the car at 7:30.  Reached the summit around 10:00.  Back to the cars around midnight.  No snow on or around the trail anymore.  Good view of the lights in the valley before the clouds started to roll in around the summit.  First time for most of us trying to down-climb a gully at night.\
\
Despite some interest in a late dinner stop at the North Bend Denny's, we decided to call it a night and head back to Seattle.  Good time had by all.  Even the guy who lost the trail for a bit and wandered up into the woods.\

"mount-rainier","Camp Muir","I went to Mount Rainier with the intention of whipping my dad into shape for the summer climbing season on Saturday and was greeted with intensely sunny skies above 5000 ft.  I put sunscreen on three different times but the sweat kept taking it away so I ended up still getting burned. <!-- s:( --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_sad.gif\"" alt=\"":(\"" title=\""Sad\"" /><!-- s:( -->  We had all our glacier gear to add some weight and realism to the planned day hike up to Camp Muir so we got in line on the pack train and started trudging up.  RMI was in full swing and had several groups going up in classic fashion with all the rented gear they could carry.    Heard from a few groups coming down who had summited with beautiful weather on Friday and Saturday, sounded awesome.  At about 8500 ft, about 1:30, the dark clouds we'd seen swirling over the tatoosh rolled over the south side of the mountain and sent down it's wrathful hail.  We kept ascending and the hail turned to snow and then the thunder and lightning started.  We had heard everyone in the path's ice axes and pickets buzzing, including our own, but it wasn't until my hair stood up that I grew worried.  Lightning cracked very close to us three times, judging by the two seconds between the flash and the thunder, and it scared the hell out of me.  So my dad and I ended up turning around at about 9100 feet with a group of european climbers and headed back down.  The storm eventually moved west, taking it's death bolts with it.  Saw some deer and elk on the way out, along with great views of the mountian to round out a day where my dad and I got in a good conditioner in to prepare for the real climbs."
"mount-stuart","Stuart Glacier Couloir","I climbed the Stuart Glacier Couloir with Dalius Gylvidis and Josh Kaplan over the weekend. \
\
It's not really \""in\"" yet - there is a lot of snow in the couloir (we didn't rope up until on the ridge) and the ridge is plastered with rime ice and snow mushrooms (we had to aid some stuff, excavate for hours, got off route, prusiked up a rope at one point, all kinds of shenanigans). \
\
But, once the ridge melts out the route will be awesome! Everything else went very fast and was excellent fun. \
\
The top of the Ice Cliff Glacier Couloir looked scary. The very end is vertical snow, with a substantial crack through the top about a yard back from the lip. Needs to shake off a lot of stuff before I'll get anywhere near it. \
\
PM me if you want more details."

We took our time getting to a fabulous camp on a big flat boulder on the south side of the lake.  Sunday morning we awoke to cloudy but not unfriendly skies and quickly booted up the glacier with tiny hip packs.  It was a bit windy and cool on the summit, with Stuart briefly visible between clouds.  The snow was nicely soft on the way down, perfect for glissading.\

,"Chair Peak Circumnavigation, 5/24","Early Saturday morning, Jim and I set out to ski Kaleteen.  We were still able to put on our skis at the trailhead and made it up easily to the first pass in 2 hrs, 20 minutes.  The ski down to the lakes was great, fast boot deep corn.  From there we noticed that Kaleteen was melting out by the summit and we realized that we wouldnt be able to ski near the top.  We saw 3 gullies to take to reach kaleteen.  The last one had some navigation issues, the second to last one had a huge cornice, so we opted for the first one.  Some steep exposed skinning and then finally giving way to booting lead us to the ridge.  From there we saw our traverse to the peak, however the Cascades had something else in mind.  A storm quickly moved in, therefore we decided to ski down that gulley and get the hell out of there.  We skiinned up quickly to the pass above Chair Peak Lake in very high winds.  The weather got worse as it turned into a white out along with some rain.  From the pass, it looked like snow lake was melted out.  We still went down all the way to the lake to see how bad it was.  We were able to ski on the lake, while closely hugging the left shore line.  I aquired so much crap on my skiis, that I was able to skin up to the ridge above snow lake without skins.  It stopped raining and was back to the car very quickly after that. \
 \
I only noticed one slide which came off the rock above source lake.  \

"prusik-peak","Prusik Peak and assorted adventures (5/23-25)","Gary, Sunny and I set out on Friday to spend a few productive climbing days in the Enchantments. Packs were heavy, snow was rotten, sun was hot, so instead of pushing up Asgard Pass on Friday as planned, we spent the first night at Colchuck Lake. It was nice, but wicked little critters ate my Organic Fruit&Nut Medley. \
We were hoping that the snow would be frozen in the morning to make the ascent of Asgard pass easier, but it didn't freeze, and it was a pain. We saw two guys starting up Triple Couloirs, and shortly after the guys we saw a bunch of avalanches barreling down the gully systems on Dragontail. A few minutes later, an avalanche waltzed over our tracks. On Sunday we found out that the two guys ended up bailing from Triple Couloirs. Looks like the warm weather is putting an end to that ice-climbing silliness. \
The upper Enchantments basin was looking very alpine and grandiose with all the snow, and we plopped our camp right in the middle. Nobody else was there. \
After setting up camp, we carried on toward our objective for the day, Prusik Peak. We did the climb in leisurely style, leaving camp at 10:30am and returning at 9pm, with about 4 hours spent on the rock. The W ridge of Pruski (cool typo!) has got to be one of my favoritest climbs - extraordinarily aesthetic and cool! Gary should be posting some pictures soon. Sunny led the first pitch, I led the second and third, and Gary the final one. The infamous 5.7 unprotected slab turned out to be rather non-scary, while the climbing higher up provided some interest when Gary almost got pulled off the 5.6 lieback from terrible rope drag. There was only little snow left on the route, mostly on the ledges just beneath the summit.\
We spent little time on the summit because big mean clouds were gathering around us.  Sunny rapped down first, and pulled an interesting stunt by slinging herself off the end of the ropes onto a big rock horn. Fortunately, the horn turned out to be a perfect anchor for our second double rope rappel. Unlike some other individuals, we had chosen to bring our boots and ice axes on the climb. That was a very good thing, because the traverse under the N face back to Prusik Pass consisted of steep unstable slush. \
Back in camp, we assessed our motivation for doing more stuff the next day. The motivation was not very big, mainly because I was still fighting my residual <!-- s:evil: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_evil.gif\"" alt=\"":evil:\"" title=\""Evil or Very Mad\"" /><!-- s:evil: --> SARS <!-- s:twisted: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_twisted.gif\"" alt=\"":twisted:\"" title=\""Twisted Evil\"" /><!-- s:twisted: -->, which made me wheeze and feel exhausted. Plus the views on Sunday didn't turn out to be up to our gourmet standards, so we decided to go home. I raked in some phat turns down Asgard Pass, and felt kind of mean because Sunny and Gary were struggling on snowshoes in the glop. Sunny got so frustrated that she started dragging her pack behind her. The pack of course got away, and started hurtling down the pass by itself, strewing stuff everywhere and almost taking out Gary. I hope somebody down there got to appreciate the slapstick humor of the scene. \
Ralph and Betsy, we saw your tent and your car, so we figured you must have been up to something. Good to hear you guys had a good time too!"
,"Exit 32","Two weeks ago on a Tuesday, Eric, Ben, and I went to Exit 32 for some cragging.\

We had some route-finding problems leaving Seattle, but we figured things out and were soon buying food at the Sultan Bakery.  We rolled into the parking lot as the only car!  Not only that, but we found the rock to be dry, despite encountering light rain in the drive up.  We went up Libra/Pisces and then rappeled to the start of Breakfast of Champions, where Mike convinced me to try the lead.  I had a short fall halfway up, and hanging there a little while, sent the rest of it.  Whew, my adrenaline was totally pumping!\
I then belayed him as he TRed a hard finger crack to the right.  \
\
After lunch, we went to Thin Fingers.  I led up the approach pitch but got stopped by the funky stemming/fingers in the final twelve feet.  I lowered off two pieces and Mike then led the pitch.  When I followed up, I noticed that I had used a finger jam where before I had instead placed pro...  Then Mike sent the actual pitch.  It was raining by then, but luckily, we were on overhanging stuff.  I flailed around on TR but got too burned out on the stemming and liebacking to be able to smoothly transition to the jamming.  \

"mount-saint-helens","TR: Mount St. Helens, Memorial day","In the four years that I've lived in Seattle somehow I had never managed to visit Mount St. Helens.  So this past weekend Andreas, a friend of mine from Germany, and I headed down to Helens to climb it (or whatever is left of it).  I had tracked the weather report for the long weekend and it didn't look that good; except that it kept saying the area would be \""in between systems\"" on Monday.  So that's what we were aiming for.\
\
We drove down on Sunday afternoon.  I was worried about the permit situation because of the holiday and even more so when we say a big charter bus parked at Jack's restaurant.  It turned out, however, that they had reserved permits in advance and wouldn't count towards the 50 they give out at 6pm every day for the next day.  To kill the time until 6pm we checked out Ape Cave (dark) and Lava Canyon (deep) and went back to Jack's where only about 20 people had shown up---no need for a lottery. We bought our permits ($15 each) and headed to climbers bivy to pitch our  tent on snow.\
\
We got up at 4 Monday morning and were on our way by 4.30.  The snow was fairly consolidated and walking was easy.  At some point we put on crampons.  The \""climb\"" was then more of a stair ascend with \""pre-manufactured\"" stairs most of the way up.  Reached the crater rim by 8.45.  The look down in the crater on the lava dome is pretty impressive.  The weather was fairly good, clouds moved in and out frequently revealing Hood, Adams, Rainier (stuck in a lenticular cloud).  We had a good time on the summit watching the show.  Met three other parties there.  When we went down at 10.15 the snow had gotten pretty soft.  Good for us, so we could comfortably glissade the whole way down but bad for the 4-5 parties we met that where coming up and had a pretty tough time postholing (except one party on skies).  Arrived at the car two hours later and went back to Jack's to sign out and eat something.\
\
Since it was still early in the day we decided to check out Helens' north side.  So we drove to Johnston Ridge Observatory (it's close to a 3 hour drive) were we watched a cool movie and even learned something interesting about volcanoes making this a cool day of \""climbing\"" with an educational twist."

\
Rediculously Long Version: On Saturday, Gene, Ryan, and myself met Jeremy Holleman and his friend Mark at Royal Columns in the Tieton River Canyon to do a couple of days of eastside cragging.  Due to a bridge washout, there were three possible ways to access the crag: the ~2 mile walk around, ford the river, or use a tyrolean traverse.  Being the sensible men they were, Jeremy and Mark opted for the first option.  My party, on the other hand, was entirely too lazy and decided to go for the second option.  The river did not look bad and a suitable location for crossing was found ¼ mile downstream.  Ryan and I made it across without incident, but Gene was wearing flip-flops in order to keep his new shoes dry.  When nearly there he slipped and one of his flip-flops came off and went downstream.  The other one managed to wrap itself around his big toe and required my assistance to remove.\

The area also has a good number of low to mid difficulty cracks to climb.  The area was mostly free of crowds, especially on the 5.8+ range.  There were a number of groups (ours included), both days, that kind of played musical chairs on a few 5.7 and easier cracks.  On the trip back across the river, it was quickly noted that the river had risen since the morning.  The discovery came about something like this after stepping into the very cold water: (internal monologue) “holy crap, my nuts didn’t get wet last time, I would have remembered this!”\
\
That night we all went out for Mexican food in Yakima.  We had checked out the options in Naches first, but when forced to choose between a diner full of old people dancing to a live polka band and a biker bar, we decided to move on.  As it turns out, that night we ended up sleeping in the same small field near the tieton river as most of the people from the crag.  Gene and I started out in the same tent, but after my futile attempts to ignore his \
snoring, I ended up switching to Jeremy’s tent.  I had lived with gene in a tent for three months during the summer of 2000 without incident, but since then his snoring has reached spectacular levels.\
\
The next morning we did breakfast in Naches at the Drift Inn.  It was good, but if you come here, be prepared to tie one on, the meals are HUGE.  I have a sarong that I like to wear on climbing trips.  Not only is it the most comfortable piece of clothing that I wear, it is very versatile and makes changing in public easy.  However, the town of Naches is not necessarily the best place to wear such an item.  The trip to the bathroom, located all the way across the diner, was fraught with some of the most incredulous looks I have ever been on the receiving end of.\
\
This time around we decided to go for the tyrolean traverse, since the river was up even farther and just because it looked fun.  This was certainly not the easiest or fastest rout, as Jeremy and Mark beat us to the crag.  As soon as we crossed, Mark luckily noticed that we were parked in a no parking zone, calling to us from the crag, so Ryan had to go back over the traverse to move it.\

\
The first climb of the day was a tough 5.6, if you stemmed through the crux.  Jeremy and Mark had climbed it yesterday and recommended it.  My brother, however, was too focused on the immediate crack to notice the stemming possibilities.  Up and down he went, humming and hawing.  Finally he went for it and ended up taking his first lead fall on gear, a #1 DMM.  It was about a10 footer.  After regaining his composure he made about 20 more feet of progress before he realized he had not brought enough gear to adequately protect the climb.  The three of us have our separate racks that together make up one mondo rack, but we all like to use as little of the others gear as possible.  Ryan apparently had an overinflated opinion of his own racks capabilities, and was forced to  set an anchor and rappdown.  \

"the-tooth","The Tooth +party of 6 Mounties!","Being realitively new to Seattle, I had never climbed the tooth.  So, what the hell.  On Saturday steph (my wife) and I had a leasurely late start from alpental and followed the remaining winter ski tracks up to the split off from source lake.  there was still enough snow to make the trip fairly easy, despit the hip deep post-hole I fell into followed by complete submersion of my foot.  Brrrrr.  After the split, plenty of snow to kick steps up to the tooth in the soft slushy snow a making it quite slow.  Snowshoes would have helped a bunch.  But, we did had sun!  We get to the base and start up the 3rd class choss to the base.  I hear \""rock!\"" and see a football size chunk wizz a foot from my head.  The rock had been sent down by some totally-stupid-gumby-mountie lady standing on a small ledge at the base of the first pitch.  After yelling a choice amount of expletives, she replied \""this is loose\"".  No sh*t!  I suppose that is what I get for going to the tooth on a saturday.    The party of six is cattle trailing up the route and we have to wait at every belay for the them.  But, again we had sun and it was a fantastic day.  I even got sunburnt.  The route was mostly class 4, save for the 5.0 catwalk (steph's assessment, as she led it) and 5.3 move on the second pitch.  Had some fantastic views from the summit, could see all the way to Mt. Stuart.  Guess what, had to wait a total of 1.5 hours for the mounties to finish rapping off (complete with prussiks and rap belay on the end of the rope)  <!-- s:roll: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_rolleyes.gif\"" alt=\"":roll:\"" title=\""Rolling Eyes\"" /><!-- s:roll: --> .  Did I mention it was a beautiful day?  anyway, the route was fun and the snow made a perfect soaking wet glissade down.  Watch out for the melted out rock moats on the decent gully to the lake.  I glissaded off a 5 foot rock overhand and luckily jumped at the last minute to safety.  Back at the car by 7:30 p.m.  Were on the rock for a total of 6hours due to congestion     <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\"" alt=\"":shock:\"" title=\""Shocked\"" /><!-- s:shock: -->   But, despite all the complaining, sure beats working!  My advice, climb it during the week."
"mount-shuksan","TR:  Shuksan via Sulphide Glacier","Elain and I had Shuksan basically all to ourselves over the weekend.  Saw no other climbers on the Sulphide or on the Summit Pyramid.  Snow conditions on the pyramid were less than optimal, definitely more sketchy than expected.  We got off-route (veered to the right of the \""central gully\"") due to the limited visibility.  Thrashed about in sketchy (for us) mixed terrain, backed off, tried again, and finally gave up at 9000'.  Snow conditions above 8900' were pretty unpleasant, very unconsolidated and sugary.  Would be fun to try again after a little more consolidation has taken place, maybe by a different route than the Sulphide.  Should have brought some rock pro also.  Very cloudy on the descent - GPS helped.\
\
Encountered one party on the hike out, that had apparently camped at 5400' or so, and bailed on their summit attempt due to the heavy cloud cover."
"kyes-peak","Kyes Peak (June 1)","After getting all hyped up to climb Liberty Ridge this weekend, but getting (again!) thwarted by the weather, I felt antsy and had to get it out of my system and go climb some other ridge, which turned out to be the S ridge of Kyes Peak. Fortunately Gary came along, to saved me from soloing in a very lonely place. \
Kyes is one of the peaks of the very cool Monte Cristo group, and at 7227 (or so) the highest. It can be approached from several different directions, including the Upper Pride Glacier which is rumored to be a good ice climb. We took the S ridge, to which you get from the Blanca Lake trailhead. We got to the trailhead Saturday night, walked up to the saddle where you join the ridge and where lovely little Virgin Lake is located, and camped there. It drizzled a bit overnight, and we woke up to profuse cloudiness. Fortunately the ridge is foolproof to follow, because if you don't you fall down many hundred feet on either side. We knew it was a long climb (16 miles round trip), but were still surprised by how long it was! The ridge stretches for about five miles, and most of it was climbing over rolling cornices at the ridgetop, with the occasional interspersed rock outcroppings and cascadesy tree acrobatics. We couldn't see a dang thing most of the way to the summit, but it turns out you don't really see the summit anyway until you get to the false summit, which we reached via a short steep snow finger after a long slush traverse. Once on the summit, the cloud ceiling started lifting slowly, and revealing snippets of awe-inspiring scenery, lofty cragginess and tumbling ice and water. As usual, Gary will be posting the fine shots taken with his new, darling digital camera. \
Except for a guy who climbed the peak from Monte Cristo in January (wow), we were the first ones up there this year. On the way back, we followed our footsteps, up and down every bump on the ridge, not wanting any epics caused by clever detours. \
A very aesthetic, athletic scramble!"
,"Prime Rib","hm ok my first post, it seemed more fun than brushing up on titration chemistry, Hopefully I put it in the right spot on the forum!  

I climbed Prime Rib with my friend/ climbing partner, Seth, this past Friday, July 3rd.  Temperatures were slated to be 91 deg that day but we were both looking for a long climb and I wanted to work on endurance and rope management.  We started early-ish, around 7am, in hopes of beating the heat, and did a pretty good job of it.  With the first 6 or so pitches in the shade and a light breeze it was quite a nice temp for a long climb.  We swapped leads for the entirety of the trip and moved pretty steadily up the majority of the climb.  But by about the 7th pitch were were in full sun and our feet started to feel the duration of the climb more than anything.  The huge ledge between the 6th and 7th pitch didn't help when we got off track and traversed right instead of left to the base of pitch 7 in our rock shoes, such shoes were not made for walking!!!  The plentiful and large belay ledges did not promote the most tidy of rope management, though we would have been better off keeping things more tidy with the traverses!  But overall the whole lead swap was a fairly kempt process.  The final pitch, the 5.9, was definitely more challenging with the dry 91 deg day reaching its peak and our toes rather unhappy.  Regardless all 11 pitches were completed.  For the long rap process down we teamed up with the only other team committed to topping out, and AMI guide and her charge.  This made the process faster, as Seth or I lead the rap and ferried the next rope down to have it setup and ready to go for the 4 of us.  She was a master of rope coiling and I believe we learned a technique or two about getting a lot of people down a rap line in a minimum amount of time.  All in all a great trip, bring my max length 3p and seth's 5p climbing up to 11p.  

For those interested, i'd say its a very doable climb for strong beginners/intermediates comfortable with leading, none of the leads are too difficult, with the last being the crux, but no shame in topping out at pitch 10!  Also watch where you place long draws vs. short, a lot of long pitches with major rope drag potential!

Me and Aaron climbed Glacier Peak Via Frost bridge. The weather was great, and there were no people on the moutain. We left Saturday night and hiked to Kennedy Hot Springs to take a nap. Sunday we hiked below Kennedy Peak and established our base camp.  The weather was perfect. Overnight temps must have been in the 40s and when we woke up in the morning there were low clouds in the valley and clear skies above 7,000 feet. We left camp around 3 am and climbed up over the rabbit ears and down the other side. The last ridge to the summit was semi steep(Maybe 50-55 degrees?) Hard to tell. The summit views were great. Lucky for us, we decided to carry over all our gear and descend the Stikum Glacier. We glissaded down most of the glacier and had a brutal hike back to the car. It was a great climb, and I would like to go back and try the Simitar(sp) route."
,"Simitar route","Aaron correct me if im wrong, but I belive the Simitar route is to the left of sitkum spire. it is the most difficult routes on glacier peak i belive. Grade 4??  Whoever found my beans and rice will have a free meal for themselves =)... I was worried when Aarons Crampon broke because i had to kick steps for his butt the whole way to the top. =).... As far as snow conditions, they were not horrible it was fairly warm the night before and the last section of climbing to the summit was fairly easy to kick steps in. I'm soooooooooooo glad we carried over our stuff, because it would be a pain in the ass downclimbing the same route.. =)"
"three-o-clock-rock","Sticky Shoes Samba, 3 O'Clock Rock","Ryan and I went to 3 O'Clock Rock on Monday, and it was quite a lovely and productive day with 15 pitches of very fine and well-protected rock climbed.  \
None of us had climbed Darrington rock before, perhaps because of a reputation of obscurity and hardtofindness. The road was a bit rough with cow-sized potholes, but the little Honda made it just fine. If one were to continue to the Green Giant trail though, more clearance would be nice. The trailhead is at 6.1 miles up forest road 6070(?), and the trail is super nice and took us to the N buttress of the rock in half an hour. We saw huge cedar trees, and stumps <!-- s:( --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_sad.gif\"" alt=\"":(\"" title=\""Sad\"" /><!-- s:( --> thereof.  \
We climbed: \
Silent Running (5.10b, 7 pitches) \
It's called that name because when you fall off on lead you run downhill until the rope catches you. 5.10 on slabs is a very different experience from 5.10 in other places, and provided good excitement. Ryan kept his nerves together admirably on the last pitch (the optional 5.10b finish to the route), where you get to step up three foot steps onto slopy ledges, and a lot of faith in sticky shoes is required.\
\
Total Soul (first 4 pitches, 5.9)\
The third and fourth pitch are delicious. This one follows a thin quartz dike, and is a bit more run out than Silent Running, but never more than 20 feet between bolts or gear placements. The stuff after the fourth pitch looked complicated, so we didn't even try. \
\
Broad Daylight (first two pitches, 5.<!-- s8) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cool.gif\"" alt=\""8)\"" title=\""Cool\"" /><!-- s8) -->\
Very short pitches, the second one involves going up some big steps and bolts are about 3 feet apart. Nice. \
\
Under the Bored Walk (fun 5.7 knobs plus trying a totally wicked 5.11 move over the Great Arch that took so much sweat out of Ryan that we rated it equivalent to a 160 foot pitch)\
\
All the routes are equipped with lovely belay and rap anchors, so you can bail anytime. Double rope rappels are required to get down, walking off would be not fun. \

"mount-shuksan","Sulphide Glacier of Mt. Shuksan","Jeff and I left Seattle at 7:30 Saturday morning and arrived at the Shannon Creek Trailhead around 10:30.  We headed down the trail in a light drizzle, which quickly let up, leaving us with cloudy skies.  An hour and a half later we were on the tree covered ridge leading towards the toe of the Sulphide Glacier.  As the trees thinned we stopped so Jeff could put on skies to skin up to the glacier.  From there we ascended snow slopes to set up camp at ~6500 ft.  By the time we set up camp, there was another group of 2; a group of 3, 4, and 9.  We decided on a 4 AM rise time in hopes that we could avoid a traffic jam on the summit pyramid.  As the afternoon progressed we watched the summit of Baker and Shuksan go in and out of the clouds.\
\
We peeked outside at 4 AM and could barely see 50 ft.  The conditions were ugly so we waited a half hour.  By 4:30 the skies still hadn't improved so we decided to follow yesterday's boot track to the summit pyramid and see what happened.  By 8:05 AM we were sitting at the end of the boot track with the summit pyramid nowhere in sight.  Maybe twenty minutes later the clouds blew through briefly giving us a view of the pyramid right in front of us.  Just as quickly it was covered again.  Ten minutes later we got another view of the lower part of the pyramid and decided to go for it.  We could see a line starting in a runnel, up the gully.  We stayed in the runnel for a hundred feet or so before climbing out to find easier climbing.  The snow was hard and good for front pointing.  I was also grateful to have an ice tool in addition to my ice ax.  By the time we were half way up the clouds had cleared, and we were above the sea of clouds with only Baker jutting out like a lone island.  We reached the summit in an hour and fifteen minutes, where we were treated to a beautiful view of Baker.  After spending time snapping photos, eating and drinking, we down climbed the same gully we came up (took another hour).  The downclimb wasn&#8217;t too difficult after the first 25 ft. (here it was difficult to see where we were kicking steps).   By this time the sun had hit the gully making kicking deeper steps a little easier.  The downside was the ice was starting to fall from above as we downclimbed.  When we reached the base of the pyramid the group of 3 had started up and the group of nine was debating route selection.  It was great to be the first ones that day to summit.  I can't imagine being on that route on a more crowded day.  \
\
Jeff skied down to camp, while I plunge stepped and glissaded the last big slope.  We packed up camp (left 1 PM) and descended back down to the car  (arrived 3:25 PM).  We arrived back in Seattle by 6:30 PM.  All in all a great trip and my first big summit in the Cascades.  \
\
Photos to come once they are developed."
,"snow line","Matt,\
\
Thanks.\
\
There was intermittent snow on the Phelps Creek trail after the second mile or so, and a fair bit of uniform snow coverage during the last mile before you get to Leroy Creek.  Once we crossed Leroy Creek, we didn't see much snow on the steep climber's trail until we hit 5000' or so.  Above 5000' or so, there was quite a bit of snow, but still occasional patches of dirt.  Once we hit 6000' or so, it was snow everywhere.  By picking the right snow ramp to get through the one steep section between 6700-7000', it should be possible to ski from the Col (8150') to the basin at 6200', and to continue on a ways down from there, to Leroy Creek.\
\
Hope that helps.\

"index","Index LTW/GNS","Eric and I went to Index for the morning and found things surprisingly dry.  Unfortunately, I wasn't feeling 100%, so I wasn't going to let Eric con me into leading Godzilla (I'll lead it some time this summer!).  I led up Lizard, where I proceeded to put Eric through follower hell.  (Well, it could have been worse... I led the bottom fist crack with my pack, and I could have had him take it.)  First, I left a super-bomber nut in the thin corner for Eric to clean.  Then, I wimped out halfway up the awkward flaring chimney and offered Eric to experience the joy on lead.  He topped out on the chimney and set a belay, and I led the super cool exposed undercling/lieback.  When Eric followed up that pitch,  we had the strangest thing happen.  \
\
I had protected the start of the lieback, and then after clearing the roof, I placed a 1.75 Friend (.75 Camalot) and put a shoulder-length sling on it.  Somehow when Eric was following up, the rope drooped down into the crack and got wedged/camed behind the cam!  It was totally stuck!  Eric and I then had a little miscommunication on how to fix things.  I wanted him to anchor in, and I'd rap down, unstick the rope, and self-belay back up.  He misheard things and put a prusik on the rope to belay himself.  By the time I had tied him off and started to rap, he had just cleared the roof.  I guess if I would have placed the piece a few feet higher, the rope wouldn't have drooped down.\
\
We quickly got things straightened out, and then Eric got to my final piece... a tricam.  He was like, \""I'm going to place every tricam on your rack on my next lead!\"" <!-- s:) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\"" alt=\"":)\"" title=\""Smile\"" /><!-- s:) -->  We then rapped down and climbed Scimtar Crack and Pisces.  After that we top-roped Libra.\
\
All in all, a good morning... the rope getting stuck certainly spiced things up a bit.  Eric dropped me off at Jim's shop on the way back, and Jim popped some WD-40 on my gummy cam.  Jim rules!"
"mount-daniel","Mt. Daniel","This weekend I went to climb Mt. Daniel with the Mounties (Sunny was the other ropelead).\
It rained/snowed on us on Saturday, and on Sunday morning, it was still snowing, and we had consistently high winds.  The not-so-nice conditions (six inches of freshiez but snow seemed stable, visibility was poor but still navigable, but the cold and the wind were pretty bad), compounded with group dynamics (one of the students had a bad stomach ache and another one was pretty slow), led us to decide near Pea Soup Lake to head back down (things would have gotten really fucked up if a student ran into trouble and we were all stuck out in the open for an extended period of time)."

From Ingalls Lake, we saw Mount Stuart and there were scary, nasty clouds swirling around it at about the 7000' level.  At the time, it looked to us like the winds might be pretty savage up there at the top of Stuart.   But then again, we heard that several parties were heading up Stuart on Sunday from the Esmeralda Basin trailhead.  Not sure how they made out.\

"mount-baker","Mt Baker N Ridge, June 25/26","Matt's photo caused Gary and me to go climb the N ridge of Baker, and it really was quite pretty. We bivied on the Coleman at 7300', and left at 2am to cross over to the base of the N ridge. The Coleman glacier is still in good shape, so that was no problem and we got to the ridge at 4am. We took the lower approach, going around the bottom of the ridge and starting up its left side. There was some fresh snow, up to knee deep in places, but mostly conditions were very nice. At the base of the ice cliff, we met up with two AAI teams, and they were kind enough to let us pass them. There are many different lines one could take to gain the ice cap, and if you're longing for hard, steep ice, there's plenty of it. We took the easiest way straight up the left arete, and even that was entertaining enough (one pitch, up to of 70 degrees). For me to lead any other line, I would have needed more ice screws, but we had brought only five, four of which were for belays.\
After that, it was all straightforward snow climbing. At 10,000', Gary started to feel unwell, but some food, drink and bluebagging restored him to full capacity again. The summit was windy so we didn't hang out very long. We got back to the car at 3pm, a 24 hour roundtrip as Gary proudly noticed, and way more comfortable than a car-to-car without any sleep. Fun times."
"ruby-mountain","Ruby Mountain","Climbed Ruby Mountain off of the North Cascades Highway on Fridqay and was treated to some hard-earned spectacular views of the North Cascades.  You really have to pay attention and work hard to not get cliffed out on the route as you work your way up the North Ridge.  Many of the major peaks of the North Cascades were visible sometime on the route, Snowfield, Baker, Shuksan, Challenger, and Triumph in particular.  There's a big antennae wiht a solar power panel and a large transformer at the summit, anybody know what that is? Ran into impassable rock bands and cliffs several times on the way down which made the descent really long and adventurous, and ended up getting me off track by about a quarter mile when I got back to the road.  Wouldn't be a problem except I couldn't figure out if I was a quarter mile east or west of where I parked and had to flag somebody down to ask if they had seen my car east or west of me.  I got the information from them and ended a long day of scrambling in great weather."
"glacier-peak","Glacier Peak, June 25-27","Charles Peach, his sister Dolly, and myself just got back from a three day trip to Glacier Peak.  Since none of us has extensive glacier expereience, we felt most comfortable ascending via the Sitkum Glacier.  We hiked in to Boulder Basin on Wednesday beneath cloudless skies, and were happy to find several campsites snow-free and the basin empty of other climbers.  \
\
We roped up at the foot of the Sitkum the next morning and headed for the summit, somewhat nervous about the clouds forming at our backs.  Made good time to Sitkum Spire, but then the clouds rolled in over us.  Fortunately, the occaisional breaks allowed us to stay on course to the summit as we scrambled up the pumice ridge (more fun coming down than going up).  Keeping right of the summit rocks, we kicked our way up a snow chute, traversed a brief, but steep, stretch of the Scimitar Glacier, and topped out in a complete white-out with howling winds.  We were just about the head down when the clouds broke, giving us a fleeting glimpse of the valley below.  After another few minutes when no further gaps developed we began our descent, returning to camp without incident.\
\
We were the only group on Glacier that day, though on the way out we passed ten teams heading up the White Chuck Trail for Boulder Basin.  Three days seems pretty ideal for the trip, rather than summiting and hiking out on the second day.  In retrospect, the Sitkum was so benign, we probably didn't need to be roped up for anything other than the traverse of the Scimitar just beneath the summit.  Long approach, but really worthwhile.  Even if you don't get a chance to see much from the peak.   <!-- s:D --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\"" alt=\"":D\"" title=\""Very Happy\"" /><!-- s:D -->  Also, my first try using strap on crampons with with my backpacking boots.

,"Darrington 7/1/03","Taking advantage of all the overtime I have accrued by working way too many weekends, my wife and I took off to Darrington yesterday for a little friction extravaganza.  Had a fantastic time on the nice grippy granite.  We got there late after sleeping in and a 2 hour drive.  Our standard sedan-ish 2-wheel drive low clearance car made it down the rocky-rutted road to the trailhead.  We climbed Silent Running for 6 pitches and rapped off before the last 10b pitch.  The weather was a little spotty and windy, at times forcing us to throw on the jackets.  Great climbing in a beautiful setting though and pretty well bolted for a friction climb.  We even found several opportunites for some weird pro placements like opposing stoppers and lowe-balls.  Bring two  ropes for the raps though.  Great place to get solid on friction.  Steph got her first 5.9 friction lead and was stoked about it."
"ingalls-peaks","Another Ingalls Peak TR","Last Wednesday, with our advisor out of town, Ania and I blew off work to climb the S Ridge on Ingalls.  The weather was beautiful, and the view from the top was very nice.  The climb can be done in two pitches with a pretty minimal rack.  Hexes seemed to work better than either stoppers or cams.   In my usual style, I carried too large a rack, but I suppose that, like sport climbing, carrying too much gear \""makes you strong for the mountains.\""  <!-- s:wink: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\"" alt=\"":wink:\"" title=\""Wink\"" /><!-- s:wink: -->   Snow was continuous from Ingalls Pass to the base of the climb, but the climb itself was completely dry.

Ahhh....so beautiful! I was getting sentimental. The North Face was in very nice condition, with firm neve that up to 50 degrees steep and took pretty trustworthy pickets for running belays. It was nice having an ice axe plus a technical tool. Bergschrunds and crevasses were there, but easy to get around. We took 8 hours from camp to summit, and another four hours back to camp traversing through Horseshoe basin. We were the first party up on Buckner this year, didn't see anybody else anywhere. It was a long day, and next time I do this I'll definitely do the carryover with camp on Boston Glacier. That way, it'd be even more cool and scenic. Pictures should follow soon."
"mount-rainier","TR:  Rainier via Emmons Glacier, 7/6","Dustin and myself climbed Rainier last Sunday via the Emmons Glacier route.  Originally we were supposed to be three people but ended up as two in the last minute.\
\
We left Seattle around 10am Saturday morning and made it to Mount Rainier NP in about 2 hours.  Due to some delay (a fallen tree had blocked the road and gotten the rangers all excited) in getting the permits (a hefty $30 for each) we didn't start hiking from White River Campground until 2.30pm.  The Glacier Basin trail is very pleasent and goes trough some old growth forest.  From Glacier Basin we ascended the Inter Glacier, passed Camp Curtis, and dropped onto the Emmons Glacier to get to Camp Schurman by 8.30pm.  Since we both hadn't been above 11000 ft before we didn't know how we would react to altitude and therefore had originally planned to take it easy, stay in Camp on Sunday in order to acclimatize and climb to the summit Monday morning.  The weather, however, was excellent with blues skies and only light winds.  And apparently everybody else in camp got ready to go for the summit that night.  After setting up the tent and melting snow we decided to get up at 3am to go for a \""little hike\"" to maybe 11.000 ft or so.  Well, we got up at 3am and were on our way on the Emmons Glacier at 4.30am.  Other parties had left for the summit much earlier, some at 11.30pm, most others at around 1am.  The party in front of us was about 90 min ahead.  Since we were so late it was already fairly bright and we didn't need to use our headlamps at all.  Being just a 2 person rope team we moved up the \""Corridor\"" quickly, gaining about 1000 ft per hour for the first 2 hours.  Since we both felt pretty good there was no reason to return to camp and not go for the summit.  When we came close to the bergschrund we ventured to the right, following a traversing trail with huge crevasses close by.  Some people passed the bergschrund without traversing but apparently the snow bridge wasn't very stable.  Therefore we continued traversing all the way to the saddle between the summit and Liberty Cap where we could pass it easily.  Here, Dustin started to have some altitude related problems but since we were so close there was not much thought of turning around now.  When we finally arrived on the crater rim at noon we had the whole summit to ourselves!  The problem was that we had nearly run out of water.  Luckily I had taken my stove along and we started melting snow.  Since Dustin didn't feel too well we decided, however, that it was better to descend quickly and aborted the melting process.  We started downclimbing at 12.45pm.  The descend was slow and uneventful, except the traverse back that was a bit exciting again.  (We had chosen to use a lower traverse for variation.)  We again run out of water but made it down to camp by 5.30pm.  Since we had scheduled the trip for three days we spent the night in camp and hiked out the following morning.\
\
This was a very pleasent and fairly easy glacier climb on a big mountain.  Lesson learned:  Take enough water along!  The 2.5 liters each that we had taken was not sufficient at all.  Some people had taken as much as 4.5 liters and had run dry anyway."
"mount-adams","Adams Glacier attempt","After some deliberation about a climbing destination, Touray and I decided to head to Mt. Adams this Thursda-Friday.  We left for high camp from the car thursday morning through strong heat and pretty intense mosquitos and followed trails up to high meadows at about 6900 ft.  We decided to camp a little higher at about 7300 on some rocks where it turned out to be almost unbearably hot in the late afternoon, probably int he mid 80's.  That night I got very little sleep and suffered from all kinds of aches and pains until about midnight when I started puking everywhere.  I threw up so hard my nose bled and at that point it became obvious no summit bid was possible.  I tried to rest up a little more before we left our camp for the car at 2:30am which allowed us glimpses of some deer, elk, and jackrabbits on thew early drive home."
"mount-adams","Adams Glacier part 2","Adams Glacier TR 2003 Part 2\
\
After much deliberation and debate me and Aaron Z decided that we should try the North Side of Adams via Adams Glacier. The adams glacier icefall looked wicked, 50 degree snow/ice slopes, and plenty of crevasses to negotiate made this a mountain worth climbing. me and Aaron Z left the lowlands around 5 am. After a rather uneventful drive across hwy 12 we reached the the north side of Mt. Adams around 9 am.  We quickly packed our gear and paid 9 dollars out of 20 dollars due for volcano passes. \
\
We made a brisk pace up the trail, only to be attacked suddenly by swarming Kamikaze mosquitos. The constant biting was enough to propel me farther up the trail at a record pace. Finally we reacehed a quaint and quiet meadow at approximately 6,000 feet. The views of the Adams ice fall and the surrounding peaks was priceless. Hands down one of the best views in the south cascades. To add topping to the pie, no one else was on the north side of the mountain(at least we thought). After escaping the killer mosquitos, we were menaced yet again by the burning sun. I had never experinced such hot weather on a cascade peak as I did on Adams. When we got to our base camp (around 7,200 feet) it felt like it was 90 degrees(I doubt it ) the sun reflecting off the glacier and surrounding snowfield amplified us in a magnifying glass. We got so hot we took off all of our clothes(leaving only our boxers  and boots on).  I'm a fairly tan guy and i got pretty burnt on my arms. Aaron(being Anglo saxon) faired much worst. \
\
We spent most of the day eating and escaping the heat, we finaly hit the sack around 6 pm. ARound 12:30 am I was awoke by the sound of Aaron puking his guts outside the tent. to make matters worst his nose was bleeding.  We contemplated our situation for awhile, and we both decided it would not be wise to make the summit with Aarons sickness. I contemplayed soloing the route, but I didnt want to make Aaron wait. Plus i was scared Sh@#$tless by the countless rock and ice fall coming off the adams Glacier. at 1:20 am we bolted down the mountain side, arriving at my car by 4:20am. \
\
IT took us 3 hours to reach the lowest of the lowlands along the way I almost killed us by falling asleep at the wheel at least 10 times. Luckily Im here typing, when I got home i took a nice long bath and it felt goooooood......All and all this was a great trip, although we didn't summit the north side of ADams is awesome and beautiful in its own right. lots of meadows and alpine forest, with no people made this trip great. It was much better then doing any dog route on Rainier any day. I hope to go back again soon.\

"three-fingers","Three Fingers, July 12","Charles Peach, Jen Gregory, and I hiked up to the Three Fingers Lookout on Saturday.  The hike is long, but one of the most scenic I've found in the Cascades.  Even the approach is nice, winding through alpine grasslands before Tin Pan Gap.  The hike up to the look-out is pretty straightforward, and could probably be done with only an ice axe, but we felt better for having crampons.  The final stretch (up three ladders) is \""interesting\"

"green-giant-buttress-darrington","Dreamer - 7/11","Marcie and I spent Friday sweating our way up Dreamer on the Green Giant Buttress out in Darrington. Beatuifal rock, and quite varied climbing makes for an excellent 9-10 pitch expeirience. Views were fantastic.\
\
Good trail all the way to the base. Cariend a set of nuts and 1 set of cams to 3.5\"". Penty of gear. All belays are bolted, making the route and decent go quickly. I think we were 6 hrs on the way up, and 1.5 to decend.\
\
A really nice route. About 4 pitches of slabby climbing, 3-4 of steeper crack climbing and a few pitches of near vertical face climbing. A little more run out in sections than the climbs down the road at Three-O'clock-Rock, but otherwise very reasonable. All 5.9 climbing was well protected.\
\
Well worth the trip.\

"dragontail-peak","Dragontail, Serpentine Arete (July 13/14)","On Sunday morning both Gary and I woke up thinking that we would go to Mt Shuksan and slosh through wet underbrush to find whiteout conditions on the N Face, then go home. But inspiration hit in the form of Dragontail, which we decided would certainly have more reliable weather. Serpentine Arete is probably the most popular 'real' rock route on it, 15 pitches long, 5.8, class IV or so they say. So we got a nice late start Sunday and hiked up to Colchuck Lake with the camping-legalizing permit proudly dangling from Gary's pack. We camped on the same boulder that Ralph and Betsy used in May, and a fine boulder it was. We got up around 3am, and started climbing the route at 5. There was another party of three starting out at the same time (they had gotten weathered off the previous day), and even though wanted us to go ahead of them, we somehow got stuck behind them and consequently spent a bit of time waiting around, coming to a total of about two hours. The climbing was awesome, fun moves, good rock, great pro, killer views. I won't recount the pitches because it would require that I use my brain, plus you can read about it in a guidebook anyway. The one thing I should mention though is that Gary chose to lead up the left side of the pillar, a stiff 5.8 layback/dihedral (normal people take the 5.8 crack system on the right side), because \""it looked like fun\"". I, on the other hand, was carrying the pack with our boots (necessary), ice axes (helpful), crampons (unnecessary) and whatever else, and bitched and grunted my way up, arriving at the top completely exasperated. Fortunately, now we had a full hour's relaxing wait for the other party to move up, which we spent eating sandwich, freezing our asses off, and shivering. We finally got into the warm sun when we gained the top of the ridge after 7 or so pitches. Yum. From there on, we simul-climbed almost everything except for several short 5th class steps, and took the easy way up the summit block by going around to the left and up the scramble route. The descent was sweet, we glissaded down the glacier to a tiny lake just before Aasgard Pass, where we celebrated the climb with tasty sandwich and cool glacier water. Then we found out why people hate Aasgard Pass (because it sucks!). It was definitely more fun when there was still snow. We packed up camp quickly because we were getting bombarded by mosquitoes, and on the trail down met this crazy dad with his six heavily laden pack children, and mildly tried to dissuade him from chasing them up Aasgard the next day. I felt like one of those rangers who always tell people that they surely will die if they venture out into the mountains. Incidentally, on the way up I met two guys with a far-away look in their eyes, and one of them said, \""hey man, just a quick sanity check, dude, are we still on the trail?\"","",""0"
"eldorado-peak","Eldorado Pk TR","My best friend and I did the standard route up Eldorado on Tuesday. We were originally planning on heading east, but the weather was so beautiful we stayed by the crest. \
\
We began at 9:30 am and thought we would be pressed for time, but we summited at 2:45 and completed the trip in no rush at just before 7 pm. \
\
Eldorado Glacier is lightly crevassed and thereafter, there are no real crevasses to negotiate. The snow conditions were soft so crampons were not needed. The summit ridge was exposed as expected, but we did not use our pickets. The knife edge is in authentic shape! Conditions were warm other than the summit crest where winds made it feel chilly. My favorite part of the view was to Forbidden Glacier. \
\
I definitely feel that Eldorado is a good objective for a day trip. The approach goes pretty fast with a daypack and the elevation gain, while massive (6,600+ ft), seems realistic in a day (10 to 12 hours). However, camping on Inspiration Glacier would be a nice experience for sunset/sunrise purposes and for the traverse to Austera Peak. \
\
Next time I am going to bring a frisbee for the flats on the Inspiration Glacier!"
"mount-shuksan","Shuksan","Robc and I found each other on CC.com after two days off greeted me Thursday and Friday and we decided to do a basic climb together in the North Cascades.  I think we were both uneasy about trying something very demanding wihtout having climbed together before so we opted for the Sulphide route on Shuksan.  On the way in up Shannon Creek road two fawns refused to leave the road just ahead of us.  I tried stopping and waiting for them to leave, driving fast to try and get aroudn them, and honking my horn to scare them, but they just ran a steady ten feet in front of us until about within a half-mile of the trailhead they found a small clearing to finally get out of the way.  Camped at the base of the Sulphide and slept soundly until about 5:00 am when the sun started to come up.  ROb and I couldn't sleep anymore so we got up and started climbing, reaching the base of the pyramid about 8:00 and after taking our time scrambling up the rocky and intermittently icy gully attained the summit at 10:30.  The best view I've ever had.  From the Coast Range to Garibaldi south to the Olympics to Rainier and all of the Cascades north of there.   Again we went slow and conservative on the way down and didn't reach the base of the pyramid until noon.  Back to the tent two hours later and after some rest in the sun and absorbing the amazing view, including a huge forest fire smoke plum to the east, got to the car a little before 5.  I blew a tire on the way out Baker Lake road so the rest of the trip I had to keep it under fifty so as to not tax the spare.  It took me about 5 hours to get home going 48 mph in the right lane all the way from the trailhead."
"mount-thomson","Thompson, W. Ridge","Marcie and I climbed the W. Ridge on Mt Thompson, which is up at Snoqualmie Pass this weekend. As Jim Nelson says in Crowded Climbs II, this was a very pleasant, easy route. The approach (7ish miles) is just long enough for the climb to feel like its in the backcountry, but it is all on very good trails. \
\
We hiked in Saturday and camped in the basin directly below the peak, although it is definately possible to do the route in a day. The camping though was very pleasant, making for a mellow 2-day trip. \
\
4 Pitches of roped climbing (up to mid 5th class) and a bit of 3rd class scrambling leads one to the summit, and a pretty easy decent of the E. ridge makes the whole climb go pretty quick. For us, three hours from camp to summit, and an hour and fifteen minutes back down. \
\
Definately a fun easy route that is close to home. \

"eldorado-peak","TR: Eldorado Peak","Jim Prager and I wanted to climb Eldorado last weekend via the Inspiration Glacier route.  We rolled into the Marblemount ranger station around 11am to get a backcountry permit but they where out of permits (Will Jim ever get a permit in Marblemount??).  Well, this being a weekend with a forecast of sunny weather this should have been no surprise.  Anyway, we decided to do the climb on Sunday as a one day climb.  After talking to the rangers about what to do with the Saturday we had the choice between a tractor show in Marblemount and a easy hike up Sauk Mountain just outside of Rockport.  Luckily, Jim insisted on the hike. The view from Sauk Mountain was pretty amazing: Baker and Shuksan close by, the Pickets, Eldorado, Boston, Sahale, Johannesburg, Glacier, Rainier, the Olympics, and the smoke from the foresfire in the east.  The hike took us 45 min up and 15 min down the mountain.  It was pretty busy, lots of families and at least half a dozen dogs.   We then pitched Jim's tent at a very nice camp site by the Cascade River Road about 500ft east of the Eldorado Creek trailhead. \
\
The next morning we started hiking up Eldorado Creek from the road at 3.45am.  Made good progress through the forest and the boulder fields.  The heather area above the boulder fields is beautiful, rivaling even Sahale Arm.  When we dropped over the ridge on the glacier clouds had moved in and the weather didn't look too good.  We pressed on, however, roped up, and went up to the large plateau on the Inspiration glacier.  The weather had now gotten worse, visibility was down to maybe 30 ft.  We went up the summit ridge to about 7600 ft hoping the weather would improve.  Since it didn't we decided the summit without the view wasn't worth the effort and we turned around.  We arrived back down at the road at about 4pm.  \
\
This was my second try to summit Eldorado, the second time the weather got bad.  Anyway, this is a great climb and the views -- from what I've heard -- are impressive.  I'll definitely try again..."
"kyes-peak","Kyes Peak TR","Did Kyes Peak in Monte Cristo area on Tuesday. Another hot one, too hot for me! Anyways, went up through the Columbia Glacier and down the South Ridge route. Started at 8 am, arrived at Blanca at 9:30, summited at 12:30, chilled out for awhile, and then descended arriving at the car at 5 pm exhausted (9 hour total trip). The sun, heat, and long EL gain wasted me!\
\
After doing both, I can say that going down to the Columbia Glacier from the summit in the \""break in the cliffs\"" seems kinda sketchy, especially if you didn't ascend that way (looks like it cliffs out from above). The gravel is very loose and there is some wet rock, ok for the ascent. \
\
The south ridge seemed straight forward. There is a climbers path that can be picked up through most of the ridge. Point 5845 can be avoided by traversing on the west side to avoid needless elevation gain. The final rock scramble to the 7227 ft summit seemed more intense than imagined, but that's the way a lota stuff goes. \

"Inspiration-peak","Southern Pickets Adventuring (July 20-22)","Eric and I went into Terror basin for three days to climb the W Ridge of Inspiration and perhaps tag McMillan Spire too. Eric had done all the research on the climb and convinced me at the last minute that we should go do it, so I bumbled along quite cluelessly.  <!-- s:oops: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_redface.gif\"" alt=\"":oops:\"" title=\""Embarassed\"" /><!-- s:oops: --> \
Now comes a bunch of detailed gibberish that you will only want to read if you're planning on going there. The approach was strenuous to be sure, but much more straightforward than we were afraid it would be. At the trailhead, we had met three guys who had just returned from Inspiration and who gave us some nice information, half of which we remembered, the other half went in one ear and out the other. The turnoff from the logging road comes after 4 miles, about a minute past the creek, and is well marked by a cairn and a log with an arrow engraved in it. Then comes a burly uphill climb on decent trail, then the trail peters out somewhat. The key now is to not lose the trail, which can be accomplished by backtracking in case you lose the trail, and some light searching around. On the way back we realized that when you get to the second creek, you want to go straight up it a couple hundred yards until you get to a cairn, and then traverse high across subalpine meadows to the notch. On the other side of the notch is the most lovely campspot, but we forwent it (?forgoed? dang English language) for a shorter approach the next day. So we kept traversing toward the glacier for an hour and spent the first night on the S side of the notch below McMillan, just above a weird little glacial lake. \
\
We left camp around 5:30 in the morning and ascended toward the glacier, which turned out to be a lot more sporting than expected. We found an easy way through the icefall though, and soon landed at the base of the buttress between the W ridge gully and the S Face. The very clever plan was to avoid the nasty West Gully, and instead climb up the start of the South Face route and then cut over onto the West Ridge. What could possibly go wrong? \
\
For starters, it might have been a good idea to start where the route starts, instead of a couple pitches below it. To get to the South Face start, we should have gone up the glacier some more, over a super dicey snow bridge. Instead we climbed the buttress in four short pitches, and an interesting dihedral followed by some downclimbing got us onto a ledge at the base of the S Face. I insisted on starting up further right, because I saw an easy way up and didn't believe Eric who thought that the start was further left. Anyway, it worked pretty well, and we climbed up the face on nice 4.0-5.6 rock for three pitches. Protection was tolerable, but definitely not plentiful. I led the third face pitch to the right-slanting ramp where the S route goes, and where we should have gone left to join the W Ridge. Our description though said to go straight up (which wasn't right, because we were too far right), so I dumbly went straight up. From that belay, Eric fruitlessly tried three different ways which were way too hard and wouldn't have gotten us anywhere, so we decided to cut our losses and back off. It was an unsavory thought to rap down though - the entire way we hadn't seen any anchors, and unless we could find the legendary and sought-after S Face rap route, we'd have to leave gear. We decided to downclimb as much as possible, and look for rap anchors, and suppress any nervousness. \
After downclimbing half a pitch, we could see the ramp where we should have gone left. It was 2pm by now. Should we go for it? It was an extremely hot day, the sun was bashing us and not the slightest air movement reached the sheltered South Face. Neither of us could recall ever being baked slowly in a 120 degree oven like that. So thirsty! We decided we wouldn't possibly have any fun if we tried to go for the top, it would've been another four and a half pitches at least, plus a long descent. No way. So we started looking for those anchors. Thing was, we couldn't even find a place to rap off a fifty dollar cam! So I led out further west on a ledge system, further, further, sweat, worry, aha! I spotted a rock horn. AHA! It had a sling on it. Yay, we were saved. Good thing about the double ropes, eh, because single rope raps would've ended us in the middle of a blank face. Instead, we found a second anchor consisting of an old tricam, an old nut, and a sling looped over a little corner, which we backed up with another sling. That got us back onto the glacier, where we thirstily lapped up water from a trickle in the moat. \
\
Now all was good. We went to bag McMillan Spire via the West route, which wasn't exactly fun, but necessary to dispel the sadness that resulted from the rejection we had received from mean Inspiration Peak. Pout. We could see a bunch of cool stuff from the top, as you might imagine. The way down went quickly with some fine turns on our nifty one-foot skis (aka squishy boots). We stuffed our camp into the backpacks, and moved to the pretty site. We were briefly inspired by the beauty of it all, then fell asleep. \
\
The hike out the next morning went smoothly, except that I was in the early stages of heat stroke and had to take long breaks to avoid fainting. It took 5 1/2 hours. Then we ate a bunch of food at the Good Food, and fed onions to a dumb puppy who didn't know how to catch."
"index","more Indexing today","I hadn't been out since July 14 and was feeling antsy.  We managed to sneak out to Index for a few hours of climbing, getting back to Seattle by 1 PM and without my advisor suspecting a thing (he'd wring my neck if he found out that I went climbing this morning instead of working).  \
\
I led up Godzilla, which I had been wanting to do for quite a while.  \
\
Then Eric showed me the GM area.  I led up the first pitch (5.<!-- s8) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cool.gif\"" alt=\""8)\"" title=\""Cool\"" /><!-- s8) --> and Eric led the second (5.9).  The second pitch was a bunch of laybacking up an offwidth.  We tried to TR the offwidth without laybacking, but it was too awkward (apparently ChucK@CC was recommending the *third* pitch of GM as practice for the Stuart Gendarme).  \
\
Then from the top of the second pitch, I led up the .10a handcrack on Heart of the Country.  Sweet crack, a little fun entering it from below when it's thin and curvy.  We had a hand-sized cam left over (ummm, actually several... I got in the \""every hand feels like a belay\"" zone and ran it out a bit <!-- s:) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\"" alt=\"":)\"" title=\""Smile\"" /><!-- s:) -->), which worked quite well as a high directional for belaying up the follower (the bolt anchors are awkwardly off to the side)."

"Mount-rainier","Rainier, Fri July 18 - Sat July 19","We set off from Paradise around noon on Friday.  The weather was gorgeous\
and we could see Adams, Hood, and St. Helens.  We crossed the Nisqually\
easily -- all the crevasses were open and visible.  Then we ascended\
without adventure towards Camp Hazard.  We'd heard reports of rock\
fall at Hazard so we opted to camp at some lower spot.  The sunset was\
awesome, with the mountain casting a blue shadow onto the pink\
atmosphere.  The campsite was crummy, surrounded by crappy rock and\
continually buffeted by the wind.  But such were all the campsites\
along that stretch.\
\
We melted water in the evening, drank, ate, and pretended to sleep until\
3am.  We left camp at 4am, some using headlamps and a couple walking by\
the light of the dawn and the half moon.  We found the steepest part of\
the Kautz Glacier (some 200 vertical feet) to be such hard ice that our\
axes were virtually useless.  However, there were plenty of handholds\
and the climbing was fun.  An earlier party had left their rope in place\
and we attached ourselves with prusiks, saving some time by not having\
to fix our own.\
\
From above this point on it was largely a long slog for the last 2000ft.\
The crevasses were visible and we stepped over or around them easily.\
The snow provided perfect traction for our cramponed feet.  By this\
point our two rope teams (Matt, Gretchen, and Joan; Russ, Mark, and me)\
had split up because we were going at different paces.  Supposedly,\
Matt was stopping to take too many photos.  We summited around noon,\
glanced at Seattle, congratulated ourselves, and scurried off the top.\
The 40 or 50mph winds made it DAMN cold to be up there.  We sat around\
in the summit crater for some 20 minutes and began the descent.\
\
We rapelled down the steep part of the Kautz, sharing ropes and anchor\
with another team.  I had a mild headache and Gretchen was feeling \
nauseous, probably due to dehydration, possibly supplemented by\
altitude.  We packed up camp on the way and reached Paradise by 8pm.\
Mark and Matt didn't even bother to rope up across the Nisqually, but\
I got squirrely and halfway across questioned the decision.  Russ\
didn't debate the point and immediately offered to rope up, and Joan\
and Gretchen silently joined us.\
\
We were all tired and probably ready to be done a few hours before we\
actually reached the parking lot, but all happy to have summited and\
all greatly enjoying sliding down the mountain on our butts."

"dragontail-peak","Dragontail - Backbone Ridge (sort of)","Had a friend visiting from back east that wanted to get out for a \""good long day of adventuring\"" so I decided we would do a car-to-car on backbone ridge on Dragontail. We packed adequate gear for the legendary off-width and headed off. We left the trailhead at 3:15 on Monday and reached the lake by 5:30 ish. Stashed some gear and water at the lake and were at the base of the route (after a bunch of scrambling) at 7:30 when we started climbing. There is a good bit of easy scrambling to find the start of the route, a 5.6 corner, which is supposed to lead to the ridge and the off-width. We somehow scrambled to high, and then missed the fist pitch, opting for a different corner. Committing and runout climbing made retreat impossible, so we just kept going up. Four 59.5 meter pitches later we merged back up with the route around the 5th pitch. The rest of the climb was fantastic, with a few pitches of really nice rock on the upper fin. We reached the summit at 3:15, so 7:45 on the route. Kind of slow, but we had a lot of routefinding issues on the fist half of the route. Took our time back to the base and the car because of the heat. Reached the car a little before 8. Good day.\
\
I'm a little bummed that we missed the off-width pitch because I have heard so many horror stories about it, but none the less, it was a fun and really long climb. Our start variation was pretty fun in its own right, an although it may not have been as strenuous as the off-width, was probably of at least a similar grade. \
\
Cool climb. Short approach with light packs. Surprisingly easy for a car to car assent. Highly recommended. Happy to provide beta on finding the right start for anyone who is interested."

"buckner-mountain","Buckner North Face TR","This climb seems like it is very popular this year! However, the place still seems very remote and we saw nobody the entire day after we left Sahale Moraine. A beautiful route as advertised and everything is still in good shape. \
\
Aaron Z and I bivied up at the Sahale Moraine and enjoyed a nice evening and night under the stars. Woke up with the light to start the climbing. The Sahale/Boston traverse was awesome in the early morning light. \
\
It appears that the Boston Glacier has opened up more over the past couple weeks or even days, but nothing that is not easily navigable. We dropped down a little lower to avoid some crevasses. We were actually turned around at one point when we stayed high because we didn't want to downclimb over a couple open crevasses. \
\
The bergshrund about a 1/3 up the north face is still navigable as well. The part right above the shrund seemed the most intense to me. The final part to the summit, while possibly a couple degrees steeper, was in the open so it didn't seem as bad. The snow was soft and crampons worked well on the slope. We didn't place any protection, but there were a couple spots where a picket or two might have been a good idea. The summit affords one of the best views I have ever seen with the sprawling Boston Glacier my favorite part. \
\
The traverse around Horseshoe basin was straightforward. The waterfalls from the ice cliff on the Davenport were spectacular. We took the moat up the snow finger (snow in finger was very hard for some reason) and the beta from previous climbers was great putting us on the trail up the ridge to Sahale moraine. We reluctantly packed up and hiked down to the car exhausted. We left the parking lot right as light was starting to fade. A sunrise to sunset climb. An awesome couple days in the North Cascades with a great partner!"

We waited behind no one, had MattP guide us to the start of the route, climbed and rapped quickly and efficiently, and had cool temperatures and way too much extra water (Colin and I carried 5L of water on route and drank maybe a liter; Eric brought a gallon of grapefruit juice in addition to however much water Ralph had).  \

You're right, it is easy to second-guess someone when you are sitting in front of your computer.\

"Mount-olympus","Climbing Pirates of Olympus TR 2003","August 2003\
\
Me and Aaron Z decided it was time for us to head over to the Pennisula and climb Olympus.\
\
Day 1:\
\
We left the Puget Sound region around 3:30 pm. After a late start and traffic snarrled roads we finally reached the Hoh Ranger station around 8:30 pm. We decided to gain a head start on the next days long 17 miles or so. so we hiked about 2 miles and camped.\
\
Day 2: \
\
We got up around 9:30 am, and started hiking. The trail was mostly flat and fairly comfortable. We made a brisk pace towards the ranger station. This is where the fun began. While I was sitting on the bench outside the ranger station. Aaron went around back to check out what was inside. A ranger was upstairs sleeping and thought Aaron was trying to go commando and break into the hut. He ran outside and demanded that Aaron show him his permit. He ran back inside and notified the local authorities that Aaron was trying to break into the hut. With a sadistic smile on his face he came out and told us that he had called the local police and we would have to deal with it when we got back to the Hoh Ranger Station. This particular ranger would make an excellent corrupt Police officer. Supposdly Aaron commited a federal crime by standing on top of a bench. So this put a little damper on our trip. STupid ranger was probably pissed cause we woke him up from a wet dream... \
     We continued up the trailhead towards elk lake. It was a lonnnnnnnnnnng ways a way. and we finally made it to glacier meadows around 5:30 pm. We didnt pass many climbers, except for one European fellow and his cute girlfriend...  We probably hiked close to 15 miles the second day. After a nice rest bit we had warm soup and noodles. To make the night pass well, I brought a long 4 small bottles of Canadian whishey and some burning 50% proof russian vodka. It really kept me warm an happy  <!-- s:roll: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_rolleyes.gif\"" alt=\"":roll:\"" title=\""Rolling Eyes\"" /><!-- s:roll: --> .\
\
Day 3:\
\
We got up around 9 am to start the climb. We probably didn't get on the glacier till about 10 am. The route to the snowdome was fairly obvious, we decided that we would climb a steep coluier to the snow dome. It proved to be alot faster, but a bit tricky. Views of the olympics were pretty awesome!!!  Kinda reminded me of Southeast Alaska.. IT was great!! around 1:30 pm we reached the base of the rock pyramid. There was a group of 6 people using guides for the climb. They were taking forever. In fact they left camp 4 hours before us, and they were still trying to make there way up the rock face by the time we got there! go figure... So we waited for them to come down, and we exchanged a few kind words. other then the guided group we were the only other group of climbers on the summit.  I thought the summit block was going to be harder, so I brought a few \""friends\"" size #1-3 and a whole range of stoppers.  But it turns out we really did not need them. There was alot of exposure on the summit, and maybe a few 5.0 moves on the final pitch. By the time we reached the summit the olympics were shrouded in clouds. No cool views of the pacific ocean or cascade range. We made two quick repells, and glissaded down the glacier. \
    We finally passed the guided party after the snow dome. We got to camp around 6 pm and we quicky packed our things for the long hike out. After much deliberation and debate we decided to try and make the entire 17 mile hike back to the ranger station. only 8 miles from the trail head we ran out of light and decided to bivy in the dirt.\
\
day 4:\
\
The next morning we quickly made our way back to the trailhead. Unfortunately Aaron thought my car was towed and went to the ranger station. They were going to let us go, but the head of the gestapo decided he wanted to interrogate us further. After waiting for an hour, he interrogated Aaron and then me regarding the incident at the guard house. He said he may press charges against AAron, and he tried to bamboozel me into admitting that Aaron intended to break into the ranger station. AFter about 2 hours of intimidation he finally let us go.. I seriously think these people need to find better things to do with there time!!!  Anyways Im back home, and im happy we did this climb. its beautiful and worth it. Every climber should make the trip at least once!  its worth it... <!-- s:twisted: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_twisted.gif\"" alt=\"":twisted:\"" title=\""Twisted Evil\"" /><!-- s:twisted: -->"
"index","Yet even more Index","I cursed and thrutched through a squeeze chimney and then flailed my way up a 4\"" crack, having to hang on gear once.  The mighty forearm jam was quite helpful.  Eric followed up, suffering similarly, ripping off a scab on his knee that has been getting ripped off for the past few weeks.  And that was that for the third pitch of G-M.  We then TR-ed HoC p3 (including the short 5.11 extension) a few times and TRed G-M p3.  \
\
After that, we played around on 5.10 face climb variation instead of the 3rd-class walk-around to gain the base of GM p1.  We could barely do one move of it and \
were wondering if it was really a 5.10...  \
\
Then we tried to find a TR-able wall of knobs, as described in the guidebook.  We didn't,\
but we came across a finger crack that looked like fun... fun for someone thirty years ago.\
Eric led the gardening job, excavating the crack with his nut tool so he could place pro.\
Things that looked like jugs were really piles of dirt.  Halfway up, he came across an old piton.  I cleaned things out more on the rap down.  When fully cleaned, it would probably \
be an Index 5.8."
"Mount-logan","Mt. Logan TR","My partner and I climbed Mt. Logan over two days this weekend. We left the trailhead on Saturday at 9:45 and walked the 18+ miles to just near Park Creek Pass. The last two miles in Thunder Basin were brushy, but otherwise the trail was in fine shape. However, there was more elevation gain and loss along the way than we expected. The 1000+ ft gain to junction is immediately lost and it is brutal on the way back to gain that elevation.  \
\
Bivied up near the pass and began the climb the next morning at 6 am. Skies were clear at night and the moon was very bright. The sky was already clouding up when we woke up and thunder clouds could be seen to the west. We hiked the climbers path 1 mile and then an easy traverse for another mile to a wide gully which is ascended to the Fremont Glacier at 8000 ft. The lower face of the glacier is mostly ice with crevasses, but a route on the left avoids most of the ice and the crevasses higher are easy to negotiate. Here, we had 10 minutes of rain/hail, the only major precipitation we saw the whole trip. \
\
From the top of the Fremont Glacier, the scrambling to the summit of Logan was straightforward. Fortunately, the sun came out and the rock dried. The traverse is exposed 3rd class with a couple exposed 4th class moves just before the very small 9087 ft summit. We were able to enjoy the summit for a half an hour in the sun with clear skies to the east and storms to the west. Interestingly, there were no low clouds at this point so while it was cloudy to the west, the view from Glacier Peak to the Pickets was unimpeded (cloud deck at approx. 11k ft). My favorite view was the North Face of Goode and the Boston Glacier. \
\
We arrived back to the camp spot at 1:45 pm, ate, packed up, and departed for the loooooong hike out. The weather on the way out was a mixed bag of sun and sprinkles, but low clouds had surrounded the peaks by now. I completed the hike out at 9:40 pm and my partner at 11:15 pm. We were both exhausted and happy to be done with the trail. We saw no climbers, hikers, or anybody the entire length of the trip! \
\
Mt. Logan is a really long, but feasible 2 day trip. Next time I will consider the approach via Lake Chelan and do it in three days. The view from the summit is one of the best I have seen and I will definitely return to this beautiful area."
"mount-stuart","Just another wannabe chestbeat TR....","I finally thrashed my way up Stuart's N. Ridge yesterday. The ridge was less exciting than I had hoped for, but the gendarm made it all worthwhile, with two pitches of 5.9. The first pitch had me scared shitless, heel hooking the top of the pedastal riding an adrenaline high like I haven't had for months. After hauling the packs, I set off on the 2nd pitch, the famous off width. Way dicier than the first pitch, my huge mitts were too big to fist-jam, barely, so I was left with few options other than layback the offwidth section. Got to the wide part of the crack, slipped inside, and grinned wildly for a few minutes. After continuing to the belay, I got both arms to cramp up while hauling the packs. Not pleasant. We got lost getting to the summit from the Gendarme, doing a rappel and a few more pitches of 5th class to the summit at 7:45. We got 1500 feet down the Cascadian Couloir, bivies with rocks poking us around, came down the couloir this morning. Hiked out, drove back to Seattle, and slept.\
\
Conclusion: a kick-ass route if you include the Gendarme. These two pitches make it all worthwhile. We belayed every pitch, doing it in about 17 pitches with a 60m rope. Took us forever, 9:45 from the notch. Each of the Gendarme pitches took 45min, and we probably wasted an hour or so (maybe more) getting to the summit from the Gendarme. This is a LONG route, the approach is long, the ridge is long, and the descent is long. \
\
Why do it? After doing the Gendarme pitches, I'd have to answer \""cause endorphins feel good\"".  <!-- s8) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cool.gif\"" alt=\""8)\"" title=\""Cool\"" /><!-- s8) -->  \
\
End chestbeat. \
\
BTW, the notch couloir is free of snow, just some scrambling. The Cascadian has quite some snow at the top. The ridge proper is not as technical nor as exposed as I had thought. Do the gendarme, it's really, really, really, really, cool."
,"stuart descent","If it was earlier in the season (I think JJantz said he was up there two months ago), one could descend the Sherpa Glacier.  The Sherpa Glacier Couloir is only about 40-45 degrees, quite reasonable to downclimb.  There is a bergscrhund, but it can be bypassed easily or stepped over, in early season.  Later in the season, I've heard the bergschrund can become more of a problem."
"liberty-bell-mountain","Washington Pass Extravaganza","I went on a four-day trip with the Mounties, led by Steve Firebaugh.  The trip was an absolute joy because the party of four as a whole was strong, and Steve is super strong.\

quick summary:\
Liberty Bell: Barberpole, Overexposure \
Concord: Cave Route\
NEWS: NW Corner\
SEWS: SW Rib, East Buttress Direct\
Cutthroat: South Buttess\
\
Thurs:\
Climbed Barberpole on Liberty Bell.  5.9 rating seemed a little generous -- the climbing wasn't that hard.  I think I had the hardest lead, the slabby traverse under the Hercan Roofs followed by the finger crack corner.  The climb is definitely more of an adventure climb than a classic, but still a lot of fun.  Try to avoid the granola granite.  Anyway, we summited before 11:00 and were at the Concord/Liberty Bell notch by noon.  So we decided to do another route.  Forty-five minutes later we were on top of Concord via the Cave Route.  The first pitch has a hard move or two (5.7+ according to Beckey) that's a little balancy.  On top of Concord, we saw an inexperienced party struggling up the 3rd pitch of the Beckey Route... the leader would go up ten feet, pull out the topo, climb back down, etc.  He started drifting off-route so we sent him back on-route, only for him to drift off-route again... We rapped off Concord and met them on Liberty Bell by climbing Overexposure in one pitch (fun 5.8 towards the top, a little loose at the bottom).  \
\
Fri: \
Climbed South Buttress of Cutthroat.  We simuled the lower stuff until we got to about three pitches from the top.  We fooled around a little, trying to take a harder line up (the rock crapped out above a roof, so we left some gear to retrieve on rap and lowered off.  The true summit was swarming with flies, but luckily about ten feet below was okay.  We downclimbed/rapped the route (maybe 6 single-rope rappels?), using two ropes (two teams of two) for greater efficiency (person with the second rope sets up the next rappel while the rest of the party is still rapping).  We were car-to-car in 6.5 hours, and were in Winthrop showering before 3 PM.  \
\
Sat: \
\
Fourth wasn't feeling so good, so we climbed as a team of three today.  We climbed the NW Corner on NEWS in three pitches: first pitch takes you to the large ledge shared by West Face and NW Corner (walk left around the corner to get to the next pitch), the second pitch is the lieback/undercling around the flakes, and the third pitch (my pitch on lead) is the offwidth dihedral followed by slabby stuff, a small roof, and face climbing (try to avoid ropedrag... I used two double slings girth-hitched together for the piece of pro I placed in the alcove).  After those three pitches, it's a scramble to the top.  We took doubles of Camelots 3, 3.5, 4 and found them to be really helpful.  The description of the third pitch in the guidebook seems a little misleading... it describes it as an offwidth workout for 20 feet that eases off.  The offwidth workout didn't seem that bad, and it didn't ease off that much.  \
\
We summited before noon and decided to do another route... the SW Rib of SEWS.  Two pitches led up to a large ledge, where the standard route goes left around a corner, but I got the opportunity to lead a gorgeous finger/hand crack that went straight up the steep face (Beckey rates it a 5.9, but we think that's a little sandbagged <!-- s:) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\"" alt=\"":)\"" title=\""Smile\"" /><!-- s:) -->).  There's a small ledge with a good stance about 15 feet up the crack, but it's pretty committing until then.\
After the crack, 5.6+ slabs took me to the base of the Bearhug... I had to run it out considerably (at least fifty feet) because the only pro possibility was a small cam that I used in the crack.  The Bearhug pitch is overrated (it should only be 5.6 or so) and you should not haul a bigass cam up there.  Plug in a good #4 Friend to protect the bottom of the Bearhag.  We had a #5 Friend with us, but it was almost tipped out higher up in the crack... just suck it up and climb.  After the Bearhug pitch, one more pitch takes you to the gully -- just scramble up that short 5.2 crack to the summit.  \
\
Sun: \
\
Again, our fourth wasn't feeling well, so we were a party of three.  We did the East Buttress Direct of SEWS, approaching from Blue Lake trail.  We cached packs at the base of South Arete and scrambled down choss to get to the start of the route.  We soloed the first pitch and a half, belaying at a horn where it started to get harder.  I got the first lead (5.9+), sending me up the dihedral, past the roof, and up the next dihedral (we combined those two pitches into one).  For that long, relentless lead, I was glad to have doubles of Camelots .75-3.  We then moved the belay about thirty feet up and right to the base of the bolt ladder.  The first led the bolt ladder by pulling on bolts, belaying (semi-hanging) at two bolts about 10 feet left of the crack.  The second cleaned and led off on the next pitch while the third prusiked up a fixed line.  Bring narrow-gate biners for the bolt ladder -- about half the bolts have homemade hangers with small holes.  The next pitch (connecting the two bolt ladders) seemed really freaky.  After the crack (5.9), there is virtually no pro available on an up and left face traverse (5.7?) for about fifty feet to the ledge.  Of course, the second cleaned everything, not leaving any directionals in, so when I had to follow the face *and* the crack, I was looking at a huge pendulum... yuck.  The next pitch was mine, pulling on bolts for the first part, then some stemming and liebacking and a 5.10 mantle onto a sloping ledge.  About six feet below the ledge were two fixed nuts; I was able to get in a red alien a few feet higher to protect the move.  About a hundred feet of easier climbing took me to a big ledge and the end of the pitch.  One more pitch led up to the ridge, and then a short pitch to traverse to the summit (with the freaky, airy, I-can't believe-it's-only-5.4 step down.  We summited a little before 2:00.  We downclimbed the South Arete to the top of the chimney and did two raps to reach the ground.  \
\
Epilogue:\
\
Whew, that was a lot of climbing.  It was a tremendous experience to climb with someone as strong and experienced as Steve.  I learned a lot about traveling fast and efficiently, as well as going light and carrying little.  All the practice at Index really helped, although there's nothing at Index that I've seen that's quite like the dihedrals (both on NWC and EBD) that I encountered.  It seems that when you do a harder route at WaPass, you should expect to have to run out slabs a few grades lower (but apparently the hand-traverse/walk the ridgetop on South Arete is now protected with a bolt).  And now I need a rest from climbing!"
"Mount-rainier","Rainier DC TR","Went up to Muir with the multitudes of people on Tuesday the 19th and summited at sunrise on Wednesday the 20th. Not a cloud in the sky, light winds, and relatively warm temperatures for the summit. \
\
The route is good shape with the boot track well in place. The guides put up a fixed line in a couple sketchy spots. One party was departing the summit at sunrise which seemed odd. A group of three UW climbers and my team of three were the next to reach the summit. We stayed for an hour after sunrise enjoying the views. It was nice to do the route and be at the top with few people around. \
\
6 hrs to the Columbia Crest summit from Muir and 3 hrs down. Everybody who made the summit, which was less than half of those at the camp, came from the DC route. It looks like the other options on the mountain are narrowing. An enjoyable trip up an awesome mountain and a sunrise I will not forget!"
,"Route ratings at &quot;new&quot; X38 crags","So the new Garth Bruce guidebook to X38 is out, and all things considered it is a pretty fine publication.  Since returning from Wyoming a couple weeks ago I have been doing lots of climbing on the north side of the valley in what is called The Far Side, using this guidebook as reference.  The quality of routes over there is pretty good, and over the course of four visits so far I have climbed most of the lines under 5.11.\
\
My observation, shared by a few friends, is that the ratings at Exit 38, particularly at The Far Side, are misleading.  This is no fault of the guidebook author (although he climbed most of these routes before publishing his book.)  I would like to know what other members of UWCC think about the accuracy of the ratings at X38.\
\
My experience at X38 (Far Side in particular) is that the ratings are consistently high by two or three grades.  This can cause problems, because lots of climbers who learn to lead 5.10 on the short, tame and well-bolted routes of X38 will then go to Index/Leavenworth/Smith and get their asses handed to them on a 5.7.  Sure, it is the responsibility of the individual to select appropriate climbs, and you should never count 100% on the accuracy of any guidebook, but some of the routes at X38 are ridiculously over-rated.  This gives you a distorted idea of what grade you can actually climb, and can be confusing (not to mention frustrating) when you go somewhere else nearby.\
\
Examples from The Far Side (some route names forgotten and the book isn't handy)\
\
1.  Endless Bliss, 5.10a, 40m, 4 stars, supposedly the best route at X38, is closer to 5.8\
2.  __? ? ?___, 5.10a, middle of Eastern Block crag, is closer to 5.8\
3.  __? ? ?___, 5.10b, right side of Eastern Block, is closer to 5.9\
4.  __? ? ?___, 5.10b, right side of Slabbage Patch at Overhaul, is closer to 5.9\
5.  __? ? ?___, 5.10b, right side of Headlight Point, is closer to 5.9\
\
These are the ratings I would give them, others might disagree, but I think in general once you climb at other crags around the region you will agree that in general the ratings at X38 are excessively generous.\
\
Your thoughts?"
"index","unofficial UWCC shendig on GNS (Index)","Ania and I went to Index Saturday to climb some stuff.  It was her third day of leading trad.  We got there early, and after I led the fist crack, she lead Scimtar Crack, Pisces Crack, and Twin Cracks. We then TR-ed Breakfast of Champions a few times.  Lo and behold, there is Stebbi and Lilja, Ralph and Betsy, and Mike Schmitt.  We then TR-ed Libra Crack and played with building gear anchors.\
\
After lunch, I led up the finger crack and evil chimney of Lizard.  Ania led the next pitch, and just as I was about to tell her to watch out for the rope getting stuck behind the flake/roof, a train whizzed by.  Drats.  Turns out that after the train went away, the rope was stuck in two places... behind the flake and in the crack above, wedged into a cam.  I told her to clip into a piece where she was, and then I tied her off, self-belayed on lead to fix things, and then put her back on belay so she could finish the pitch.  \
\
After that, Ania led up the finger crack, and we set a top-rope on the 5.10d arete.  I mightily flailed on it, but I did figure out a way up it, and Ralph even has photographic evidence of it (no GPS data though).  Ania fared much better on it, and didn't have to resort to any French, I mean, Freedom tactics.   We then climbed Princely Ambitions as the sun set.  Amazing views...golden trees, red peaks...  \
\
On PA, there's a booty TCU behind the flake just before the slab traverse... I futzed around with it a little bit while on lead and couldn't do much.  You don't have access to it on rappel... best for the follower to hang and play with it."
"snowking-mountain","TR: Snowking","On Sunday I climbed Snowking with Matt DePies.  We left Seattle at 5am and drove to Marblemount to register.   The driving info we had we decided to take Matt's truck to go the extra ~ 1 mi down the road.  We drove Cascade River Road (14.5 mi) to Kindy Creek Rd (FS 1570), which was a moderately descent one.  Beckey talks about a truck being able to get to the end, from the looks of it that hasn't happened in a few years.  We parked and were walking at 8 am.  \
\
The first section is along an abandoned dirt road and about .75 mi later the trail takes a turn for the steep.  For the next 2 hours we walked through the forest before coming out on Kindy Ridge.  The trail follows the ups and downs of the ridge until it reaches Cyclone Lake.  From the lake there are two options, and we chose to go up the ridge on the west side of the lake.  The going up the talus field/slabs was pretty easy and we got to the edge of the glacier and roped up.  The glacier was somewhat broken up and the cravasses were quite easy to avoid.   A short while later we were scrambleing up class 3 rock towards the summit (3:30 pm).   On the summit we were treated to spectacular views of Eldorado, Forbidden, the Ptarmigan Traverse Peaks, Glacier Peak, and countless others.\
\
After spending ~45 min on the summit we descented back to the glacier.  For variety we stayed on glacier and followed the rock ridge down (east then north).  We reached Cyclone lake before 6pm and headed back to the car.  The return trip had lots of ups and downs which took awhile for us tired climbers.   The last 1.5 hrs we used headlamps and lost the trail once, but by backtracking we quickly found it again.  We reached the car at 9:30 pm.  \
\
I would recommend it as a two day, but doable in one.  Afterall, Cyclone lake is an extremely scenic spot to camp.  All in all a great trip with beautiful views."
"Forbidden-peak","Forbidden","Hi all,\
\
OK, I have a newbie question.  \
\
For the climb of the Forbidden N. Ridge, I take it the standard approach is to ascend Boston Basin to Sharkfin Col, and rap down from the Col to the Boston Glacier.  Some parties choose to bivy on the Boston Glacier and carry over, which makes sense to me.  But thinking of the worst case scenario, what happens if the weather turns foul and you decide to bail, and you are already on the Boston Glacier?  What are the options to get back to the trailhead, without ascending Forbidden itself?  Would the best bet be to ascend the Boston glacier to Boston Peak, and then traverse over the summit of Sahale, and down the Sahale Arm?\
\
Thanks for any advice.  Just want to have some idea of how committed I am, once I rap over Sharkfin Col.\

Cheers,\
Steve"

Last weekend a few of us hiking into Gothic Basin and went up Gothic Peak and Del Campo.  Ended up turned around and in a pretty bad place on Gothic for a while (you know you're in trouble when you find a rap station while downclimbing) but found Del Campo to be a solid, moderately exposed scramble.  Just stay out of the gully below the notch and everything will be fine.\
\
On Wednesday Jen and I headed up to Vesper Peak.  Some of the most interesting rock I've seen since coming to Washington.  We took the scrambling route to the summit from Headlee Pass - I'll have to learn to climb before I'd try any of the other faces!  We traversed over to just below Sperry Peak before calling it day and heading back to the car.  Beckey rates the traverse Class 3, but he must have been higher on the rocks than we were.\
\
All the peaks were almost entirely snow free.  If you went really out of your way on Del Campo you could probably step on a small patch of snow, but there's no reason to bring an ice axe.\
\
Has anyone tried the 3rd class route on Morning Star that branches off from the Sunrise Mine Trail about a half mile in?"
"Mount-maude","TR:  Maude via Entiat Icefall","Short version:  Elain and I climbed Mount Maude via the Entiat Icefall route over Labor Day weekend, using the Entiat River trail for the approach and the return.  We had an unplanned bivouac on the descent.\

,"Bug City","[Here's a little something I wrote during a storm the other week. Writing seems to come easier during the middle of the night out in the mountains. Denali and the AK range loomed closeby.]\
\
So the Presidents of the United States of America sing this song entitled \""Bug City\"". All too often it seems to emerge as a theme during the warmer months. A while back, Josh Poirier and I headed into the Enchantments. We had planned on climbing the full North Ridge of Mount Stuart. Things weren't so bad leaving the car around 7pm. Bugs were in the air but were not overwhelming. Ninety minutes passed and we found ourselves at Stuart Lake. I donned my jacket and attempted to handhold a photo in the waning warm light. Now one must realize it is not a normal occurance for me to wear a jacket, let alone a shirt between April and October. The Bugs had stepped it up.\
\
Continuing our relaxed pace, more time passed and we found ourselves passing along bogs below the north side of Stuart. The sun's last rays waved goodbye to granite faces and ridges. The drone was now constant. We found a relatively flat place to sleep along the \""trail\"". Magically I produced a bug net from my pack. We placed it over our heads and tried tucking it in against the ground. The buzzing critters were relentless. Sleep came but for a scant hour and a half. By 3:30 am we were tired of this torture. It was time to move. I busied myself with preparation while Josh waited. At some point we began ascending what seemed to be a climber's path through the forest. \
\
Bug bites announced themselves throughout my body. I'm not sure how, but mosquitos managed to infiltrate the netting and my sleeping bag to then bite the bottom of my feet  through my wool socks. They also decided my butt was a prime target while I 'slept'. They bit through my pants and underwear. Would nothing stop them <!-- s:?: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_question.gif\"" alt=\"":?:\"" title=\""Question\"" /><!-- s:?: --> \
\
Time trickled by. Sweat dripped as we gained elevation. The cool water from the stream was soothing. Warm light embraced Mt. Stuart once again. Finally we were in the snow and began to leave the trees behind. We hoped the cold temps bespoken by the icy snow would quell our friends. Unfortunately, these were andriod mosquitos. They followed our every move. \
\
Soon our troubles were made evident in the daylight. As we popped out on the ridge above a frozen tarn we spotted our problem. Now across from the Stuart Glacier we would need to descend, regain our lost vert on the glacier, then traverse towards the bottom of the North Ridge. Time was not on our side and the chopping steps with rocks would not be a speedy enterprise. At times the running shoes need assistance  <!-- s:( --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_sad.gif\"" alt=\"":(\"" title=\""Sad\"" /><!-- s:( --> \
\
The proper route was determined. There was no reason to linger. We descended. Perhaps I'll look at a guidebook next time. The bugs were even more relentless. I dislike them on my face and abhor them in my eyes. Large bites plastered our faces. Day hikers asked if I was ok. A couple below Stuart Lake offered me some bug juice but somehow I declined. We returned to Chelan and rested after the battle. \
\
So next time you find yourself traveling to bug city come prepared; bring the zapper."
,"W Butt Blueberry Hill","Ania and I climbed the West Buttress of Blueberry Hill last Saturday.  \
\
We soloed the first two pitches, she lead the crux pitch, I led a pitch, and then she led until we hit the terrace.  From there, we traversed left and a little bit down around a corner.  A full length of rope put me on slabby ground forty feet above my last piece; I downclimbed some and set up a mediocre belay.  About sixty feet below me, Ania was able to traverse over to a tree and set up a happier belay.  I then led a full length of rope to the top, placing one more piece (a tricam in a shallow slot).  The climbing, though runout, was 5.4-5.6ish.  \
\
A short bushwhack uphill took us to the summit and nice views.  Beckey calls the summit the hardest 4000-ft summit in the state, and MattP notes how few make it up because they turn around at the terraces.  It's definitely worth going all the way up, and the runout slabs give a sense of adventure not present on the straight-forward route-finding on the lower pitches.  \
\
The way down was very slow at first... rappels on shallow slabs with bushes and rocks in the way... ropes getting tangled... ick.  Our final rappel through the trees left us thirty feet above the Westward Ho anchors... ugh.  A few more rappel antics and acrobatics and we were back at our packs.  The walk down was uneventful; we wore our rockshoes.\
\
Oh yeah... the Granite Sidewalk is very very cool...\
\
and... we used Ania's booty orange alien (she found it the weekend before) a lot!\

,"Exit 32 may be worse","I haven't used the new X38 guide, but made a few random comparisons and found that MOST of the climbs mirror the ratings in the old Bryan Burdo book...cept the new ones, of course.\
Now I haven't used or seen Burdo's old X32 guide, but my partner has. After using a preview copy of the NEW X32 guide with her, she's convinced that basically all the climbs we've done on Little Si are over-rated by at least a grade in the new guide. So, if you think those X38 ratings are soft, you'll probably think the new X32 guide ratings are softer.\

"Kyes-peak","Almost Kyes Peak TR - 9/13","Attempted Kyes Peak on Saturday.  Beautiful weather and views, but I underestimated the difficulty of the ascent and round trip time.  \
\
Left from Blanca Lake trailhead around 9:20 and reached Blanca Lake a bit after 11.  Went around the west side on a nice climber's trail and then up through the boulder field to the base of the Columbia Glacier - which is really melting out this time of year.  Ascended the glacier (barely needed an axe there was so much loose gravel on the ice) to the \""break in the cliffs\"" as described by Beckey.  The ascent from the glacier to the \""heather knob at 6500\"" gives loose rock a bad name.  Alternated between churning uphill through dirt and scree and sliding up sandy slabs.  Wasn't feeling too good about going back down by the time I reached the final ridge towards the summit.  \
\
About a 1/4 mile from the summit (and 200 feet below), I ran into a couple just coming down who told me the summit block was \""solid 4th class\"".  Not really in the mood to tempt the fates any further, I decided to join them descending the South Ridge route.  I'm firmly convinced there has to be a better route than we took - which involved some rather ridiculous heather traversing and \""green\"" belays.  Eventually the trail solidified and we returned to Virgin Lake around 7:20.  Motivated by the promise of a quart of water in the trunk of my car, I managed to reach the trailhead a bit after 8.  First time I've been glad to have my headlamp with me!\
\
Having gone up via the glacier and down via the South Ridge, it seems like the glacier route would be preferable if you could find some solid rock to descend.  You would lose elevation much faster and once you returned to the glacier it would be an easy (and faster) walk out (aside from regaining all the elevation up from Blanca to Virgin Lake).  \
\
Part of me wishes I'd tried the summit, but since I was by myself it just didn't seem like a good idea.  Perhaps that's the lesson learned.  Also need to start carrying some water tablets with me on longer scrambles.  Running out of water just plain sucks.  If anyone's thinking about going back that way in the next few weeks, I'd be interested in going along and summiting this time."
,"Bivy ideas","Ben,\
\
Thanks for the bivy ideas.  I'm going to try out the idea of carrying a two-person bivy sack/tent.  Just bought a Bibler I-Tent for this purpose.  Will carry it without the poles, should be just over 2.5 lbs without the poles.  \
\
I tried that \""plastic bag\"" idea on Maude.  Took a plastic garbage bag and cut arm-holes and a hole for my head using my pen knife.  It made a nice \""wind shirt\"".  Not very breathable, however.  <!-- s:-) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\"" alt=\"":-)\"" title=\""Smile\"" /><!-- s:-) -->\

"Snowfield-peak","Snowfield Peak almost TR","Snowfield Peak boring TR - 9/13-14/03\
\
Five of us, Dan, Ralph, Jule, Kevin and I, climbed into Dan's van and drove to the Pyramid Lake trailhead.  The trail went quickly to the remarkably un-impressive lake, then more slowly up the steep climbers path to Pyramid Ridge, through some brush, up and down some steep sections with roots as foot and hand holds to a delightful heather meadow with views north of the Pickets, Jack and Ross Lake, and close by of Colonial and Pyramid.  We followed some talus to the base of the Colonial Glacier where recent glacier retreat is forming a beautiful pea soup colored lake.  We climbed up the glacier to a col between the Colonial and Neve glacier and relaxed at scenic, high bivy sites.  At sunset, Kevin and I climbed to a small knob for photos while Dan scampered to a different one and noticed the weather might be changing a little early as clouds began to infiltrate the Northern Cascades.  Shortly before sunrise, the clouds began streaking overhead at an alarming rate and the wind began to howl.  Kevin woke me in the dark before dawn for more photos.  Shivering, we climbed high to set up for what could be an insane sunrise.  Clouds were beginning to capture the highest peaks and flirted with Snowfield.  1000ft overhead, they raced from Baker to Washington Pass in a few minutes.  Rain began across the Skagit and quickly sprinkles started to fall on our windy outpost.  It spread east, into Thunder Creek then continued in streaks towards Ragged Ridge and Black Peak.  There was sliver of light on the eastern horizon;  would the sun rise for a few minutes of outerworldly color before the storm could blot it out?  Unfortunately, it took it's jolly time and the storm won.  We packed, climbed back to camp in the stiff wind and rescued Dan's Puffy Jacket from the grips of some menacing rocks.  Jule, Kevin and Dan seriously considered climbing Snowfield in the storm but wimpy Ralph and I talked them out of it.  Good thing too, because as we were descending down the Colonial Glacier, the peaks really got socked in.  It would have turned into a windy, wet and cold (we were 800ft below the freezing level) sufferfest in the fog.  Back at the heather meadow, a rainbow briefly appeared before more clouds and rain.  The climbers path was soon behind us as we sped towards Marblemount and burgers, fries and ice cream shakes."
,"Don't get caught by the ranger","Alrighty, so, I went to see Sandi, but really to see the new climbing wall. Sandi wasn't there, which didn't matter, because I didn't really have anything to say to her, but unfortunately the new IMA extension is still off limits to plebs and pedestrians. I think there may even be a forest service ranger patrolling the halls and looking at permits. \
\
To get in there, first enter the IMA. Try not to look suspicious as you present your student card. Go down one floor. Then pick the hallway west towards campus. You will be underneath the open space outside the IMA entrance. Almost at the end is a hallway that goes north and has construction-no-access tape blocking it. There are coeds patrolling but they will not bother you, unless you look at them too hard which I didn't do because I'm married. Sneak by. Bypassing the tape likely looks less suspicious than ducking under it.  Hop along, then go up the stairs on your left. If you meet someone, pretend that you run the place. It's not a good idea to get off where the office is, two floors up I think, because that's where the staff offices are now. Go all the way up. At the top of the stairs, exit onto the red carpeted running track that goes around the top of the building. You'll see into a basketball court one or two floors down. You'll look around trying to figure out where this big climbing wall room is supposed to be and almost despair, thinking it was all a lie, they've decided to put in some fucking overgrown fancy basketball court instead but not told us because we're the climbing club and they'd rather fool us up there to feed us to the dogs and now they're letting the Rottweilers out. But it's all there and you can get onto the balcony next to the 40' lead wall and look down at the glory. \
\
I kind of felt let down. It's not really a lot of wall. It's kind of small from up top. I counted 18 top rope anchors and there isn't much bouldering. Ayyayay, caramba. But don't give up. Reassume your unsuspicious appearance of owning the place. Continue along the red carpeted top floor running track. That thing is so weird, it's like the red carpet to the Oscars party only you never get there just go round and round. There will be blonde haired theatre students collapsing from dehydration from walking round and round if not for us climbing and grunting and filling the air with chalk and sweating and stinking up the place, thereby relieving it of any semblance to Hollywood. Find the other, smaller stairwell. That way you don't have to worry about the office or the ranger. Go two floors down, exit the stairwell. Look sweaty and important. Angle right. Look for something that looks like a cave entrance, which is how the climbing wall room feels when the lights are off. Get ready to be stunned. \
\
The texture on at least two of the walls is frigging amazing. I swear they make that plastic out of sandstone. The plastic has cracks and they're simply awesome. You will have no skin, and Sandi will have to hire people to clean your flesh off the wall. Climbing isn't climbing if the back of your hand touches the stone but this is plastic so it doesn't count. The walls have bolts with regular (Metolius?) hangers. Maybe it will be a bring your own draws thing? Then there will be fewer people in there. The floor has carpet and feels like sponge. It definitely beats the back seat of any car, bet Sandi didn't think of that possibility at all when they decided to not go with pea gravel. Whatever. Best of all, the tall walls are severely overhanging and there is even a roof that looks way fucking hard. W-a-y fucking hard, at least from 25' below. But then again there isn't any of that pesky colored plastic. I'm volunteering for route setter and all my route setting activity is going to consist of removing the pesky colored plastic, teeheehee. Then there will be fewer people in there. And, with that kind of route setting there is no need to wash the dishes, I mean, holds. You see, they didn't put in a dishwasher to wash the holds, just a sink, so route setters are actually going to spend most of their time dish washing. But that's alright, because if the holds are always the same then people will lose interest. Then there will be fewer people in there. \
\
To sum up, the place looks amazing, but kind of small. We really need to pool our resources to figure out how to get as few members in the climbing club as possible. Then there will be fewer people in there. It's a tall order, but we can do it."
"three-o-clock-rock","Fun at Darrington","Saturday, Steve Friebaugh and I climbed privately (i.e. not an official Mounties outing) at 3-o-Clock Rock, doing Total Soul and Silent Running.  Total Soul is quite a spectacular route, going up a striking quartz dike in the middle.  Like its neighbor Silent Running, it is well-protected.  Kudos to the dudes who put up those routes on lead, bolting as they go, and without the luxury of modern rock shoes.\
\
Sunday, two more Mounties joined us, and we climbed Dreamer.  The first two picthes had a few wet spots, despite a full day of dry weather on Saturday.  I got to lead both the Blue Crack pitch and the following pitch because the two others weren't up for leading them (this caused a great deal of clusterfuck because they wanted to be partnered together, but we had to flake and retie and rearrange the rope teams halfway up).  Both pitches are absolutely delightful, provided that both the climber and the belayer manage the ropes carefully.  The two pitches consist of traversing under a roof, going up, and cutting back.  Ropes were fine on the first pitch, but on the second pitch, I was climbing with doubles and forgot to watch one of them when I traversed under the roof... it got stuck, and by the time I had finally straightened everything out, I had traversed the roof back and forth another two times <!-- s:roll: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_rolleyes.gif\"" alt=\"":roll:\"" title=\""Rolling Eyes\"" /><!-- s:roll: -->.  \
The knobby second-to-last pitch is an absolute joy.  It's steep, and supposedly 5.8, but the knobs were so good that it felt easier than the other 5.8 pitches on the route.  \
\
Compared to stuff at 3-o-Clock Rock, Dreamer is significantly more run-out (but not as much as Static Point, so I've heard).  Some pitches on Dreamer might have as much as 30 feet of 5.6-5.7 off the anchor before pro is available.  Some pitches have a fair amount of attention-getting traverses on slabs and knobs.  For me at least, traversing doesn't feel as comfortable as climbing up.   \
\
Pictures to come later...."
"cadet-peak","Cadet Peak - 9/24","Scrambled Cadet Peak on Wednesday.  It's one of those peaks in Beckey with three sentences for the approach route, but turns out to be a bit more complicated.\
\
Cadet Peak sits on the north side of Glacier Basin above the Monte Cristo townsite.  Biking in is a must - unless you relish walking four miles of road from the gate at Barlow.  There's an astonishing amount of junk left over from the mining days strewn about the basin - among the highlights: half a shoe, half a cup, several miles of rusted steel cable from the fallen ore trams.  Glacier Basin was beautiful and the clouds over the peaks broke just before I started up Cadet.\
\
I successfully located the \""obvious gully near the house-sized boulder\"" but missed the turn into the \""smaller gully branching left\"" and ended up contemplating a vertical climb up a mostly dry waterfall.  Deciding that was stupid, I backtracked, tried another gully, again got stopped by steep rock, then finally bushwhacked uphill through some cedars.  Traversing the hillside, I found the \""smaller gully\"" and picked up a \""trail\"" up the heather slopes.  After another wrong turn (the north side of Cadet is *very* steep) and a few short scrambles I reached the top and was treated to views of Wilman's Peak, Monte Cristo, Kyes, Foggy, and Columbia.  All look very cool, but rather technical, so I should probably at least learn to rappel before giving them a go.   <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\"" alt=\"":shock:\"" title=\""Shocked\"" /><!-- s:shock: -->\
\
On the way down, managed to lose the \""trail\"" again (or maybe the trail lost me), but located the descent gully and returned to Glacier Basin without incident.  For anyone thinking about trying this one, the \""smaller gully branching left\"" is the first left branching gully.  Of course, this gully isn't visible from within the main gully.  Look for a jumble of rusty brown rock to stay on route.  Solid scramble with a pretty short approach, but kind of hard to stay on route in the heather and the loose rock can be \""interesting\""."
"vesper-peak","Vesper","KAROOMPH!  Not the sound you want to hear in an Alpine setting.  A huge slab of snow 5 feet in front of me just gave way, as Eric Gratz fifteen feet below me on the Vesper Glacier and I now at the very top of the glacier watched in horror.  The slab slid down the bare rock and underneath the glacier beneath my feet.  \""Let's get the hell off this thing!\"" I shouted and made my way as quickly as possible to the exit point off the glacier I had been pursuing as the ice creaked beneath me.  Eric noted while laughing nervously, \""holy crap, that scared the crap out of [i:j00jx2tf]me[/i:j00jx2tf], and you were the one right next to it.\""   \""Yeah I think I just lost my bowels.  I can hear the ice moving, I have to get down.\""  I responded, still moving to the edge.  KAROOMPH! Again that same noise, but this time I was falling straight down, riding the glacier wave into the darkness of the belly of the glacier.  In that four or five seconds a thousand thoughts about death raced through my mind, and I could painlessly feel my limbs being battered, my head hitting the ice, and my stomach being pounded, as I waited for the crushing blow that I knew would kill me.  Not today though, I stopped some thirty feet dowslope from where I fell, under the glacier, clinging to wet rock and mud, and an ice arete.  The rock sloped sharply down from where I was deep under the glacier, ten more feet and there would likely be no escape.  \""Are you alright!?\"" came the shout from Eric as he was now running and jumping to get off this murderous sheet of ice.  \""I'm alright,\""  I responded as convincingly as I could, but as I tried to crawl uphill out from under the ice to the rock refuge my left leg wouldn't hold my weight, and it was becoming increasingly difficult to breathe.  I found I was still holding my ice axe, which helped as I clawed up to a point where I could comfortably lay down.  I was shaking, hyperventilating, and getting nauseous as the classic symptoms of shock swpet over me.  I told Eric, \""Im going into shock,\""  and tried to fight it off.  \
\
Only four hours before I fell Eric and I were already feeling a bit pessimistic about the climb, the falling rain coming in direct contradiction to the \""partly cloudy\"" forecast.  The forecast called for improving weather, however, so we pressed on up the Sunrise Mine trail through forest, meadows, and boulder fields.  We just hoped the sun would come out in time to at least partially dry out the north face route which was our goal. Being a bit out of shape I spent the time going up to Headlee Pass trying to catch up to Eric, who stopped occasionally to scare awaythe snaffles with some falling rocks.  We reached the campsites at the lake between Speary and Vesper in reduced visibility, so we got out the compass and chose a likely gap to shoot for.  We had chosen wisely, but had to downclimb some third class mossy, wet rock to gain the glacier and cross it to get to our route.  At the glacier we discussed where we were going and how to get there.  By now the rain had stopped and sunlight could sometimes be seen.  Eric said that in this late season hard ice there was no way either of  us could arrest the other's fall,and he felt comfortable stepping in the large, flat suncups.  So we went unroped the hundred yards to the other side to discover a moat much larger than anything we had anticipated.  We talked about digging a bollard to rappel into the hole, going back and doing the scramble route, and ascending farther up the glacier to look for another place to exit. We could see some ice fingers that extended to the rock farther up and decided to go for it.  We had to climb around a big crevasse, but the going was easy and I didn't think anything of it.  The going was a little tougher as I made my way across a snowbridge that in retrospect was really sketchy.  Eric followed until I got to the ice that allowed an easy exit from the glacier when the shelf above me gave way, shortly followed by myself. \
\
Once we were in a safe position, Eric examined my injuries, specifically my left leg which had developed a big lump that I could see through my polypro long underwear.  After his checkup it became apparent my leg wasn't broken, but my ribs on my right side hurt like hell.  It was pure fire when I tried to breathe too deeply, and sharp pain when breathing normally.  Moving my right arm also became a painful task.  I told Eric to get me my jacket, aspirin, water, and some food.  I took some time to rest and ice my larger bruises, as we talked about what might what have happened if we were roped, if we tried something else, if I hadn't been wearing my helmet, etc.  The conclusion was that I was very lucky, and even though it probably wouldn't have helped much in this situation, I resolved to always rope up on a glacier, no matter how small or unbroken. The most difficult task was just beginning however. We had to decide on an exit plan, and with the option of continuing up a third class gully or descending the glacier, we chose to go up the gully to regain the scramble route.  Using my ultra-long iceaxe as a walking stick, and with Eric carrying both our packs, I spent one of the most painful half-hours of my life making my way to easier ground.  My entire left side from my shoulder to my ankle was badly scraped and bruised and my rib inury seared everytime I had to grab a hold with my right hand.  At the top of the gully we reached the sun and smooth slabs that didn't hurt nearly so badly to walk on as the choss below us.  We still had to go uphill to reach the boot path of the scramble route, which was no fun, but once there we met a group who gave me much stronger Ibuprofen to supplement my weak generic aspirin.  With much stronger drugs in my system, and the feeling that I could likely walk out, we moved with more confidence and made our way back over Headlee Pass, down the scree slopes, through meadows and forest and finally back to the car.  I actually felt very limber and could breathe easier after the few hours of walking so decided to drive myself, and no longer felt so intent about making my way directly to a hospital.  \
\
I had x-rays taken last night after the climb and was told that I had a crack in one of my lower ribs, but with the perkocet the doctor prescribed me, I'm feeling pretty good.  My father made a great series of images describing the fall in detail which I'll post when I get the chance.  Right now, I'm just thankful to be alive, and that Eric was there to help me."
"index","Index Extravaganza","Dan Perrakis and I went to Index this past hot, sunny Sunday.  For a warmup, I sandbagged Dan and convinced him to lead the first pitch of Aries (the short 5.8 fist crack to the ledge).  He flailed, bailed, and then followed it with no problems.  After that humbling experience, Dan led the next pitch of Aries (the finger crack), then the Taurus groove to the upper part of Pisces, all of which made him feel much better.\
\
We then headed over to Roger's Corner and into the oven.  While sitting at the belay in the glaring white corner at midday, feeling my feet melt into the rock, I pined for my water bottle at the ledge below.  We both needed a good liter of liquid to wash down our Breakfast of Champions, but there was no hurry in making the 100' free rappel on Dan's black rope in the blazing sun, lest we toast our bare brake hands.\
\
In the shade below Princely Ambitions we lounged and gaped at climbers on Sagitarius and Japanese Gardens.  One last effort got us up PA and I exorcised the personal demons by leading the second pitch, where I had sprained my ankle in a lead fall in January.  Pulling the twisted rope after rappelling was the crux, with Dan and I both yarding on the stupid thing.\
\
We waited out the traffic on Highway 2 with beer and meat at the diner in Gold Bar.\

,"N Cascades Hwy by bike","I finally finished my secret project that had been years in the making: bicycle up to Washington Pass from the lowlands. As a partner/victim I selected my naive brother who had just come over from Germany and had never seen the place, so he believed me when I told him \""it's fun!\"". \
\
At first, it was a lot of fun:\

\
We started out from Newhalem at 9am, the weather was sweet, smoke was in the air. The one long tunnel is damn scary despite the nice flashy bicycle warning lights that come on if you push the bicycle warning light button. \
We made it up to the pass in six hours. A lot of that time we spent resting and whining (\""you didn't tell me it was THIS long!\""). But on top, an overwhelming sense of accomplishment set in.\

The way down was badass fast, and worth all the trouble. Except those parts where it didn't actually go down. We had to take some more breaks. \

"Lundin-peak","Lundin","I did Lundin (Basic Climb) with the Mounties today.  We pretty much followed Ben Dugan's instructions, traversing NW from the pond to the West Ridge.  We rapped the East Ridge past all those plaques and grotesquely large bolts/hangers and traversed the ridges to the pass.  Fun scrambling there.  The West Ridge itself was a little disappointing... not much rock, and 3rd/4th class with maybe one or two low-5th moves.  Chaining Snoqualmie with Lundin with Red and carrying a thin rap line could be fun."
"del-campo-peak","Del Campo Scrambling","Last Tuesday Micah and I head into the mountains to scramble Del Campo Peak.  Everything was straightforward until we got to the obvious gully.  We took the advice of staying left a little too seriously and went way left.  After we reached a vertical section that was probably low fifth we turned around.  We went back to the gully to have a second look and stayed much closer this time and made it up with no trouble.  The summit was great and we had pretty good weather for scrambling.  I'd love to head back to Gothic Basin to camp and do some more scrambling there.  What a beautiful place!  We talked to some hikers who spoke of a large waterfall and an abandoned mine - I want to check both those out on the next trip."
"Mount-daniel","Daniel Attempt","I'd been looking at Daniel in the Beckey Guides for quite some time and last wed/thurs I headed in with Matt.  The approach was very mellow as Cascade approaches go and 3.5 hrs later we were setting up camp at Peggys Pond.  We decided to relax the remaining part of the afternoon.  That night was absolutely stunning - it's been too long since I've seen the stars like that.\
\
The next morning we woke and headed up the glacial cirque towards the Daniel Glacier.  There was a path through part of the cirque until we reached the headwall then we picked our way along the talus/scree slopes.  When we crested the ridge we were blasted by strong gusts of wind that nearly knocked us over several times.  As we got into view of the Daniel Glacier we noticed how cracked up it was.  My partner was feeling uncomfortable on the ice with the heavy wind so we turned around.  We made our way around the ridge above the cirque looking for another way to the summit.  We found one but the day was getting on so we decided to head down.  We crossed a large hard snowfield.  I moved across relatively quickly.  I stepped around the corner to sit on the rock and remove my crampons when I heard Matt call.  Apparently he had an attack of agoraphobia (sp - the fear of not being able to get out of a situation).  His nervers were shaken so progress along the ridge was extremely slow.  I had to shuttle his pack over several trickier bits.  Eventually we made it to easier terrain and descended quickly.  The return trip back to the car also went smoothly.   The area was beautiful esp. being high on the ridge looking down at all the alpine lakes.  I definitely want to head back to summit."

ps. If I had known that was sporto laying on the asphalt things may have gone poorly for him. Josh was still wearing his work boots (team New Balance had an accidental rest day). Perhaps this would have been just what the doctor ordered though. From the sounds of it you had not climbed rock for some time; he has been \""climbing\"" regularly at Bone Gardens. I'm not good at math but ............."
"liberty-bell-mountain","Underlit","Josh and I had a free evening so we headed up to Wa Pass for some cragging. He said the NW face of Liberty Bell would be a quick romp and so it was. We walked in towards the start of the Beckey route. Not that this approach is hard to screw up but Josh had it about as dialed as can be after soloing the Beckey route waaay too much when he didn't have a partner this summer. The colors are starting to turn (an abrupt chage from the North Country where most colors have died off already) so the walk in was pretty with filtered afternoon light. There was no time for photos though. Jon on the couch had to take the day off. \
\
We found the bench below the route to be a pleasant surprise. Upward roped progess began around 4:15 pm. Most \""pitches\"" took about 30 minutes to lead and 10 minutes to follow, not super fast but not agonizingly slow. The sun hid itself from view around 6:45 and the light was diminished. Fortunately we were working on the last pitch. At some point I dug my headlamp out. Miracle of miracles, both of our headlamps worked (a first in many months), yet another pleasant surprise. We scrambled first to the west summit then to the main summit, a 5 minute task during daylight. After taking the customary summit photos we started walking down the easy way at about 8pm. Two rappels led us to the gully and another short walk brought us to our bags. This would be one of the first climbs where Josh and I did not consume all of our water in the first half of the climb.  \
\
Philosophy, well life really, was a hot topic on the walk out. Josh's work boots lessened the pleasantness of his stroll. Them boots aren't made for walkin. Soon we were in the parking lot. I was still chatting away as I noticed a host of vehicles and many illegal campers. Little thought was given to these sport utility folk though as I searched the Jeep for food. Soon a familiar voice pierced the darkness. ERIC!! We had spent a month and a half together but only a week prior had headed to separate sides of the Cascades.\

and to all a good night (except for sporto)"
"ingalls-peaks","TR: Ingalls North Peak via East Ridge","Sky Sjue wanted to start climbing rock instead of spending all his time skiing. So on Friday I bought a rack, and on Sunday we climbed Ingalls. Due to fire closures we traversed over the 'other' ingalls peak, whatever it is, adding at least an extra 1000' to the climb. We scrambled up the approach gully, and roped up at the base of a large, green, slick, chimney. Since this was Sky's first time on rock, I led all the pitches. 200 feet got us past the notch. I'd rate this pitch maybe 5.2. Then we followed the ridge crest on good rock for a few pitches until we got below the obvious crux, 100 feet from the summit. There are only two moves of significance, and neither is 5.7, I'd rate it closer to 5.5. I scrambled to the summit, brought Sky up, and we rapped and downclimbed the South Face. We then hiked out. \
\
Points:\
1. The route is much easier than I expected. Four pitches, the first three are at most 5.3. The 'crux' pitch has a fixed nut right where you want it, and the crux move is nowhere near 5.7. I'd say 5.5. \
2. No, Eric, we didn't place any pins. \
3. We took way too much gear. I used Camalots .5, 1, 2, Stopper #8?, and BD Hex # 8 or so. Most of the climbing is very, very easy, next time I'll bring the above rack and four or so double length slings. \
4. Route finding is dead easy, just follow the ridge. I couldn't find any double gendarmes. \
5. One 60m rope is plenty to rap the S face, but I'd take a shorter rope, simul the route, and downclimb the S face. \
6. A very nice route, with good rock and a nice postion, with good views of Stuart. Just don't expect it to be very technical. \
\
Noone was around due to the fire closures. We had the Stuart Range all to ourselves as far as I could tell. And the weather was nice and sunny."
"tieton","Tieton","This weekend I helped instruct at the Mountaineers crack-climbing seminar.  Instructing consisted of setting up top-ropes (by leading the routes <!-- s:) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\"" alt=\"":)\"" title=\""Smile\"" /><!-- s:) -->), offering advice to folks, saying \""good job\"" to folks, some belay duty, and occasionally doing a lap on a route.  It was a lot of fun!\
\
It was my first time to Tieton, and I was quite impressed.  There are many cracks at moderate grades, and it is often easy to TR harder ones by leading easier ones.  For that matter, you can make cracks \""harder\"" by choosing not to stem, for example.  Routes seem to have \""older\"" ratings, i.e. harder than Vantage.\
\
Some recommendations:\
\
Royal Columns:\
Mushmasher (7): hand crack that goes wide, requiring cupped hands or even fists\
Orange Sunshine (10b): fingercrack, crux at top\
Inca Road (9): handcrack that thins to fingers at crux\
Ball and Chains (9+): offwidth crack followed by juggy roof followed by finger/handcrack\
some other route that's a 5.8 that's to the right of Mushmasher... crack goes up to roof, then traverse left of roof to new crack\
\
Bend:\
Tiers (9): handcrack through double roof\
Salmon Song (10a): finger/handcrack through double roof"
"tieton","Tieton part 2 (dedicated to jjantz)","The semiarid slopes were glowing orange from the setting sun, and the pungent aromas of sagebrush filled the air.  I wasn't at all disappointed that I had forgotten the memory card for my camera at home.  I had a good day of climbing, and I was now soaking up the surroundings.  I fortified my munster cheese sandwich with snippets of sagebrush leaves as I quaffed a cold beer. \
\
After the sun went down, Steve Firebaugh and I chatted about the Mountaineers and the UW Clibming Club of Old and New.  Finally it was time for bed, and I crawled into my bivy sack.  It was still hardly dark, with a gibbous moon lighting the sky.  As the wind rustled along the ridge, I tried, and never really succeeded, in imagining what the uwcc must have been like with people like Steve Swenson [of Himalayan fame], Jim Nelson [pms dude], Dan Cauthorn [DDD], and Davis and Holland [the Index route] running around.  As the night went on, I slept lightly, waking up just as the moon was setting in a bright-orange curtain call.  I wondered what would lie ahead for the next day and went back to sleep.\
\
The new day got off to an inauspicious start as we dodged several rainshowers.  But things would quickly turn around. Some climbers leashed a huge [120 lb?], white, friendly Great Pyrenees dog to a tree, and it turns out they were trying to give him away.  He had been a stray for a year, occasionally fed by generous locals.  The guy driving me home, who has several dogs and a huge yard, offered to take him.  He named the dog Tieton, which he expects his daughter will mangle [appropriately] as Titan.  He's taking the dog to the vet tomorrow, and I think the dog will quite enjoy his new home.  The mountains always find a new way to surprise me."

Route:  Forbidden Peak (8,815’) East Ridge Direct, grade 3, 5.8\
Party:  Ralph Bodenner, Eric Gratz, Nick Bratton, party on\
\
Saturday morning we drove up to the trailhead after a quick visit to the ranger station.  The hike up to Boston Basin was quick and painless, except when I fell flat on my face ten feet up the trail.  We were all competing for lowest pack weight, and I think I won at 23 pounds without water.  In the lower section we saw two bull elk just off the trail.  At the basin we relaxed in the sun for a while before deciding to have a go at Sharkfin Tower in the early afternoon.  We took one pack and ascended to the edge of the Quien Sabe Glacier below Sharkfin.\
\
Above us was a group of three climbers inexplicably heading up the most rotten looking couloir in sight.  They were also moving pretty slowly.  After watching them for a little while we decided it was a little late in the day to start this route, so we headed back to the basin to make camp.\
\
About an hour before sunset we saw a team of two on the east ridge of Forbidden moving slowly towards the summit.  We lost sight of them before dark.  After dinner a fellow showed up asking where the AMGA guides were, and we said we didn’t know.  We did tell him about everyone we had seen that day, and he wandered off.  He was looking for the group which was taking their exam.\
\
At six on Sunday morning we were up, began our approach before seven.  We took one pack, my pair of double ropes, crampons and axes.  The approach up the polished glacial slabs was fairly straightforward and the short snow section was nice and crispy.  Some loose scrambling took us to the base of the route where we stashed our shoes and extra gear.  We were roped up and climbing at 8:45.  \
\
Conditions were excellent.  It was great to be climbing a mountain route this far north in October wearing t-shirts.  The sun shone on us all day and the smoke from the forest fire gathered in a low haze in the valleys.\
\
Eric led the first couple pitches, some of which involved simul-climbing.  The rock quality was poor, there were lots of unstable chunks and some sections were more crumbly than a brick of feta cheese.  The guidebooks describe the rock quality favorably, so perhaps I am just spoiled by the consistent solidity of the granite in the Wind Rivers in Wyoming.  \
\
Our route took us directly over all the gendarmes on the ridge.  Interestingly, the rock quality improved substantially on the more difficult sections of climbing.  If this inverse relationship holds true, then 5.9 routes must be awesome in the North Cascades.   Eric did a nice job of leading some slabby, exposed traverse moves on one of the lower gendarmes.  Ralph then took the sharp end to down climb the largest of the gendarmes.  We were moving at a decent pace and had one party behind us.  The constant exposure of being on the narrow ridge crest added an extra element of excitement to the climb, it was cool to be so high up above the glaciers on a two-foot wide ridge.\
\
The next fun part came on the 5.7 moves gaining the top of the two-tiered gendarme.  Ralph led this section with aplomb and soon we were all gathered on the knife-edged peak setting up a rappel.  Once down in the next notch, Eric led the crux 5.8 pitch of the last gendarme.  Behind us we noticed that the other team was climbing was making up for their lack of helmets by sporting some white tennis shoes.  They were also sticking to the ridge for the most part, but on the more technical sections would bypass on the north.  We also noticed a team on the north ridge, and guessed that they were one of the AMGA groups.  One more pitch of simul-climbing brought us to the summit, and we had gorgeous views.\
\
Our first two rappels down the northeast face went well, then we realized that all the rap stations were set up for single ropes, so having doubles only allowed us to skip one.  We passed Team Tennis Shoes on our second rap, they were skirting the 5.8 gendarme and still nearly an hour below the summit.  The AMGA guides had topped out and dislodged some large rocks that came a little too close to us for comfort.  The final rap station was suspect, and we left one of my stoppers to back it up.\
\
The traverse across the loose, 4th class section of the NE face was a little stressful.  The route was not obvious for the first couple hundred feet, and the gaping crevasses of the Boston Glacier were a constant reminder to what the consequences of a fall were.  I roped up with Ralph for the last bit, then the slope mellowed out and we had a short scramble to regain the ridge.\
\
We were back at the base of the route just before five, and were eager to get back to camp before dark since routefinding on the slabs would be less fun.  We returned to camp at 6:30, and were hiking back down the trail by seven.  The descent took us 1.5 hours including a little route re-finding on the far side of the avy path.  Two cars were still at the trailhead when we left, so I hope they don’t get stuck in there since the road is closing today for repairs.  Making that traverse of the NE face in the dark would be fairly hard and not at all fun.\
\
You don’t need a whole lot of gear for this route.  We did fine with one set of stoppers, seven cams, and one hex.  Simul-climbing the first and last pitch helped keep things moving.\
\
Hopefully Ralph will post some of the photos he took."
"Glacier-peak","Glacier Peak (via Glacier Gap) - 7/3-7/5","Michelle, Amittai, and I had been talking about a trip back into the Snowfield group for 4th of July weekend since our climb of Trapper's Peak a few weeks back. Her father (Peter) and Wendy (who many of you met last year) rounded out our merry band. However, on Friday morning, I discovered that a large fire was now burning in the Panther Creek drainage. While I do love the smell of napalm in the morning, we decided that we'd rather not get smoked out of the area and changed our plans. 

Glacier Peak quickly rose to the top of the list and I'm a sucker for that one (as indicated by [url=http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/climb/forum/viewtopic&#46;php?f=34&amp;t=4885:blqxgj6s]this[/url:blqxgj6s], [url=http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/climb/forum/viewtopic&#46;php?f=34&amp;t=2273:blqxgj6s]this[/url:blqxgj6s], [url=http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/climb/forum/viewtopic&#46;php?f=34&amp;t=2210:blqxgj6s]this[/url:blqxgj6s], and [url=http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/climb/forum/viewtopic&#46;php?f=34&amp;t=554:blqxgj6s]this[/url:blqxgj6s]. (historical note: having been back to Glacier a number of times, I remain at a complete loss as to where Charles, Dolly, and I walked on our first attempt).

[b:blqxgj6s]Day 1: N. Fork Sauk Trail to White Chuck Basin[/b:blqxgj6s]

Departing Seattle at a somewhat unreasonable hour on Saturday morning, we made good time to the trailhead. The damage to the road from winter storms has been repaired and the Mountain Loop is in generally excellent shape. Pursued by a pack of ravenous mosquitoes, we hoofed it up the first five miles to the Makinaw &quot;Shelter&quot; in good time, swapping leads with Matt and Jim, UWCC alums (at least Matt is) who [url=http&#58;//www&#46;turns-all-year&#46;com/skiing_snowboarding/trip_reports/index&#46;php?topic=13792&#46;0:blqxgj6s]skied the peak[/url:blqxgj6s] as a two day trip. Red Creek crossing was relatively straightforward on a trio of downed logs about 30 yards upstream from the trail crossing. There is some surveying tape in the area that might be a fore-runner to a new bridge, but perhaps best not to get ones hopes up.

From the Makinaw Shelter, the trail gains 3000' in less than 3 miles. By this point, it was also blazingly hot, with minimal shade. The first 2000' were the worst, but the heat started to abate and the views opened up above 5000'. Beautiful wildflower displays higher up, but (sadly) neither bears nor porcupines.

We took a brief break at White Pass to rest our feet and recharge for the hike into White Chuck basin. While stopped, a hiker/fisherman with two dogs came along and asked us how to get to Round Lake. He was very off-route, having mistook the N. Fork Sauk trail for the Lost Creek Ridge trail and walked along since 8:30 am (now around 5:00 pm). The argument about where he was got a little heated until Amittai broke things open by recalling that his car (a black hummer) was indeed parked at the N. Fork TH. Proof that having a map and knowing how to use a map are two entirely different things (e.g. your map says the trail to Round Lake switchbacks mercilessly from the road, but you walked 5+ miles of flat).

After this entertainment, we followed the well-established climber's route towards White Chuck basin, treading upon the front doors of many a marmot. We crossed the ridgeline to climber's right of the rockiest and craggiest of the small humps running east from White Mountain and enjoyed a short boot ski down into the basin. We pitched our tents on an island of rock and dirt in a sea of snow. Near by was a large, flat granite slab we dubbed &quot;the dining room table&quot;. An advantage to our choice of sites was a complete dearth of bugs - welcome after the biting flies at White Pass. We dozed off quickly after dinner, alarms set for 5:30 the next morning.

[b:blqxgj6s]Day 2: Glacier Peak[/b:blqxgj6s]

A bit of time was required to brew coffee the next morning, so we didn't exactly manage an alpine start, but were all moving up the basin by 7 am and to Glacier Gap by 8:30 am. I was a little apprehensive about our pace and the warmth of the day given recent events on Mt. Hood, but things worked out fine and we were able to give a very wide berth to the only area notable for rock fall. The walk from Glacier Gap to the Gerdine Glacier at 8400' is one of my favorites in the Cascades (else I wouldn't keep going back): peaks in every direction, climber's path barely visible amongst the well-consolidate pumice, and bouquets of wildflowers adding splashes of color.

We roped up (most for the practice) at 8400' and (after some shenanigans with ropes and prussiks) set out across the Gerdine towards the 9200' gap east of Disappointment Peak. Very few crevasses were visible this time of year and we made great time to the gap, on to the Cool Glacier, and up to the saddle between Disappointment and Glacier Peaks. The pumice from 9600' to 10500' was tedious, but easy and then the final snow slopes to the summit added a bit of spice. 

By 2:30 pm we were all happily on the summit, soaking in the views and snapping pictures. Second volcano for Amittai in two weeks. I believe he's formulating plans to climb both Rainier and Adams next weekend to up the ante (kidding). 

The return trip really flew by (until we were in the lower White Chuck basin) and we returned to warm food and cold beers by 7 pm. 

[b:blqxgj6s]Day 3: &quot;Just like day 1, only wetter&quot;[/b:blqxgj6s]

We awoke Monday morning to find ourselves completely socked in, down to (at best) a few hundred feet of visibility. Then it started to shower. Fortunately, the showers stopped long enough to pack up camp and the sun came out brightly enough to warrant sun block and sun glasses. However, this appears to have scared the sun and the clouds and showers returned as we crested the ridge to return to White Pass. The scuttled otherwise sound plans to climb White Mountain. The way down is much like the way up, but the swirling clouds did change the feel of the slopes and forests.

Back to the car by 5 pm, where the hordes of mosquitoes were lying in wait. 

Great time on a mountain with a great group. Good times, all!  <!-- s:drink2: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/drinking45.gif\"" alt=\"":drink2:\"" title=\""Drinking\"" /><!-- s:drink2: -->

"snow-creek-wall","Snow Creek Wall - Outer Space","My friend, Deryck, and I climbed outer space on snow creek wall yesterday.   Pretty good weather for as late in the season as it was, although we were sprinkled on for about 5 minutes for pitch #5. \
\
 We drove to Levy on Saturday night and wound up way the heck up Icicle road in search of a campsite (durn Octoberfest).  Eventually we found a campsite and settled in for a few hours.  Left the parking lot at 6:45 a.m. and was at the base of the climb by 8:15 a.m..  We sqaw one party ahead of us already scrambling up the 4th class start off to the right (came to find out they bivied right below the wall near the creek --hardcore).  We fired up the alternate start at 9:00, 4th class and 5.0 to get to two tree ledge.  Then I led the crux pitch which didn't really feel that hard, but maybe I had built it up a little too much in my head.  Another pitch and up to the splitter 5.7 chickenhed-fest.  These two pitches were the most unbelievable 5.7 pitches I've ever climbed.  It was like vertical chickenhead hiking, with great hand jams and solid gear.  topped out at 2:30 p.m. to find NO GOATS, bummer. \
\
The descent sucked. Back at the car by 5:00p.m.  Only saw two other parties of two.  Had a few Icicle Pale Ales to top it off in Levy.  Thought about buying some lederhosen..."

Gotta love the smell of sage during different times of day eh. Most of my favorite \""photos do not exist on film, only in my mind. The UWCC is interesting to think about, the faces that have passed through, the seasons it has witnessed- abundant life, near death, and regrowth. Erc and I ran across the coolest dog when we were in Kennicott Alaska (old mining town inside Wrangell St. Elias Park where ESPN 2 was fliming). It reminded me of the dog I had in high school. It even followed us out on the glacier (it had good sense avoiding cracks but even so we leashed it up for sections with a quad length runner). Ela was a little concerned but I think females are given stronger sense of protection. We called it Princess for the day and later found her name to be Tannah. The Bidwell's dog will chase, capture, and chew on large chunks of ice that reach terminal velocity before striking the deck at the bottom of an ice climb. Mr. Bratton's hund will take down and subsequently pin sport climbers.  Dogs are good. Dogs and day climbs are better. \

To our surprise, we also found Steve Firebaugh, and were joined shortly later by Wayne and Colin.  We played on Dogleg Crack, Meatgrinder Crack, and Z Crack, all of which I highly recommend. \
\
I flailed and flailed on the crux of Z Crack, only to watch Wayne send it smoothly in sneakers.\
\
It rained solidly overnight and was still raining in the morning, so Brian (cbs), Simona (dryad), Steve and myself went to Vantage for the afternoon.  I led Steel Grill, we then top-roped Stems&Seeds, Steve led Sinsemilla, I led Air Guitar, and Steve led Pony Keg.  \
I highly recommend all of them.  The ratings seem all screwed up though.  Steel Grill was a 9, which seemed like a good old-school rating, whereas Party In Your Pants seems easy for an 8.  I thought that Steve said that Stems&Seeds is a 10c, but Smoot lists it as an 11c... feels more like 11-.  Sinsemilla is rated 10c but feels more like a 10b.  Smoot lists Air Guitar has .10b... it should either be 9+ or 10a, just like Pony Keg.  \
\
Steel Grill is way cool.  Alternating segments of handcrack and offwidth, protects well with hexes.  \

The hardest part for me on Air Guitar was the thin crack at the bottom.  The wide part near the chains didn't feel bad at all."
"Mount-formidable","Formidable Attempt","About a year ago I saw a photo in the Beckey guide much like this one:
[url=http&#58;//good-times&#46;webshots&#46;com/photo/2740338500101779210CtyjDa:i6t301v3][img:i6t301v3]http&#58;//inlinethumb59&#46;webshots&#46;com/44282/2740338500101779210S600x600Q85&#46;jpg[/img:i6t301v3][/url:i6t301v3]

The route goes straight up the glacier, then gains the ridge following just shy of the right-hand skyline to the summit. 

The route info went something like “ascend icefalls of varying complexity and gain the N ridge for 5.0 climbing on solid, well-broken rock”. 

I did a bit more internet research and didn’t come up with any TRs on this route. I did find a TR of the 2002 F.A. of the nearby NE face. Some info here convinced me that the icefall portion of the climb was very doable. So Hayley and I set out on Friday to find out why this route sees so few ascents. 

We started up the Cascade Pass trail at 1 pm in blazing hot temps. Hhhmmm…… this place is oddly familiar, almost as if we were just here last week. Only this time we had even heavier packs. In addition to everything that we carried for Buckner, we now had 3 days worth of food (well actually 5 days due to overpacking) and a full rock rack because you never know what 5.0 climbing means to Beckey. We reached Cascade Pass and, for the first time, we went the other way; away from Sahale and up over the shoulder of Mix-up peak to the Cache glacier. During this traverse we hit the first of many “no fall zones”, as the snow-fields we traversed rapidly ended in cliffs.

We reached Cache Col for our first view of Formidable. YUCK! The lower slopes of the Formidable Glacier were riddled with rocks; even the upper slopes had some debris.

We made the 800’ descending traverse down to Kool-Aid lake (still snow-covered, but running water at the outlet) and made camp. A bit discouraged, we still debated the route some and decided to carry our gear over the Red Ledge the following morning for a closer look and we would do the scramble route if we decided to bail.

Morning came quickly and we set off at 4:30 am hoping to hit the route early while things were still frozen. Unfortunately, things never froze and we approached in slush.

We got another look at the debris, warm temps even before sunrise and decided to do the scramble route. We began ascending the Middle Cascade Glacier.
A much less Formidable path:

At the end of the glacier we reached the Spider-Formidable col and got a look deep into the North Cascades. So many mountains!

We traversed again to a notch that would gain Formidable’s south slopes. This is where I believe that we made our route-finding error. The guide book says to cross the SSW spur, which we did. We then took the first gulley after the spur, the gulley quickly ended and we saw nothing but black rock towers reaching in every direction. We were only a couple hundred feet below the summit, but couldn’t figure out how to get there. 
[url=http&#58;//good-times&#46;webshots&#46;com/photo/2898631380101779210nvyWas:i6t301v3][img:i6t301v3]http&#58;//inlinethumb62&#46;webshots&#46;com/44733/2898631380101779210S600x600Q85&#46;jpg[/img:i6t301v3][/url:i6t301v3]
Now that I am back here, I have looked at more route descriptions for the South side and it appears (according to Steph Abegg’s TR) that we should have ascended the gulley right before the crossing. The route looks quite doable from back here at my desk, but we didn’t notice it then.

We returned to camp and enjoyed a spectacular sunset, goats in camp and a good dinner before passing out from exhaustion.

The next morning, we shouldered our ridiculously heavy packs (mostly full of gear that we didn’t even use!) and made the hike out. 

Despite bailing on the N ridge route idea, this turned out to be a challenging trip for us with the heavy packs, many ups and downs, slush hiking above cliffs and moats and wild terrain. This was also my first time on this side of Cascade Pass. The route follows the beginning of the Ptarmigan traverse for a while and I very much liked this part of the trip. I hope to return to this area soon to do the complete traverse and, perhaps, have another shot at Formidable.

\
\
You may recognize this person from such films as I90 Clearcut Skiing, Dumping at Mt Zaky, Meet CoolGuy and Emmons Life Force. Well, he and his partner are famous once again. A climber and pilot was spending his evening diligently surfing the internet when he noticed the above photo on Alpine Dave's site. Ever on a mission to do death del otra llado a wreckage was encountered. Yet lacking the time and resources (no snow machine or snow) to make a full recovery of the plane it was left to become one with the forest. But things were not over for the easterner on his computer. He contacted the FAA. This wreckage was not known to exist. And so the path to discovery began. For more info on the \""unknown climber\"" pick up a copy of the Wenatchee World; I have no desire to infringe on their copyrights and post it here. \

"kaleetan-peak","Kaleetan Peak 10-18","Unperturbed by a forecast of rain, Haychoi Taing, Jim Prager, and I set out to climb Kaleetan Peak on Saturday.  And, like many before us, we found the best way to prevent rain on a hike is to carry copious quantities of rain gear as ballast.  Excellent views from the summit - including Ranier, Baker, Adams, Chair, and Glacier.\
\
As scrambles go, this one is pretty benign.  Becky lists two routes, the South Ridge and East Face.  The descriptions are so short they could pretty much describe any way up to the peak.  \""Turn left, ascend gully.\""  We chose South Ridge (Direct) which was a nice Class 3 scramble up a gully to where we picked up the South Ridge trail.  Little bit of snow on the slopes below the summit, but still pretty easy route finding.  The bulk of the route is Class 2, and we found a way out of the gully on the way down that would pretty much make the entire scramble class 2.  Kudos to Jim for his gnarly ascent of a dried up waterfall.\
\
Didn't rain a drop the whole trip.  Looking forward to getting back up the Melawka Lake once there's enough snow for snowshoes."

"leavenworth-area-climbs","Great way to spend a thursday","The 5.9+ where the trail meets the rock is called Celestial Groove and it was fantastic.  \
Unfortunately due to my lack of height (5' 8\"") and not being able to reach the first jam, I took a fall seconding  the \""bouldery start\"".   Then I got it after putting a stone on top of the already there cheater stone!  \
\
The Pearly Gates crag is really sweet though, nice new bolts and chains at every belay, and since the crag was developed recently,  there are virtually no pin scars."
"mount-daniel","Mt Daniel, Oct 25","Brian and I set out into a morning of rare splendor: a fresh dusting of snow over frozen meadows, the mountains peaceful and eerie in the starlight. We'd left Seattle at 3am and started hiking up the Cathedral Rock trail in complete darkness. Nobody had been on the trail all week, except for some elk and lynx.  We saw the morning sun bathe Cathedral Rock in its golden light, and thought that was neat. Then we walked around the rock, and gasped: an alpine apparition! It was Mount Daniel, all white and snowy, and so much cooler looking than it was a few weeks ago when Bryce and I hiked by there on our way from Stevens Pass. We went by Peggy's Pond and gained the SE ridge, where the trees soon petered out and only rocks and snow were left. \
\
[img:2vbtyjgp]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/bpolagye/images/Outdoors/Daniel102503/DSCF0009&#46;JPG[/img:2vbtyjgp]\
\
The whole Daniel massif is a stark pile of volcanic stuff, with neat pillars sticking out here and there. Some were made out of black lava. \
\
[img:2vbtyjgp]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/bpolagye/images/Outdoors/Daniel102503/DSCF0014&#46;JPG[/img:2vbtyjgp]\
\
We stuck to the ridge top the entire time except when we passed beneath the East summit. This traverse was probably the diciest part of the whole climb, with steep dirt and almost crampon-worthy frozen snow. \
\
[img:2vbtyjgp]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/bpolagye/images/Outdoors/Daniel102503/DSCF0012&#46;JPG[/img:2vbtyjgp] \
\
Even that was pretty mellow though, and we were surprised by how easy our route turned out to be. It was a long and awesome ridge walk, with a lofty feeling. We scrambled over the middle summit to the E (=true) summit, which is a collection of pointy pinnacles. The views were pretty unusual, and great. \
\
[img:2vbtyjgp]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/bpolagye/images/Outdoors/Daniel102503/DSCF0023&#46;JPG[/img:2vbtyjgp]\
\
We saw all the high lakes that sit perched on shelves around the mountain. Pea Soup lake, which is at the foot of the Lynch glacier, looked about ten times as big as it was on my map. Thank you, global warming! \
\
[img:2vbtyjgp]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/bpolagye/images/Outdoors/Daniel102503/DSCF0016&#46;JPG[/img:2vbtyjgp]\
\
On the way down we sneaked by some of the bumps on the ridge and traversed/glissaded a snow field instead. We didn't see any people until we got back to Peggy's Pond. The whole climb took only 10 1/2 hours car to car, which makes it a very reasonable day trip and HIGHLY recommended."
,"Ratings at the Far Side - Mea Culpa!","Ok, after yesterday's trip to X38, I have to retract much of what I said earlier about X38. Some areas of the Far Side really are really really soft, and the grades aren't very consistent. Note that I had a good time climbing almost all of these routes. They were fun and a good place to teach/learn. But some grades were way way off.\
\
Where we started, the Gritscone, I found the grades actually pretty good. Well, at least they were in line with what I have come to expect at Exit 38 (so maybe soft by one grade or so). They were consistent, though, which works.\
\
At Headlight Point, though, they were way soft and all over the place. The worst of all was a 3-bolt, 20-foot piece of trash called Swerve that Ralph and I did. It was rated 5.7, but I swear it should have been 5.0 tops (3rd class wouldn't have been too far off). It had cracks for pro, it had jugs everywhere, it was slabby, trivial and uninteresting. More's the point, it was a pointless, totally overrated climb that likely shouldn't have been bolted in the first place. Take note: I am a proud and enthusiastic sport climber, yet I wouldn't bat an eye if this thing got chopped. It's the worst \""developed climb\"" I've seen in a long time, and I've seen some crap in my day. There were a couple of other routes to its right that were almost as bad, but this one took the cake. \
\
A few 5.8's should have been 5.6/7s, the .10b that Nick mentioned that I agree would have to be 5.9 (something about 'carnage' in the name), and a really really fun 5.11a that goes almost 30 m on some super steep juggy terrain that was really 10a/b. It's got a bunch of roofs, huge jugs, and lots of bolts (the book says 9, but actually there are about 12 I think!). It's called something like Deterrence or what. Go do it - just don't expect anything near 5.11 moves. \
\
So sorry if I talked out of my ass without knowing shit. The Far Side really is soft. People say Skaha and Squamish are soft.  Those places are incredibly hard compared with Far Side grades. Mea culpa..."
"leavenworth-area-climbs","Not Skaha","After getting kicked out of Canada, we decided to test our luck with Bavaria.  \
\
We were at Mountie Dome by about 4 PM on Saturday and got everyone up to speed on belaying and cleaning gear.  We did a few of the easier routes on Mountie Dome and then played around on the 5.9 roof problem and a few other problems.\
\
We then went to the secret bivy spot, where we bumped into a few climbers huddled by the campfire.  After food, drink, and story, we slept out under the stars, watching the occasional meteor whiz by.  \
\
In the morning  we headed out to do R&D, with a quick pitstop first at Snow Creek parking lot, where I bumped into Steve Firebaugh and crew.  We had a great time on R&D, so we then climbed further up the domes.  It turns out the wide crack pitch that we did was BOB Crack #3, rated 5.6, or old-skool 5.4, depending on which version of Kramar you read.  \
We went on further from there on easing terrain, and Erin and Irene led their first pitches ever!  We enjoyed the view up there and then plunge-stepped down the dirt back to the cars.  Then Eric and I went up Cocaine Crack, curiously bumping into Steve Firebaugh on top of Icicle Buttress just as they had finished playing around on BOB Wall (how did we not bump into each other the entire time?).  \
\
Anyway, we all had a great time, despite the issues with the border crossing.  Yumm, I also just ate one of the apples that I picked on Sat from the Poirrier Orchard... tasty!\

\
Everything went amazingly smoothly.  Everyone showed up on time at the UW rock (one person even came an hour early, thanks to Daylight Savings), and the cars reconvened at the Far Side of Exit 38 within just a few minutes of each other.  We hiked in to Gritscone.  This turned out to be an excellent area for instructing a large group.  There is a large flattish area in front of the rock where we could stand in a circle and talk about figure 8s and belaying.  Meanwhile, some of the more experienced people threw up top-ropes.  The routes are close together and range in difficulty from 5.5 (or so) to 5.11, from right to left.\
\
The teaching format was fairly relaxed.  Those who wanted a refresher listened and practiced as long as they felt they needed it.  We did not have a system for checking people off as \""certified to belay\"".  This has the advantage of being easy to manage and feeling relaxed, as well as being more akin to \""the real thing\"" where each climber has to make his/her own judgement calls about safety.  It has the disadvantage of possibly forcing new people to make those judgement calls without much experience, and opening the possibility that one first-timer might belay another first-timer in an unsafe manner.\
\
Around 1pm, we packed up and hiked over to Interstate Park.  Thanks to everyone for packing quickly and moving cohesively!  I can't imagine such a large group moving much more smoothly!  Again, the experienced people put up the 5 club ropes as top-ropes right away, and were then free to climb harder stuff on their own ropes.  We pulled the ropes around 4pm and hiked out right around dusk.\
\
It seemed like everyone got a few climbs in, and (other than Colin) everyone seemed happy.\
\
Thanks again to all the guys who helped instruct, set up top-ropes and clean them!  Paul Franklin, Ralph Bodenner, Dan Perrakis, Jeremy Holleman, Vlad Vigdorovich, Colin Forsyth...  I hope I didn't miss anyone?"
,"A Pair of Rejections &amp; a Pair of Reunions: Part 1","I was excited. It's been over a month since I've traveled abroad to Canada. We were on our way to Skaha, the land of sunshine in the pines. I've wanted to be on a joint trip with folks from the University of British Columbia for some time now; it was finally happening and on their turf. Eric powered Big Red south and we snatched some air from the railroad tracks by Safeco Field. East, go east young man. I was going home. I awaited Pentiction, Chelan and Spokane with eager eyes. After a brief gas and grocery stop in Cle Elem our tanks were filled and we were prepped for some Gratz & Jantz gourmet dinners. We headed North into the night leaving the view of Mars behind but surging into a sky hopped up on stars. Some log trucks took their time climbing Blewitt Pass but a few passes got us back in the groove. 90, 45, 22, and finally just 10 minutes more, it was Christmas eve for me as we pulled into Chelan. \
\
We were greeted by a full house as Coco and her roomate Angie had come home for the first time since Volleyball began August 1st. I brought 5 more additions to the household. Josh was decked out in dress blues, a newer T-shirt and jeans. Larry and I found plenty of things to joke around about. I came in and out of the living room as I prepared for a \""brief\"" slide show. Talk reminded me of a conversation Eric and I had in the BC Coast Range regarding UWCC meetings of days past. Yeah, so what should we talk about today. Uhhh ... let's talk about favorite climbs at Index. Gary, what do you think about Godzilla? Ohh yeah its pretty sweet but I like the killer finger locks on the third pitch of .... \
\
Finally I was ready. A tray of new material entered the rotation. A whirlwind tour of North America, Orchard Life, and a Time in Seattle was given with minimal stories. Soon, it was after midnight and people were getting sleepy. The plan was to drive north; Gary wanted to make it to Penticton that night -- maybe we should have pushed it up there. I was looking forward to sleeping under the stars again. But sometimes fate steps in. Connie asked if we would like to sleep there. I do not recall hearing any arguments and soon the living room was filled with bodies. I stayed up for a while looking for gear, bringing things inside from the van and pulling some stuff from the house for our big Canadian expedition. Josh and I chatted for a bit. We had witnessed history. It was the latest Larry had been up in the past year. \
\
As usual Larry was the first person up. He headed out to grab some groceries well before 6am. Soon I was up; Gary's bomb warning was blaring through the living room. We meandered into the kitchen to find it stocked with food. I located my North Country spice bag for the eggs and we worked on breakfast. Maple Bars, countless yogurts, pears, peaches, nuts and many other goodies waited for us on the table. In true Poirier style Larry had outdone himself. Ever since I was first adopted by this family I've gained more and more respect for each person, not for what they've done or what they've given but for who they are. I'm a simple person and am perfectly content spending my nights under the stars living luxorously with a single burner stove and a decent sleeping bag. Contrary to conceptions people may or may not have about me I find it hard at times to accept graciousness such as this. Unlike expenses on a long trip to Alaska (or through Argentina), there is no scorebook. Sometimes my talents and skills may prove useful but regardless I will alwyas be grateful to be considered a part of the family, a son rather than a visitor. Thanks you guys.\

Shortly after 7am we headed north on 97. The back seat quickly drifted off to sleep as Eric and I sampled music. Minor Threat, The Dead Kennedys and others made their message clear as we had some reflective moments passing through the Okanogan."
,"A Pair of Rejections &amp; a Pair of Reunions: Part 2","Soon we left the Columbia behind and followed a much smaller river, the Okanogan. Mist rose from the water and a coyote bounded from the road. We approached a section of the valley engulfed in an amazing line of fog. We couldn't believe others would want to sleep through such scenery. I felt a different excitement than the previous evening, wondering what new things were in store for us up North. I woke the back seat as we came into Oroville. Soon I would be home. I grabbed everyone's IDs and prepared to hand them to our friendly border guard. With minimal questioning we were handed a yellow slip and told to speak with immigration. No biggie, I'd done this before on a trip to Lillooet just after September 2001. Ryan, Marcie and myself marched into the office at the Sumas crossing to have a rather funny gentleman ask me a few questions. We left laughing after being told joke after joke ... and continued north. I had no reason to believe this would be any different. Canadians are generally much more friendly than the average America but there are exceptions. Just as a few nice people exist in the US, there are a few jerks in Canada. I just thought they all live on the East Coast. \
\
Eric and I had brought the photocopies of our birth certificates in with us. Our friendly guy at the counter explained about 8 or 9 times that these were indeed photocopies. We were grateful for this information, especially since we had just stated that ourselves. Both of us have lost our original birth certificates. I also managed to lose my passport this past spring. Continuously pointing to the sign in his booth we were reminded time and again of our ignorance. Erin's California driver's license was also explained as inadequate in his ever friendly manner. I began to become angered as I heard him use past tense regarding our trip. Soon he spoke plainly. We were not going North this weekend. He took the time out of his busy day to print out forms for each of us who were returning to the US (just three of us, the other two were free to go north). Our citizenship was marked as United States on the form. hhhmmmm. I was pissed. It is a rare day to see the CCP angry. In fact there are a very limited number of people who have seen me really upset. \
\
A gate was opened and we headed for US Customs. How long were you in Canada? uhh about 30 minutes. What was your reason for being in Canada? well ... I guess we wanted to be treated like terrorists. Are you bringing anything back into the US with you? just hate and malice .. a bit of adrenaline too. listen man, my dood and I are pretty keyed up right now. It'd probably be best if you kept the questions to a minimum. \
\
Ironically the US customs officials were really nice to us. We drove south to the first gas station (within sight of the border) to regroup. A couple of us were about to snap. I called my mom from the same phone I had announced our triumphant return from the North Country with a mortally wounded vehicle just a month prior. We shared a smiliar view on the nature of the situation. At least the world has been rid of terror. I went inside and asked about other roads heading north to the border. The guy in the station mentioned Nighthawk. \""Go south to Oroville and take a right on Central. Head up the hill. It's about five miles.\"" We loaded back into the van and headed south to Oroville, then west and north towards the Nighthawk crossing. Just 13 miles from Oroville, up a beautiful valley tracing the Okanogan we reached the crossing tucked in between farm houses. Questioning went normally until we were asked if we have ever been denied entry to Canada. After this his face turned red with anger. Veins in his neck announced themselves. In a thick french Canadian accent, \""Do you think we're stupid? Do you think we don't talk to each other and do not have a description of your vehicle?\"" He then mentioned banning us from Canada for 10 years. A very bad prospect for Eric, a terrifying one for myself. \
\
Another trip through US Customs where we chatted with a friendly guy about our situation. I'm not down with being flagged. If I had done something wrong then sure, that's justice. If you're just a moron with a little too much power, well you probably won't be my best friend. I guess us supposed drug hungry climbers let them down. No reefer tarriff money from us. Much could be said here about this situation but I'm still too upset to talk about it. \
\
We drove south. The DFR was not very happy at this point. I began to  joke about stuff then gradually drifted into a depressed mood. Eric went straight there. The miles south clicked by as we considered what had happened. Disbelief."

,"accident","Oh Aaron!\
\
That is terrible man, Ive been away for so long I did not have a chance to read this report. I hope you are doing well, and will feel good enough to get back into the mountains this winter. Things like this make me feel like climbing anything alpine in nature is not worth it anymore sometimes. Climbing is fun, but the idea of the possibilites of accidents scares the heck out of me. I guess that is true with anything in life. \
\
I guess we all should take being in the mountains more seriously, Aaron can attest to this. I know that I have been a sloppy partner at times ie. getting frost bite on my feet, not drinking enough water etc etc.. the list goes on. stay safe out there!"
,"Wow, even two of Jon's Doods missed that one","Let me make this crystal clear. I was quite upset after being denied access at the Oroville crossing. By the time we reached Omak I didn't give a hoot. The point of the above post was of a much differnt nature. Maybe Gary got it. I know Eric did. [quote=&quot;I&quot;:1rev96pd] this is about what I would say had I misinterpreted your post in the manner you misread mine the other day. [/quote:1rev96pd] This is a reference to fiction work. I was upset about the manner in which we were treated. Had you been there you may understand this. A Few things: was I ignorant in Custom's policy? is this what upset me? how many times have I been through Canada customs in the past 6 months? (and does that matter?) have you, or anyone you know, heard of this happening recently? what was my point here? I have answers to all of these questions. I guess others don't but that doesn't really matter. \
\
Matt, should I be pissed at myself if someone lifted my these crucial documents? Or should I berate society and the ill effects souring my taste of the world. ... and like the weather two weekends ago, you are wrong in the last point. It IS my God given right to enter Canada. It is in fact my homeland and the body of land housing my mountains. \
\
As y'all will see in A Pair of Rejections & a Pair of Reunions: Part 1.5 and Part 3 I had a blast last weekend. Nothing usually gets me down for more than 15 minutes besides school. \
\
I read about the Exit 38 trip but failed to see anything about an Enchantments trip. How was that? Do you have any photos to post?"
,"Weird sighting in the Enchantments","I can't write a trip report because I wasn't there, but my brother gave me this picture to tell of a strange encounter he had while hiking in the Enchantments last weekend. Apparently this man-like creature came out of the lake while Norbert was eating his lunch, and startled him a bit. We consulted the literature and came to the conclusion that it must be the elusive LARCH-MAN! If anyone has ever heard of this, I'd be grateful for more beta.\

Deadline is December 5."
"little-tahoma","Little Tahoma - Fryingpan Glacier","Deciding that I still had some energy left after my Buckner trip, Nick and I went for Little Tahoma last week (Tues-Wed). We approached via the Fryingpan Creek trail, arriving in Summerland in 1.5 hours to get our first views of Little Tahoma up close. 

[url=http&#58;//outdoors&#46;webshots&#46;com/photo/2140607790103926705fshRGd:3qlkgkqj][img:3qlkgkqj]http&#58;//inlinethumb14&#46;webshots&#46;com/269/2140607790103926705S600x600Q85&#46;jpg[/img:3qlkgkqj][/url:3qlkgkqj]

We ascended easy snow slopes to Meany Crest, and continued another 100 ft up and right to the edge of the Fryingpan Glacier, where we made camp. A small bivy/tent site was found among the rocks, although it was the only one we could locate. There was running water nearby. The approach took 5 hours total. 

Meany Crest from Summerland--we ascended the snow slopes to the rocks on the upper right of this photo.

A 3 am start got us to the edge of the Whtiman Glacier by 5 am and sunrise. 
[url=http&#58;//outdoors&#46;webshots&#46;com/photo/2391527040103926705dhETcW:3qlkgkqj][img:3qlkgkqj]http&#58;//inlinethumb04&#46;webshots&#46;com/42627/2391527040103926705S600x600Q85&#46;jpg[/img:3qlkgkqj][/url:3qlkgkqj]

The traverse across both the Fryingpan and Whitman involved just a few, very large crevasses, so we opted to rope up for the ascent.   
 
At the top of the Whitman, we exited onto rocks. The scrambling was only moderate, and we found the rock to be better than expected (although that really isn't saying much given what we were expecting). Let's just say I'm glad there weren't other climbers on the route above us that day. 

Scrambling the summit blocks.

We reached the summit (11,138 ft) at 8:30 am in full sun and with the temp rising fast. We saw numerous climbers making their way up the DC and Emmons.
[url=http&#58;//outdoors&#46;webshots&#46;com/photo/2692084570103926705rUgnss:3qlkgkqj][img:3qlkgkqj]http&#58;//inlinethumb36&#46;webshots&#46;com/44131/2692084570103926705S600x600Q85&#46;jpg[/img:3qlkgkqj][/url:3qlkgkqj]

During the descent back to camp we saw at least two large rocks come rolling down the snow alongside us, and made our way quickly out of danger. With the temps as warm as they were that day, I'm glad we didn't stay on the summit too long.

Still, the snow remained firm on the glacier, making for a quick descent.  We packed up camp and were back to the car by 3 pm. 

This was an excellent trip and I'm surprised it doesn't see more ascents (maybe 1 group/week according to the summit register). The approach and climb are very straightforward, and as long as you avoid the rocks on warm days I think you shouldn't have any problems.  

[b:3qlkgkqj]Gear Notes:[/b:3qlkgkqj]
8 mm x 30 m glacier rope
We brought slings for a possible rappel, although we just ended up easily downclimbing the scramble route.  
Crampons, ice axe, crevasse rescue gear.

[b:3qlkgkqj]Approach Notes:[/b:3qlkgkqj]
The trail to Summerland is in excellent condition and snow free.  

There seemed to be many campsites on top of Meany Crest, so stay left at the top of the snowfields and find a spot up there."
"leavenworth-area-climbs","TR:  Leavenworth cragging","Elain and I went cragging at Leavenworth on Saturday, with a friend (Bruce).  It was the first time Elain and I had gone cragging at Leavenworth.  Temperatures were in the high 30s and there were no other climbers around.  We climbed two different cracks at at \""Barney's Rubble\"" and about six lines at \""Roto Wall\"".  Bruce showed us some crack climbing techniques, hand jams and fist jams and that sort of thing.  Elain and I enjoyed all the lines we climbed, except the bolted friction slab on the right-hand side of \""Roto Wall\"
"mount-baker","Coleman Glacier Ice Playground - Nov. 1","It was a smashing (yes) success! \
\
A large, shivering crowd met at the Burke parking lot at 6:30am on Saturday, bleary-eyed from Halloween partying but full of enthusiasm. More people showed up than the organizers had anticipated, which was great - the club is sweet stuff this year! Unfortunately we lost a few folks soon afterwards. They got into a Volvo station wagon and were never seen again. We had agreed to reconvene at the Glacier ranger station, but after an hour's waiting for the Volvo we gave up, left a note with the rangers on how to find us, and set out for the glacier. \
On the drive up we could see Baker in all its frozen splendor, and severe drooling ensued (some of us had been entertaining plans of climbing it the next day, and I was kicking myself for not bringing gear). \

\
The hike to the Colemann Glacier overlook turned out to be quite the alpine adventure. You have to cross several glacial streams on the way, and thanks to the cold temperatures they were mostly frozen over. \
\
[img:3cbkies8]http&#58;//staff&#46;washington&#46;edu/jgust/Photos/Climbing/frzcreek&#46;JPG[/img:3cbkies8]\
\
After lots of waffling and slipping we finally encouraged everyone to put on crampons for the stream crossings. That was pretty funny, but saved a lot of time. \
Still, it was noon by the time we set foot on the glacier. We separated into groups - the more experienced people set out to find gnarly crevasses for toproping, and the glacier novices took a short course in basic crampon technique. Soon everyone was whacking away at the ice though, with implements ranging from lightweight aluminum axes to actual ice tools (ice tools worked better). We had four topropes on crevasse walls ranging from mellow to vertical: \

\
All the while, I kept looking for the Volvo crowd, but they never showed up. I feel really sorry for you guys - please let us know what happened.\
The weather had started out cold and clear, but soon turned to cold and snowy. That did not deter us, everyone was having a blast. Ryan even took an axe to his forehead and created a deep flesh wound. He was fine after some bandaging, but this reminds us to make sure the helmet covers the forehead, eh. \
We stretched out our limited time on the glacier until it started getting dark. On the way back, more than one ungraceful thud rang through the wintry air as people slipped on snow-disguised ice that covered the trail in many places. \
We celebrated the day with dinner at Molina's in Glacier, where they threw their awesome homemade bread down a bottomless hole (aka UW climbers) and fed us creamy, noodly concoctions. Ryan and his girlz didn't stay because he wanted to get his head checked out - I hope that went well. \
\
To sum it up, an excellent trip, and fun was had by all!! Thank y'all for making it such a success and keeping it relatively safe.

Oh, I almost forgot to mention another confusing encounter some of us had. There seem to be more human-like creatures lurking around the Cascades than one would think. This one came out of a crevasse: \

"index","Ralph and Dan's badass day at Index","This trip consisted mostly of eating a really big breakfast at the Varsity Inn (on 35th) yesterday. I think Ralph got the blueberry pancake combo, and I had a spinach and cheese omelette. Yumm! Then we drove to Index, taking our time because the weather was supposed to be sketchy. \
\
We almost had the place to ourselves, so we aimed straight for the plum, City Park. Some people say it's 5.14a, but we were pretty sure 5.13c was more like it. The idea of a free ascent was vetoed because of the crack's total lack of aesthetic purity - that thing was nailed into submission probably 20 years ago! Ok, we were there to aid climb. Ralph started digging into the mountains of gear we had brought.  He then aided up while I belayed, thinking about the simpler things in life while slooooooooowly feeding out rope: the texture of a fern, or how bigleaf maple can have both monopodial and branched growth patterns, or how if I had a Grigri, I could pretty much have a nap, have lunch or really give my bum a good scratching. Note to self: next time aid climbing, beg/borrow/steal a Grigri.... After one short but hard fall (why you clip the rope into a piece after testing it!) and two hours or so, he was on top! I somewhat more quickly jugged up and cleaned, noting how aid climbing is pretty scary. \
\
We got the hell out of there before it got dark."
,"concerning the volvo group","I was sleeping most of the way up in the volvo and i didn't hear the specific directions, but our group never stopped at a ranger station,  we just drove on that main road for like 20 miles past the right turn.  We eventually asked some rangers and we found the right turn.  We went on that unpaved/paved road for a bit, then took at right at the #36 sign.  Our group was under the impression that we were supposed to be looking for exit thrity six the whole time, and that is why we missed the original turnout.  Anyways we took #36 for a long way( maybe five miles), on unpaved windy roads that went away from baker.  Eventually we reached a dead end and turned around all the way back to the #36 fork.  We took the other way at the fork this time and ended up at the right parking lot.  It's now like 11:30.  We recognized your cars and so began hiking the trail. After about 1.5 hours we reached a fork in the trail, one way went to Glacier view and the other was the climbing trail. We tried the glacier view trail, but were stopped by a rushing river surrounded by ice.   It looked pretty dangerous so we went back and up to the climbers trail.  We took this for about 20 minutes, and got some great views of the glacier and which time we spotted you guys a few miles off in the distance.  I guess you guys took the glacier view trail.  It was already about 2:30, and it would have taken a few hours to get where you guys were, so we called it a day, hiked back down and drove home.  Got to UW at about 7:30.  The day wasn't a total wash, we got some good hiking in, but it would have been fun to ice climb. Maybe next time.  Are your guys planning another ice climbing trip anytime soon?"
"Mount-constance","sick ice in the Olympics","Hiked Saturday in the vicinity of Constance chasing after a rumor of some ice. It was cold, and beautiful, but unfortunately the route we were heading for was dry. Just not enough snow up there yet to get that freeze/thaw thing going. Did find a short little stream/waterfall that had frozen, so we got to swing our tools a bit. Damn that feels good! We got the FA on-sight, free solo! I would Give it Grade I-, WI1, M1, FM1! For those that are unfamiliar, FM stands for frozen moss, a distinct but similar grading to the VD (Vertical Dirt) system. We even got a nice little snow shower while we were bashing around up there. Winter is on its way!!!\

"bean-peak","Bean Peak in the Teanaways","I took the whole herd (Lisa, Brooke, our nephew Stefan, Holly and Cedar) out to the Teanaways to climb Bean Peak on Friday.  It was an amazingly clear, sunny day and we did not see another person till we were half way back to the car - ahhh solitude, kind of.  We went up via Beverly Creek/4th Creek/County Line trail to Volcanic Neck.  At this point our original plan was to head out to Devil's Head, but with out a implement of balance I was not comfortable carrying Brooke on the traverse below Volcanic Neck, so we elected for a scramble of Bean.  Evidently we waited too long to change Brooke as on the summit of Bean she decided to help cool me off by wetting my shirt/shorts - the joys of parenthood.  This was Brooke's second trip out and is proving to be quite effective training weight for J-Berg as she is now up to about 12-13lbs.  To say the least my shoulders we pretty sore when we got back to the car.

On a more somber note, Cedar managed to tear up her front pads pretty bad on the trip.  We first noticed something was wrong when she became a very reluctant hiker for the last couple of miles back to the car.  I'm not sure if it was the heat of the rocks or the abrasiveness of them, but ever since I have been carrying her in and out of the house as she is only up for walking a few feet at a time.  So a word of caution for anyone planning on taking any four legged hiking partners into this area.

Trail Notes: The Bean creek crossing near Beverly Creek is trivial now and there is very little snow left in the area.

\
Other ratings of note for this route:\
Approach- RC 1-, LJ 2, FOD 2+, BW 1\
For explanations, see glossary at end.\
\
Short version:  Jule and I seized the window of good conditions on Thursday and Friday Nov 6-7 to climb Eldo.  Much like our heroes in The Eiger Sanction, we were a German-American international team, we decided to ascend a contrived north-facing route with lots of ice, and we used primitive rope techniques.  Unlike the movie, however, the route conditions were excellent, the weather was favorable, our anchors held, and we didn’t have any French sissies on our team.\
\
Long version:  Jule and I arrived at the road closure late morning Thursday on Old Cascade Rd., pleased to be the only registered climbers in the park.  Two Spaniards had climbed the East Ridge of Eldo the previous day.  There were two washouts on OCR, but both were easily passed.\
\
We began hiking just before noon, and crossed the Cascade River barefoot before finding the approach trail.  Jule hiked up in her plastic boots, I carried mine in my backpack and hiked in approach shoes.  The trail was in good shape with patches of ice.  Jule found a touk, presumably lost by one of the Spaniards.\
\
The approach was varied, involving the trail, lots of talus, iced up stream crossings, scrambling, and snow-covered rock.  We took our time and reached the foot of the Inspiration Glacier at sunset.  The temp dropped and we set up camp on some rocks.  Jule warmed up inside her sleeping bag as I made dinner, and we bivvied on the rock and snow.  The air temp dropped to 14 degrees, but we stayed warm and rose at 3:30 to begin our ascent.\
\
The glacier was easy to climb, but up on the ice cap the temp dropped to the single digits.  Crevasses were gaping but the snow bridges were frozen.  At the notch at the base of the east ridge we took a break, deciding to skip the NW couloir.  I had discovered that I left a fair amount of important gear in the truck:  biners, runners, lockers, and belay device.  We had enough screws to climb the couloir, but not enough runners.\
\
We traversed out onto the NE face, scoped out a line, and I began to lead up.  Some ice covered rock led to a steeper face and headwall.  I made an anchor at the base of the headwall and belayed Jule up on a munter, a technique that would have impressed even Clint Eastwood.  The headwall was a steeper step of 70 degree ice.  From the anchor I led up eight feet or so, sank a bomber screw in the best ice on the route, and only stopped to place one more screw above the step.\
\
At the next belay I was tired, and annoyed at myself for leaving gear behind that would have made life easier.  As it was I hung on an anchor of three screws, three biners, and three runners, two of which were girth-hitched to my harness, and I had to belay Jule up with the munter off two non-lockers.  Minus five style points for Nick.  Jule enjoyed the steep step, and gleefully continued onwards up the 50 degree ice.\
\
A brief stroll took us onto the shoulder of the ridge where we stopped for a break in the sun.  Jule untied and sauntered the final five minutes to the summit, and I followed her shortly after.  The views were spectacular.  The summit of Eldorado has to be one of the most aesthetic in the range.\
\
Downclimbing the east ridge was easy, or “doigts dans le nez,” as we say in French (so easy you can do it while picking your nose).  Descending the Inspiration in the daylight we saw our ascending tracks came a little too close to the edge of some of the overhung crevasse edges, so we wove through with wider berths.  Pressure was dropping and a bank of clouds was moving in on the horizon, so we were glad to be on our way down.\
\
The hike back to the road felt really long.  The FrozOn Dirt of the approach had turned to squelchy mud, and there was some large rockfall on the road around mile 8.  We sat before the artificial fireplace at Good Food drinking milkshakes and eating onion rings, mmmmmmm.  We narrowly avoided death on 530 when a suicidal driver pulled out right in front of us, but disaster was averted.  \
\
The route was a fun climb.  Although the route we chose was a bit contrived, it was interesting enough to be a worthwhile endeavor if you want something between a walkup and a committing couloir ice climb.  You can make it as hard or easy as you want.  \
\
Good veather, bad veather, now or later, anytime is good for klimbingk.\

,"Ralph revisits City Park","I tried aid climbing.  Ralph patiently belayed, then jugged up after me while I enjoyed the beautiful view.\

Aid is scary.  I don't know why, since I trust my gear on trad lead, but somehow hanging on it is scary.  I'm not sure I liked it.  I think I'll have to try it again to find out.\

,"Nevermind at Exit 38, Nov. 8","I dragged my girlfriend to Nevermind at Exit 38 on Saturday.  It was a lot warmer than the weekend before when Mike and I were there, and everything was totally dry (no falling ice bombs).  We warmed up (sort of - my fingers only went partially numb instead of fully like last week) on Neverigine, and then I sent Culture Shock.  My girlfriend didn't want to climb because it was too cold for her, and since I had told her the reason I wanted to go was to do that climb, we had to leave after that.  But it wasn't really that cold, and I would have liked to have stayed and climbed more.  Oh well."
"ruth-mountain","Mt. Ruth TR","This past Saturday, Jim and I left Seattle early to climb Mt. Ruth.  Three hours later we were at the trailhead making last minute checks of gear and clothes.  The road to Ruth is still passable although there is a rock slide that's covering part of the road about 1 mi from the trailhead; however, my Honda Accord made it over so it shouldn't be a problem.  We hiked up the valley with cloudy skies overhead,  cold temps, and frozen patchs on the trail. Many of the waterfalls in the valley were frozen too.  \
\
We reached Hannagan Pass in under two hours and turned towards the climbers trail, which ascended the frozen mud slopes.  There was a dusting of new snow, but the trail was still easy to follow.  A short while later we donned our crampons and headed up the glacier towards the summit.  We moved toward the (climber's) left of the large block.  The glacier was mostly ice with several open crevasses but easily avoidable.  Soon we were standing on the summit.  By this point the clouds had all but cleared, and we were treated to stunning views of Shuksan, Baker and the Picketts.  We spent a long time on the summit eating and enjoying the view before heading down.  The return trip was uneventful, although due to the sunshine the frozen mud was not quite so frozen, which just added to the excitement of the descent.  Just as the last rays of light were disappearing from view we returned to the parking lot.  \
\
All in all a fun climb.  I'd love to go back to bivy at the summit and climb Icy as well.  I highly recommend this area for those who haven't been (and even those who have)!"

###############################################################\
Inner Constance, 22/23 June 2002\
\
Although I have climbed numerous routes on Mt. Constance over the years, I've never tried anything on Inner Constance (\""InnerC\""). So I put InnerC on the schedule, and lo and behold Bruce, Nathan and Brian agreed to go with me.\
\
\""What is so inner about Inner Constance?\"" Bruce mused. \
\
You know, I don't know. Most mountain structures with distinct multiple peaks generally have blander names along the usual geographic theme: North and South Brother, for example, or West and East Peaks of Mt. Olympus (which also has a Middle Peak.) Closer to Constance there is Mt. Buckhorn, with its Southwest and Northeast peaks, or conversely Warrior Peak, with its Southeast and Northwest peaks.  \
\
So why Inner? Would that not imply an \""Outer Constance\""?  No such place exists. The name Inner Constance is strangely evocative.  It sounds like \""inner sanctum\"

,"Dan and Ralph play in the snow","Dan and I went to Snoqualmie Pass Sunday afternoon for what we expected to be some character-building, wet slogging.  Our plans changed on the way, from Granite Mountain to Snow Lake, and it was this fortuitous decision that tossed us into the hilarious company of Washington's clueless drivers struggling to negotiate the snow near the pass.  Trucks were splayed across all lanes at the summit, but Dan's yuppie wagon was sendin', not pretendin'.\
\
The trail was perfect!  Just enough snow to give us that wintry feeling and keep our boots steadily plodding.  Snowflakes were falling all the while and deepening our steps as we switchbacked up to the Snow Lake overlook.  We found a snug two-man shelter under a snow-bent sapling and snacked.  Suddenly a dark patch appeared below us -- the lake!  To our right was the benign west side of Snoqualmie, whose north side we briefly entertained seeking to goggle at.\
\
It was 3 o'clock by now, but we were unsatisfied, so we started scouting the approach to Chair Peak.  After a few yards of postholing through trees, we gave it up for a series of deep powder glissades connecting the switchbacks.\
\
Lookin' nice and frosty up there!  We even saw a few knuckledraggers lugging their boards around, presumably in search of a slope to carve some freshiez on."
,"Baker skiing","Since Baker (the lifts, that is) opened on Thurs with a 50-60\"" snow base, we went skiing on Friday.  Jeremy and Kevin and I drove up together; we saw Jule and her brother there, too.\
\
The resort posted their conditions as \""packed powder\"".  Having learned to ski in Utah, I thought most of the runs were kind of icy, although there certainly were a few good runs.  The best run was the Canyon with a field of fresh powder leading to a narrow chute of non-icy but packed snow.  Whee!  They said it was experts only, but I thought it was fine, so I think Baker's definition of \""expert\"" is a bit soft.  Then again, I haven't been resort skiing for ages.\
\
Speaking of which, does anyone else think that half of Baker's blue runs are really as easy as greens?  And half their blacks are as easy as blues?"
"The-tooth","Belitz-Gratz Flailure at Alpental, Part XXIV","Yeah...I know. \
\
Eric and I set off from the parking lot to 'climb' the NE slab of Da TOOF. Yeah, we're cool. The snow cover on the (summer) trail was thin, so I had to carry my skis. We got above Source Lake, booted up the gully (which was nasty in places, very deep powder over hard crust), and got into the basin. I ditched my skis, and we followed two other climbers over to the route. When we caught up we realized the two others were Steve and Elain Ramsey, nice to meet you guys at last! The last 30 feet to rock were very 'fun'. Crotch and waist-deep powder at 40 degrees. Eric and I managed to wallow up it in half an hour, using my shovel to literally dig a path. We hit rock just after Steve, and we collectively decided that half an inch of aerated ice poorly bonded to rock was NOT our thing, so we bailed. We're getting altogether too good at failing by now. \
\
There was a circus at the bolted mixed routes, with at least ten people milling about. I got some enjoyable rocks...um...turns in the gully. Once we hit the ice slab at the base of the gully, the skis came off, and we bouldered around on thin, wet, sometimes rotten ice. I was happy that my AT boots climb steep ice better than my leathers! \
\
We then hiked out past the hordes of snowshoers, and drove home, despite the obnoxious football traffic. At least we managed to stay on the trail this time! But we are still so suck."
,"Snowy mixed fun at Alpental","On Sunday Ryan, Marcie and I headed up to Alpental to go swim in the snow and hopefully find the fabled crag of bolted mixed routes.  It was a success!  Things got off to a great start when Marcie found a tooque at the trailhead, and we hiked along the summer trail in a nice trough packed hard by snowshoers.  Nearly an hour and a half later we arrived at the crag.  It was hard to see very far on account of the snow and cloud we were inside, but we found the spot.\
\
After gaping at some sick overhung routes in disbelief we tossed our packs beneath a roof and geared up for the easiest routes there.  I belayed Ryan as he led one of the M7 pitches in unflappable style.  Climbing scary bolted routes with double ropes provided an added safety margin, as Ryan could reach high to make clips with one rope without extending his other rope.  Why didn't we think of this before?  Ryan took one hang off the last bolt, where there was a rather thin and dicey sequence, compounded by the fact that Ryan could see no bolts or chains in the snow above the roof.  Once located, however, he pulled the crux and was soon back down on the snow.\
\
Marcie and I each toproped the route, and also hung at the last bolt.  Having the tall cheater reach was a small advantage, but the moves getting up to that point were interesting.  There was not much ice on the wall, but there were thin lenses (1-2cm) of soft ice forming on the lips of sloping edges, and they held delicate hooks.  There was a fair amount of drytool placements, and a short sequence of barehanded rock moves (or rather bare-gloved).\
\
On his second trip up, Ryan placed a directional so we could climb the other M7 that was next door (and scored a booty biner).  It had less ice on it and was more challenging.  It is a little harder to drytool slopers.\
\
Two other climbers showed up and worked on a steep face that had a fixed rope hung off it.  They were going to continue up to the Tooth, but ended up returning to their car after a while.  We looked at their route, and decided we would not try to climb it so the ice could form on it, but really we were just tired from pulling hard and holding body tension.\
\
It was a good outing, interesting to reprogram the brain to control the body differently.  The crag had good rock and the bolts were solid and close.  After recovering from the Screaming Barfies while hanging 35 feet off the ground in the swirling snow and pulling the crux roof moves, I realized \""This is kind of like having fun, only different.\"","",""0"
"index","aiding Thin Fingers at Index","Ania and I went to Index on Sunday to practice aiding.  \
\
I aided up the first (approach) pitch, as I was feeling lazy and not warmed up in the morning.  Then Ania played around with cam hooks and sky hooks on top rope.  We both then free-climbed the pitch on top-rope.  Index gave me the solid ass-whooping that it's so well-known for.  Despite having led the first pitch back in summer without a problem, I fell at two different places along the pitch while on top-rope.  Thank you Index, may I have another?  \
\
After lunch, we jugged up to the ledge at the top of the first pitch, and then Ania led the second pitch.  By then, we were in the shade and it was pretty breezy.  Despite wearing a fleece jacket, goretex jacket/pants, and Ania's jacket, I was noticing how chilly it was during the belay.  After Ania finished, I decided I'd take a stab at freeing the route.  I gave Ania her jacket back and discovered how much warmer it is once you're moving around just a little.  But still when I got to the handcrack and felt the cold rock numbing my hands on each jam, I decided that it just wasn't enjoyable and I'll return on a warmer day.\
\
Aid lesson of the day: if you think you're ready to transfer from aid to free, do one more aid move first."
,"Snowshoeing Around Snoqualmie Pass","I've been up to Snoqualmie Pass for the last two weekends doing some fairly benign snowshoeing.  Just out of curiousity, is this the right way to spell snowshoeing?  Jule?\
\
At any rate, the biggest problem seems to be finding a trailhead (or other suitable departure point) that hasn't been overrun by snowmobilers or doesn't require a snow-cat to reach.  Perhaps it's time I learned how to cross-country ski.  But I digress...\
\
The first weekend, I headed out to Annette Lake with Jen and Andrew.   After going through plans A,B, and C without finding an open trailhead, we hit gold with plan D (Annette Lake) which allowed us to avoid reverting to Plan E (Granite Peak) or Plan F (Mailbox Peak).  I imagine this trail looks somewhat overused in the summer, but after two feet of fresh snow, the forest seemed to be back in pristine order.  Didn't really need the snowshoes on the trail, but they came in handy when we started plowing our way up the side of Silver Peak.  The climb was straightforward, but strenuous, and all three of us (or at least me) had forgotten that it's harder to make good time in snowshoes than in boots.  As clear views gave way to a white out and the cliff bar in my pack turned to a block of ice, we decided we'd had enough and turned around somewhere on the side of Silver Peak and slid back down the slopes to the lake (I have the GPS waypoint stashed if anyone's really curious).  We made it back to North Bend and stopped at \""The Pizza Place\"" (strongly recommended by all) and caught the final 15 minutes of the Apple Cup.  Solid end to a really fun day (unless you're a WSU fan).\
\
Last weekend, I headed out on the Gold Creek trail with my next door neighbor, illustrious mathematician, and in no way affiliated with the climbing club - Marty.  The trail is *really* benign, but the postholes appeared out to get Marty, who despite weighing considerably less than me, kept punching through.  The area was rather pretty and the trail easy to follow until we completely, and abruptly, lost it in a marshy area.  Contemplating crossing an unknown amount of snow covered water, we decided to turn back and reached the car in good order (and additional 20-30 postholes by Marty.  I was really feeling sorry for him by the end).  Hardly needed our snowshoes, since the trail was packed so solid (at least for me).  Did get quite a kick out of the folks who stopped us along the way asking, \""Does this trail make a loop, or just keep going?\""  Despite an urge to send them bushwhacking towards the PCT, I gave them the real answer.\
\
Bottom line is that you don't really need snowshoes to go hiking in the winter if you're on the more frequented trails.  (unless you're Marty)  Snoqualmie Pass, which I don't usually like to visit in the summer, is actually rather pretty with a lot of snow and doesn't require a burly SUV to access.  (one can, of course, argue that burly SUV's aren't truly necessary to reach any trailhead)  So go out and hike!"
"Dirtyface-peak","Dirtyface Peak","Ralph and I made the long drive out to the chiwawa river rd north of Leavenworth yesterday to find that the road is only open to snowmobilers, dogsledders, and skiiers.  So we drove a little further north past Lake Wenatchee to the Dirtyface Peak trailhead.  It was well above freezing and sunny, making the snowshoeing through increasingly deeper snow pretty wet and tiring.  Turned around about 5000 ft. after we had achieved Ralph's goal of going on a \""snow slog.\""  Had some great views, marveled at the tracks of some adventurous animals, and had a good time all by ourselves out in the snowy wilderness."
"Foggy-peak","Foggy Peak - 6/28/09","Having (apparently) not had quite enough of Foggy Peak last fall, Chris and I re-teamed to climb Foggy Peak on Sunday and traded Todd and Craig for Ethan. I haven't seen the pictures yet, but I believe this to be a good deal.

Our day started with a quad burning bike ride in to Monte Cristo. Every year the road gets a little worse, but it's still definitely worth bringing the bikes for the ride out. Once someone comes through with a chain saw and clears out a few downed trees (or builds some sweet jumps) life will be better.

As per last fall's TR, the route follows the Glacier Basin trail, then drops off and crosses the creek where the train bends into Glacier Basin proper. Presently, there is a great deal of snow in in the basin, which facilitates travel. Unfortunately, it's sounding a bit hollow in places and Chris was able to locate a particularly weak pocket. On the other side, we climbed steep duff for a bit and then mellow tread to ~4800'. Here, the forested rib comes to a cliffy end and we crossed a small stream, then thrashed through less than 100 yards of slide alder to emerge on a snow covered talus field. Or rather, that's what we should have done. My memory was not so good and we went up, then back down through the alder, which did result in Chris standing directly above Ethan, supported only by greenery.

Once on the talus, the going was easy, if a little loose in places, to the bottom of the wide gully splitting the south face of Foggy. Beckey suggests ascending an indistinct gully (so indistinct, in fact, that it doesn't look like a gully from below) to a notch west of the summit block. The final pitch is class 4 and quite solid. We can't speak to this, as we ended up ignoring/failing to comprehend Fred's suggested route. We exited the snow gully over a bit of a schrund, removed crampons, and scrambled up. In short order, we located Craig's cordalette, which had been marooned on our previous trip. From here we traversed to a heathery bench, where Chris decided that the exposure and scrambling were not quite what he had in mind for the rest of the afternoon. We respected his decision, expect when Ethan trundled a rock on him from higher up. I, too, trundled a few rocks, but shouted &quot;rock&quot; as a courtesy.

The scrambling suggested by Fred seems quite straightforward, based on our descent. However, Ethan and I took a somewhat less standard route on the way up (and considering how often Foggy is climbed, my guess is that it's really non-standard). Easy (and less easy) scrambling brought us to the bottom of a heathery ramp where we roped up. I led out, first trying to climb the rock next to the heather, but finding it so well &quot;fractured&quot; that the heather was vastly preferable. Two marginal nuts and a cam later, my route dead-ended at a fairly pleasant alcove directly to the east of the summit ridge (i.e., the wrong side of the mountain). Here, I belayed Ethan up. He was not particularly happy that the bleached sling I had clipped in to was nearly chewed through in two places, but I put his fears to rest by demonstrating the the rock it was slung around had quite a bit of play to it (think a poor man's Yate's Screamer). I think the cam and nut backing it up (or being backed up by them) were less suspect, but Ethan didn't fall and we didn't have to find out. The &quot;pitch&quot; was slightly more than half a rope length and no worse than 4th class.

Leaving a somewhat discomfited Ethan behind, I led out through a short, blocky dihedral and flopped up on to the ridge to find some truly delightful climbing in front of me, rather reminiscent of the best part of the East Ridge of N. Ingalls. Fun hand crack, great foot jams (so good, in fact, that my feet got stuck for an unfortunate moment), and solid opportunities for protection (5.0ish). Upon reaching the summit proper, I slung a very large block and belayed Ethan up. His mood improved considerably the moment he was on the ridge and surrounded by the Monte Cristo Peaks. Sloan loomed to the north and Glacier was extremely striking in the distance. The camera also came out.

We recharged for a bit on the summit, signed into the film can summit register (hats off to the fellow who solo'd the route in '06) and then made preparations to rap down. Not particularly interested in descending the way we had come, we rapped along what we hoped was the proper ascent route. I think we were not quite far enough to the west as we had to do one rap and then a second length of awkward downclimbing on rappel from a slightly suspect horn. From here, easy 3rd class took us back to Chris. The very bottom was a little slabby, wet, and not-entirely-pleasant (hence our earlier routefinding misadventures), but preferable to our ascent route. From here, we rapped back down the wet slabs to the snowfield and reversed our route. Craig's cordalette remains a permanent fixture on the route. 

Descent went off without a hitch and we were back to the bikes by 8:45 and the car at Barlow at 9:30. Long day, but a great time in the mountains with a solid pair of partners. Looking forward to the photographic interpretation of the climb."
,"Skiing Steven's Pass, losing a skiier","Five of us went back-country skiing on the north side of Heather Ridge, across the street from the Steven's Pass ski area. The trip turned into an adventure, so I'm splitting this into a trip description and an analysis.\
\
Trip Report:\
\
Since Matt was in town, we had to go back-country skiing. If you knew Matt, this would be obvious. Lots of snow has been coming down and the snowpack was unstable, so we decided to ski on terrain that was not avalanche prone.  See <!-- m --><a class=\""postlink\"" href=\""http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/ania/HeatherRidge_Dec03/weather.txt\"">http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/ania ... eather.txt</a><!-- m --> for weather and avalanche forecasts for Sunday.\
\
The five of us (Matt, Russ, Bruce, Mark, and I) started skinning up from the highway around 8:30 in the morning. We broke trail to the top of the ridge and a little down the back side. Breaking trail was hard work, with the leader continually sinking to his knees, but hey, the three guys needed a workout. <!-- s:) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\"" alt=\"":)\"" title=\""Smile\"" /><!-- s:) --> I was feeling lazy and avoided the front of the line. Mark had had surgery about 6 weeks ago and although cleared by his doctor to go skiing, was still recovering and getting back into shape after a break from exercising. We descended a little ways down the back side and stopped. We talked about how digging nine snow pits in the same hillside you'll get nine different results, then dug a pit. The top 8 inches would slide easily but the snow was fairly consolidated beneath that. We took off our skins and did a first run, gingerly, one at a time, through the trees, keeping each other in sight as well as possible. As the day went on and the snow conditions remained consistent with our pit observations, we skiied more bravely. We got in about 6 fabulous runs (all starting at the same point) in knee-deep powder. We were the only people on that hillside and all the snow was fresh.\
\
After the last run, we regrouped at the top of the run, then headed back up to the crest of the ridge following our morning tracks. Since we had been the only people to ski there since the last copious snowfall, the two-foot deep path was clear. When we stopped to regroup again some 3/4 of the way up, Mark was not with us. Matt skiied back down to the top of our ski run (where we had last seen Mark), but Mark was not there. Matt skiied back up and the four of us had a brief conference. Matt and Russ would go look for Mark; Bruce and I would ski down to warn ski patrol that a rescue might be in order if Matt and Russ weren't successful in their search. Bruce and I handed over all our food, water, and spare clothes (which wasn't much). I also gave Matt my shovel.\
\
Bruce and Ania's story: The ski down was more fantastic powder. We got down quickly and uneventfully, dropped our gear at the car, and went to talk to ski patrol. We told them we had a missing person but that it made sense to give Russ and Matt 1-2 hours to search for Mark before sending in anyone else. The area we had been skiing was out of the area of responsibility for the ski area's ski patrol, plus they had a couple other people missing in their backcountry. They said King County Search and Rescue would be the ones to call, and since it could take them hours to arrive, they should be notified right away. Then Bruce and I sat around for three hours twiddling our thumbs. We got some food and I was about to take a nap, knowing that SAR might ask us to go back out with them to point out where we had last seen Mark (one of the ski patrollers also pointed this out as a possibility).\
\
Matt and Russ's story: Matt and Russ skiied down to the top of our run. No Mark. They skiied the run. No Mark. They skiied back to the top of the run. Russ said \""hey, there was something strange over there\"" and headed to where he had seen but overlooked a trail going off. Since we had been the only group on this hillside, it had to be Mark's trail. So Matt and Russ followed the tracks north (directly away from our return path) until they found Mark. At this point rather than retracing their steps, it was shorter to continue down the valley and north, and then east along the Pacific Crest Trail to the road.  They eventually came out on a road and asked a local homeowner to use their phone. Mark had downhill skiis with inserts that clipped into the bindings to free the heel for skinning uphill. It is much slower to switch between uphill and downhill with this setup, so the hilly nature of their route out combined with his equipment added some 45 minutes.\
\
Mark's story: Mark had not skiied the last run with us. When we regrouped at the end, by the time he had put together his skis for uphill skiing, the four of us were out of sight. He wasn't familiar with the area and didn't have a map. His impression had been that we had come from a different direction and thus headed off the wrong way.\
\
Some three hours passed between the initial conference when Matt&Russ split off from Ania&Bruce, until Russ's phone call that they were back out.\
\
Analysis:\
What the group did\
\
The fundamental error here was that we left Mark behind. It's always best to stay together.\
\
This group has hiked together before and has a history of everyone hiking at their own pace, then regrouping at the summit or trailhead or every half hour or so. On obvious trails than any individual among us would be comfortable hiking alone, this works well. In this situation, the group should have noted that the lack of a clear trail, Mark recovering from surgery, unfamiliarity with the terrain (true for all but Russ), and the backcountry nature of the trip made splitting up like this unwise.\
\
Once we realized Mark was lost, however, I believe we did the right things. Russ is familiar with the area, and also had a map and compass. Matt is experienced in the mountains and possibly the strongest member of our party. Both were warm, hydrated, thinking clearly, and capable of returning to the road themselves and possibly spending the night out with Mark if necessary. They were a good pair to send looking for Mark. In case they failed to find Mark, a search and rescue would be necessary so we needed someone to go back. Sending two people back (me and Bruce) was safer than a single individual.\
\
Lastly, each member should have had a map and compass, the knowledge to use them, and the knowledge where we were going.\
\
What the lost person did\
\
Given our tradition of hiking and regrouping, Mark should have made more clear to us that on this trip the default would not be sufficiently accommodating for him. Communication was lacking.\
\
Once lost, Mark should have stayed put. Had he waited at the top of our run, Matt would have found him on his first ski down and the entire adventure would have been shortened by 3 hours.\
\
Paying attention is also critical. Since we had been the only party on that hillside, following our own trail out was the most rational way to get back. Breaking trail (as Mark did) was not the right choice. I personally believe even novice hikers should do their best to keep a mental picture of the terrain and route, rather than fully relying on more experienced partners. What if the experienced person gets injured?\
\
Avalanche Danger\
\
All five of us were aware of the considerable avalanche danger on Sunday and assumed the risk of going out there. We took the reasonable precautions of skiing the safest terrain we could. Matt, Russ, and Bruce all participated in digging the pit; I came down a few minutes later and did my own analysis. We skiied carefully at first to get a better sense of how the snow was actually behaving. We skiied among trees and never on open slopes the entire day. There was a risk; we assessed it as best we could; we chose the safest way of skiing that we could that day. Not all of us had avalanche beacons, shovels, and probes, however."
"Mount-rainier","Camp Muir (Dec 18)","Ooh, it sure was nice. Norbert, Daniel, and I took advantage of a window of beautiful weather to ski up to Muir yesterday. We had to go there and nowhere else because Norbert needed to break into the 10,000 foot zone before he went back to Germany. \
\
Little did we know of the trouble that awaited us when we set out in 70 degree (that's what it felt like) sunshiney weather. It was balmy all the way up onto the top of Panorama Point, where you're normally pummeled by hurricane winds loaded with ice particles even on the best of days. Instead, we wore T-shirts and beads of sweat. Daniel was, quite heroically, lugging his downhill skis up on his back. \
\
When we were already within view of the huts at Camp Muir, Norbert felt tired and wanted to turn around. I told him to suck it up and finish the last couple hundred feet. That was a bad idea, because as soon as we sat down by the hut, he turned kinda green and his head started spinning. What a sight! No time for lunch, we had to get the victim down at once. \
The topmost 1500 feet were sweet skiing on packed powder, then things deteriorated and we slalomed and sitzmarked among the rocks and sheets of ice. Every so often we had to stop so Norbert could throw up, poor guy. \
\
We had gotten a late start in the morning, and progress down was slow, so we were treated to a blazing sunset from the top of Pan Point. It was sad to see the sun leave, because now the slushy corn we had been looking forward to quickly got an icy breakable crust on top, not so easy for skiing. I witnessed some spectacular crashes. Ah well, we survived. Norbert won't be visiting the Death Zone so soon again. \

"buckner-mountain","Buckner- North Face","Hayley and I climbed the North Face of Buckner last weekend in serendipitously perfect conditions. This was our fourth annual Sister’s Trip: a tradition that we hope to keep even while Hayley is attending Hopkins starting this fall.

Our first bit of luck came during the drive in. I had called two days prior to find that the gate was still closed at Eldorado creek TH. Planning on a road hike that night, happy shrieks filled the car when we found the gate open. Instead of another road slog, we booked it up to Cascade Pass arriving just after midnight and promptly fell asleep in our bivies. We awoke to this:

We earned ourselves a more leisurely start after our night hike and started up to Sahale Arm at 7am.

Our first task of this long route was to climb up and over Sahale. Since we were carrying heavy overnight packs and were climbing in plastic boots we chose to pitch out and protect the climb of the summit block of Sahale. By 11am we were on the summit.

We got our first view of the north face (left of Ripsaw ridge).

The next part of the trip involved getting over to the Boston Glacier. We rapped off of the other side of Sahale and carefully descended the corniced ridge towards the Boston-Sahale col.
[url=http&#58;//outdoors&#46;webshots&#46;com/photo/2240713510101779210RFLgPF:1czn71uw][img:1czn71uw]http&#58;//inlinethumb04&#46;webshots&#46;com/43139/2240713510101779210S600x600Q85&#46;jpg[/img:1czn71uw][/url:1czn71uw] [url=http&#58;//outdoors&#46;webshots&#46;com/photo/2509844990103926705IjFoCB:1czn71uw][img:1czn71uw]http&#58;//inlinethumb45&#46;webshots&#46;com/1132/2509844990103926705S600x600Q85&#46;jpg[/img:1czn71uw][/url:1czn71uw]

At the col we met another team of two (also climbing the NF of Buckner) that we would end up trailing behind just out of earshot for the rest of the trip. We never got their names so we got to know them only by their footprints in the snow; Long Stride and Reasonable (stride) Guy. I am pretty sure that we could tell every time that they traded turns kickstepping in the snow. Thanks for the steps on the descent!

Though it looks unlikely, just around the corner of these ledges is the top of the Boston Glacier.

We arrived at the Boston Glacier at 2:30pm. I knew that the weather was forecasted to be more iffy on Sunday, so we contemplated doing the route that evening and bivying on the summit. We decided to chance a Sunday summit because the snow was gloppy in the afternoon heat and stayed at the base of Boston peak. As the sun set, the winds picked up and clouds started to pour over the top of Boston and Sahale.

A last look at the route (marked in green) before going to sleep:

We awoke to this: Buckner is over there somewhere…..
[url=http&#58;//outdoors&#46;webshots&#46;com/photo/2688184530101779210ksadlZ:1czn71uw][img:1czn71uw]http&#58;//inlinethumb02&#46;webshots&#46;com/44609/2688184530101779210S600x600Q85&#46;jpg[/img:1czn71uw][/url:1czn71uw]

We had taken some time to study the features of the route and the decent in case things became socked in, so we decided to hike over to the start of to the route and see if things didn’t get worse or perhaps even improved a bit. 

I took us about an hour to get to cross the Boston Glacier and reach the start of the route. We had our second bit of luck here. During the hike over, the clouds parted, the sky cleared up and another perfect sunny day was upon us!
[url=http&#58;//outdoors&#46;webshots&#46;com/photo/2288718200103926705piOAFp:1czn71uw][img:1czn71uw]http&#58;//inlinethumb39&#46;webshots&#46;com/44134/2288718200103926705S600x600Q85&#46;jpg[/img:1czn71uw][/url:1czn71uw]

We began by simul-soloing up the lower portion of the route. The snow had firmed up nicely. We used pickets for a running belay shortly after crossing the bershrunds on the left-hand side. 
[url=http&#58;//outdoors&#46;webshots&#46;com/photo/2413048470103926705BZEseE:1czn71uw][img:1czn71uw]http&#58;//inlinethumb48&#46;webshots&#46;com/42671/2413048470103926705S600x600Q85&#46;jpg[/img:1czn71uw][/url:1czn71uw]

Our first running belay pitch brought us up and through the notch of rocks on the center of the face. 

Hayley climbing up the lower face towards the rock notch:

Hayley took the next section and led another running belay up most of the upper face.

I finished to the top:

We spent less than three hours on the route. All in all: the route was almost over too soon, (though my screaming calves would have to disagree with that statement). We relaxed on the summit for a bit; Hayley’s 38th Bulger 100 peak. 
[url=http&#58;//outdoors&#46;webshots&#46;com/photo/2678694170103926705yMMCol:1czn71uw][img:1czn71uw]http&#58;//inlinethumb11&#46;webshots&#46;com/41994/2678694170103926705S600x600Q85&#46;jpg[/img:1czn71uw][/url:1czn71uw]

Then we began the 10 hour grueling march back down the SW face, though Horseshoe basin and over the Sahale Arm. 

Looking back to the summit from Sahale Arm:

We both really enjoyed this route. Besides the steep snow on the north face, there are many unique challenges in just getting to the route that make it an all around great alpine objective."
"Mount-shuksan","Shuksan, Sulphide Glacier","Mélanie, Jean and I went to Shuksan this WE. We left Friday afternoon and summited on Saturday morning. 
The final central snow gully is in great condition (but no more for skiing for those who are interested) 
Because, sometimes pictures speak better than words, I just wanted to share some photos of this amazing ski trip (without any doubt in my TOP 5 of all the routes I've done so far).

,"Skier rescued after 4 days out","A few folks have asked me for details about this rescue. The guy sounds like he's made of pretty tough stuff... The following article is from the Ellensburg Daily Record, and is much better than the Seattle Times one. \
\
\
By ANDREA PASCOE and PAT MUIR\
\
SNOQUALMIE PASS - An Ellensburg man missing for four days and four nights in the snow-covered wilderness near the Alpental ski area was found alive Sunday afternoon.\
\
Dan Witkowski, 25, was airlifted Sunday by military helicopter to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle where he remained this morning in serious condition.\
\
Kittitas County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Fred Slyfield said this morning Witkowski was found by searchers after a helicopter noticed a set of ski tracks in the snow and followed Them.  \""They found the single ski trail and a single bootprint trail in the snow from the helicopter,\"" Slyfield said. \""He was found around 4 p.m.\""\
\
Slyfield said Witkowski was found four to six miles west of the ski area in the Pratt River drainage - one ridge away from the Interstate 90 corridor. \
\
\""He is very, very lucky,\"" Slyfield said. \""He's lucky it's not 48 hours later because there is a big snowstorm coming in.\""\
\
For four days Bob and Maryann Witkowski prepared themselves to lose their son, who had not returned from a solo New Year's Eve ski outing.\
\
By 4 p.m. Sunday, an hour before search and rescue teams were to end the search, Bob Witkowski, Ellensburg's community-development director, had all but let go, he said by telephone Sunday from Harborview.\
\
\""I knew they were going to call me at 5, and I knew what they were going to tell me: that it's over,\"" he said.\
\
Instead, just as he was about to take a walk outside to say goodbye to Dan, Bob got a call from Gary Vanlandingham, the search and rescue chaplain.\
\
Dan was OK; they found him.\
\
The emotions he went through Sunday can't be put into words, Bob Witkowski said.\
\
\""At this point, mentally and spiritually, you're starting to let go of him, because you know it's probably not going to end well,\"" he said.\
\
Instead, thanks to one last-ditch search of the rough backcountry, Dan Witkowski ate his first meal of the new year Sunday night. His parents had to feed him because his hands suffered severe frostbite, but he is in stable condition at Harborview, Bob Witkowski said.\
\
Through a voice cracking with dehydration, Dan explained that he had been able to survive by walking throughout the day and night, drinking from streams, and stopping only for 15-minute catnaps under trees, Bob Witkowski said. Dan was under one of those trees when he heard a search helicopter, he said. Dan staggered out and soon was surrounded by rescue workers, Bob Witkowski said.\
\
The reunion of parents and son came later and was filled with indescribable emotion, he said.\
\
\""It was hard to even talk,\"" Bob Witkowski said. \""I just wanted to touch him. We just wanted to touch him and feel him.\""\
\
Sunday night, Bob Witkowski still could not really describe how he felt except to say he was grateful to all the King County Search and Rescue personnel, the Kittitas County Search and Rescue people who helped out, and the volunteers who searched for four days. Their efforts have made him want to be a better person, himself, he said.\
\
\""They took my estimation of  human nature, and they raised the bar,\"" he said. \""If they have that in them, everyone has that in them.\""\
\
Scores of people had been looking for Witkowski since he was first reported missing Thursday. Witkowski had failed to meet up with friends on New Year's Eve and his car was found parked at the Alpental ski area in Snoqualmie Pass, off Interstate 90 about 40 miles east of Seattle.\
\
About a foot of snow fell in the area on Saturday, and searchers feared that if they didn't find him in the clear daylight Sunday, they might not find him at all. A bad storm is expected for later today.\
\
Temperatures in the central Cascades had dropped way below freezing, with a low of zero degrees reported Saturday night at nearby Stampede Pass. Alpental reported 8 degrees Sunday.\
\
The King County Sheriff's Office sent up three helicopters Sunday with spotters on board who were familiar with the terrain. Northwest of the ski area, they recognized intermittent ski and boot tracks in the new snow.\
\
A team of six rescuers on skis set out for the area, but because they had to hike over much of the terrain, it took them more than seven hours. They reached Witkowski as dusk fell after 4 p.m.\
\
The helicopters might never have flown over the area had not two independent witnesses come forward to say they had seen someone matching Witkowski's description heading northwest out-of-bounds last Wednesday."
,"Winter frolicking in the N Cascades","Here's a short summary to prove I haven't been sitting on my sofa and knitting sweaters all winter:\
\
Bryce, Norbert and I spent three days after Christmas at the Mountaineers Lodge at the Mt Baker ski area, and managed to get trapped in a big storm, followed by cold and POW POW! The first day we just circled around the lakes by the lodge a couple times because it was storming wildly. The next day, the first challenge was finding the Honda Civic under the two feet of snow that had fallen. Even though the weather hadn't really gotten much better, and every single ski patroller made a worried face, we ventured out of bounds toward Austin Pass. Breaking trial was a terrible chore in the bottomless powder, and we went for perhaps a quarter mile along the road until we went back to seek the toasty refuge of the lodge. \
But the last day, oh my! It was cold, dry, and beautiful. We finally made it to Artist Point and tromped around the high plateau up to the base of Table Mountain. The snow was pretty stable, but there was a lot of it and we didn't want to take any chances by going any further. The descent gave me my first ever taste of what people talk about when they get all excited about the powpow. So deep and steep, soft and fluffy, mmmhh... \
\
Then last weekend Kevin had the brilliant idea of trying to ski Hidden Lake Peak as an overnight, and Norbert and I joined the fun. The scariest part came early on, with the early flurries of ARCTIC BLAST sending dozens of cars into the arms of Mr. Ditch, and transforming Sedro-Wooley into Fargo, ND. Then, after the scariest part, came the coolest part. That was driving along Cascade River Road, which had a foot and a half of powder on it. Kevin's old faithful Subaru sprayed big plumes of snow, and we made it almost to the Sibley creek turnoff. And then came the most boring part: skiing up the incredibly flat logging road. For miles. And miles. And it snowed. And powder avalanches would come down from the trees, accompanied by blasts of cold air that took your breath away. Finally we got to a point on the ridge leading up to the peak where we thought we could take a straight shot through the forest. Not! The snow at 3000 feet didn't have any substance to it, so we either scraped over sticks, or slid sideways on frozen dirt. This sucked, and our ambitions were trashed. Better snow was at least a thousand feet higher, and it was getting colder by the minute, and why not do this as a wonderful spring ski? We turned around, scooted down the agonizing road, and decided to spend Sunday at Mt Baker because the weather was supposed to become beautiful. \
\
The drive there took four hours due to the icy roads. We stopped by the Mountaineers lodge again to warm up and get hot water and scraps of food. The warmth of the fireplace was tempting, but really, we had come to test our expedition gear and see how we would do camping out at 0 degrees Fahrenheit. Being Cascade-raised sissies, this seemed pretty frightening. Well, we survived the night alright, scurried back to the lodge for breakfast and admiration, and then set out to ski up to Herman Saddle. Skiing was a lot of fun, and on the upper slopes the sunshine made it T-shirt toasty. This, combined with the wind, created some soft slabs that released here and there, while the dry powder in the shade stayed nicely in place. We ended up not going all the way to the saddle, but rather followed a skin track up to the middle of the ridge that rises above Bagley Lakes. This point was taller than the top of Table, and we had amazing views of everything. Too bad I couldn't feel my toes anymore, or we would've stayed longer. Skiing down was, again, a blast! I was getting more worried about the toes though, and once we were back in the car and driving home, they would not thaw for a long time. Amazingly though, after two hours the right pinky toe started wiggling, then the other ones joined in, and it was a happy party. Not a single waxy-white patch of skin remained. \
\
Yesterday I skied from my house through Ravenna Park and along the Burke Gilman trail all the way to my lab at the western edge of campus. Hey, what did everyone else do for Snow Day? Even if you don't have time to go out and climb sick stuff, you must've done something that's worth sharing with everyone on the board."
,"Banks Lake Ice","Went out to Bank's Lake Saturday and managed to get some ice in despite the warm temperatures (40F!). Everything was pretty wet, so I wouldn't expect much to be around for long if this warmth continues...\

,"Lake Valhalla (area) Snowshoeing - Jan 11","On Sunday, Jim, Laura, Lindsey and I headed out Route 2 to try snowshoeing into Valhalla Lake.  The first part of the hike climbs slowly but steadily on snow-covered road before heading off into the woods.  Shortly after, we reached a junction with prints heading left (downhill) and right (uphill).  We chose to go up.  Which wasn't the right way to the lake, but did lead us out of the fog clinging to the valley and up onto a beautiful ridge.  We stopped at the end of the ridge, enjoyed the views, tried to see the lake through the fog below, and then headed back to the car.  Very satisfying day.  I'll have to go back sometime and find the lake!  \
\
Fairly scenic snowshoe with low avalanche danger.  The two miles of forest road that one has to hike in are my biggest complaint.  Would also recommend going left at the junction if you want to get to the lake."
"The-tooth","TR:  The Tooth via Northeast Slab","Short version:  Elain and I climbed the Northeast Slab on the Tooth, but did not do the final North Ridge scramble to the summit.  We descended by rappelling the ascent route.\

"Dickerman-mountain","Mt Dickerman - Jan 19","\""So the Mountain Loop is bare all the way to Barlow?\""\
\""That's right.\""\
\""But it's still gated at Deer Creek?\""\
\""Yes.\""\
\""How about Mallardy Ridge?\""\
\""Well, the road's bare but the county put up a large snow berm to keep cars out.  Have you thought about hiking to Lake 22?\""\
\""I'll keep it in mind...\""   <!-- s:roll: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_rolleyes.gif\"" alt=\"":roll:\"" title=\""Rolling Eyes\"" /><!-- s:roll: --> \
\
So that's how the conversation went with the park ranger at Verlot on Sunday morning.  That didn't stop Jen Gregory, Charles Peach, and I from topping out on Mt. Dickerman a little after noon a day later.  \
\
We parked a Deer Creek this morning in the fog, got on our bikes, and headed up the Mountain Loop.  The patches of ice made things a bit interesting, but we reached the Dickerman trailhead in good order.  Snow started around 3500, deepening rapidly as we reached the meadows.  No one had been to the summit recently, so we blazed our own trail, heading up wet consolidated snow to the peak.  Just as we finished lunch, the sun burned through some of the clouds, rewarding us with views of Forgotten and Big Four.  Both ascent and descent went quickly and without incident.  Didn't see another soul the whole hike, which was kind of a rare experience on Dickerman.  Fun hike and good times had by all."
"mount-baker","Baker via the Easton 6/27-28","A hardy contingency of UWCCer's and friends headed up to Baker for a summit attempt via the Easton Glacier route.  This was a first glacier climb/summit attempt for several people.  Short version, we safely put all 9 group members on the summit, and had a good time, while experiencing a bit of everything a Cascade volcano offers.

We met up at the Sedro-Wolley ranger station Sat morning to combine our Seattle/Everett/Bellingham members into a solid group of 9 (Mark, Mehul, Dave, Zoe, Kurt, Amittai, Jackie, Mason, and myself).  We drove the rest of the way to the trail head, to find a very packed parking lot, which we barely managed to fit our three vehicles.  Packing and gear sorting found us hiking out around 11am.  Snow starts about a mile in, and becomes solid in the high meadows.  The railroad grade is melted out however, making for quick travel.  We found a nice camp spot on the edge of the Easton glacier, with a good amount of melted out rock for cooking and lounging, and a nice melt water trickle.  We spent the evening setting up for the morning, eating, taking some pictures, and doing some crevasse rescue refreshing.  Alarms were set for a 1:30am departure.  Clouds were building as we settled in to get some sleep, and shortly after going to bed, I heard the sound of drizzle and the occasional shower.  I looked out of the tent at 1am, to a total whiteout.  Visablity was 10-20 ft, and everything was soaked.  The decision was made to check on conditions in a couple hours, but everyone went back to bed with low hopes on a summit bid.  At 4am I looked out and saw the clouds had risen somewhat, with a few breaks, and by 4:30 the summit was clear, with only a low marine layer building below us over the sound.  We decided to go for it, and quickly got packed and ready to go.  Several groups had left during the night in the worst of the weather, and many more were heading up at various stages of their summit bids.  We roped up at he edge of the glacier and were climbing by 6:30.  We climbed in 3 rope teams, and made steady progress up the  well frozen glacier, crossing a couple of solid snow bridges.  As we gained elevation, the wind really started to pick up, and we made a couple of stops for food and layers.  By the time we reached the crater rim, the wind was high and steady, and we pushed on up the Roman wall and the steepest slope of the climb.  Other rope teams slowed this part down a fair bit, as we got bottled up below some very slow teams.  We all made it up and had a quick break, and took some pictures.  The top had very high winds, and it was too cold to stay long.  Lower clouds obscured most peaks, but Rainier, Glacier, and Shuskan were visable, perhaps the most dramatic summit view I've ever had.  The trip back down was mostly smooth cruising, except for two of the snow bridges were getting spicy as they melted out.  Mark also felt a section of snow 10 ft away from one crevasse settle under his feet.  No problems though, and we were soon back to camp, to eat, re-hydrate, and then pack up and head out.  We got back to the car just after 6pm.

This was a fun trip, and a good introduction to climbing big mountains, and glacier travel.  Got a bit of everything with the weather.  Good times had by all.  There were many camera's out and in use on the trip, and hopefully people will post some pics.  Thanks to everyone for making the trip a big sucess."
,"Snow School TR !!","It will be too difficult for any one person to write a trip report that describes the experience for all 30+ people who participated in Snow School, so let's hear from everybody.  I invite everyone who has something to say about this trip to share their thoughts about it.  Describe your favorite (or least favorite, or both) moment of the trip.\
\
My favorite moment was on Saturday afternoon, standing on top of the snow embankment, looking around, and seeing so many climbing clubbers having fun.  Despite the wind-driven snow and cool temps, everyone did great, braved the elements, and shared some good times.\
\
My least favorite moment was on Sunday morning, hiking across the visitors' center parking lot, and being downwind of the World's Most Powerful Snowblower.  Ralph, Cynthia and I had our faces completely encrusted with ice in thirty seconds and were nearly blown over the Tatoosh.\

Thanks to everybody who came out and made this such a fun trip!  Stay involved in the club and come on more trips!"
"Red-mountain-snoqualmie","Commonwealth Basin - Sat, Jan 31","On Saturday, Marty Weinless, Aaron Zabriskie, Lindsay Malone, and I headed up into Commonwealth Basin with the intention of climbing Red Mountain.  Didn't make it all the way up, but had a good time slogging around through 2+ feet of fresh powder in the basin.  A light snow fell for most of the day, keeping visibility low, but we had occaisional glimpses of Guye, Kendall, and Red.  The snow on the side of Red was rather odd.  Light, fluffy powder over a base layer of crumbly ice.  All the rain we got last week seems to have really consolidated the snow that fell earlier in the season.\

"Cathedral-rock","Cathedral Rock","With a good weather forecast and desire to get out of town for a full weekend, Frank, my sister Katie, roommate Nic, and I headed out for a weekend with the initial plan to hike the Deception Pass loop in the Teanaway area.  We left Seattle Friday afternoon to pick up Katie in Renton, which we decided is about the edge of the earth.  As payment for driving to the edge of the world to find her, she baked a pizza for dinner that we enjoyed on the drive to the east side.  We camped by the overflowing Cle Elum River and enjoyed an evening of cards and laughter.  
Saturday morning, we headed up the road to once again find Scatter Creek impassable by small car.  Three weeks ago this was also the case, but we thought conditions might have improved by now.  Twas not to be, so we forded the creek and hitched a ride to the trailhead in a macho car.  Much relieved to see a dry and snow-free trailhead, we headed up the Deception Pass loop the clockwise direction, first towards Cathedral Rock.  Clockwise is the recommended direction by Frank's hiking bible.  The trail begins with easy switchbacks up the side of the valley, finally rewarded with a nice view to the south.  After Squaw Lake, we had some more switchbacks and ran into snow.  We meandered uphill and reached the ridge immediately below Cathedral Rock and stopped for beautiful views and another lunch break.  The view down to Deep Lake was gorgeous and we briefly considered changing plans to that direction.  Instead, we forged ahead with the trail covered in white and unmarked.  Heading down a gully, we missed the trail's turn into the valley and instead descended a slightly sketchy hillside to a nice hanging valley.  Once on solid, dry ground in the valley, Frank scouted around to see if we could relocate the trail.  He returned all smiles with two thumbs up, so we eagerly started downhill on a great trail down out of the hanging valley.  Our excitement was short-lived, however, as this downhill trail leveled off, turned a corner back south (we wanted to head north at this point), and ominously started a gentle uphill grade, which turned to switchbacks soon after.  After weighing our options, it seemed the best decision at this point was to finish this loop detour and camp.  This was Nic's first backpacking trip and he deserves major props for sticking it out with a great attitude.  We were all tired and ready for dinner, laughed as we headed back up the hill to right where we missed the trail down by about 30 ft.  Bummer.  We went up the gully a little more, then found a nice level spot to camp for the night.  We had a wonderful freezer bag recipe Obadiah posted and enjoyed a spectacular sunset, the views all directions were awesome.
Sunday morning we awoke to some worrisome clouds to the northwest, which luckily broke up fairly quickly and we had another day of perfect weather.  We packed up comfortably and headed back up to Cathedral Rock and out the way we came in.  At Squaw Lake we had a leisurely lunch stop and Frank and I went swimming, if you can call jumping in for about 10 seconds swimming...The hike downhill went smoothly without event and we met a really cool couple who volunteer their summers (for the last 16 years) living at the Fish Lake Guard Station and checking up on campers, trails, etc.  What a retirement job!  
At the trailhead we didn't find a ride down the road, but the meadows, wildflowers, and slow river were a scenic distraction from the road walk.  We were happy to find the car across Scatter Creek in tact, present, and snaffle-free.  We headed home, found Renton again, and then found a BBQ and party from the Rock and Roll Marathon in full swing at my house, which was a perfect way to end a most pleasant weekend.

I'd really love to do this hike again and finally find the especially deceptive Deception Pass.  It worked out well to do what we did, the volunteers told us there was also a landslide further down the trail to Deception Pass and the snow just makes route-finding a little more challenging.  Maybe next time Scatter Creek will be low enough to drive across too.  <!-- s:) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\"" alt=\"":)\"" title=\""Smile\"" /><!-- s:) -->"

"Tolmie-peak","Tolmie Peak","Six of us went.  Josh, Ryan, Chris, and myself all had AT setups with Dynafit bindings and Scarpa Lasers.  Poor Kevin was the only pinhead, and Kevin's roommate was snowshoeing/boarding.  Josh (Jean-Marie) made me choose a French name to go with my AT setup -- I christened myself Guillaume after a good friend of mine.\
\
We followed Mowich Lake Road until directly south of Tolmie Peak and then went due north through timber.  We had to dodge a few cliffbands, which left us a little too far east.  A traverse west took us to Eunice Lake.  Kevin and I were relishing our brand-new skins; the others were cursing our steep tracks.  The traverse was too much for Kevin's roommate -- snowshoes without poles on a steep slope isn't very enjoyable -- so he declined to go to the lake.  We hung out at the lake for a while, taking pictures.  \
\
We reversed our tracks for the descent.  The upper timber section had steep, wet, heavy, crusty snow that could be best negotiated with aggressive jump turns.  The combination of bad snow, trees, and steepness was a bit much for me, so I side-slipped a lot.  Once past the cliffbands, the slope mellowed out for some enjoyable glade skiing.  \

,"Marten Creek Snowshoe - Feb 16","Lindsay Malone and I headed up to the Mountain Loop in the rain yesterday to try to find some snowshoeing along the Marten Creek Trail.  I've driven past the trailhead dozens of times without giving it a whole lot of thought.  Turned out to be a price nice (if really wet) hike/snowshoe.  The trail gains elevation rapidly over the first mile, following an old road bed (which seems like it would have been some kind of crazy drive) up to the Marten Creek Valley.  The snow deepened enough here to warrant snowshoes and we wandered on what we thought seemed like a trail through the forest.  Crossing Marten Creek (which was a bit tricky - props to Lindsay for finding a shallow, rocky area before I tried to shimmy across a log) we headed up a low ridge, continuing through the forest.  Rather astonishingly, we did stumble across some old cutting - so I guess we were on the trail - though from what I understand, few people push on past the creek.  Eventually, route finding became more difficult as the forest thickened.  We turned back maybe a little more than a half mile from Granite Pass.  I'd hoped we might be able to get up to the pass to have a look around, but the day got too late and we got a bit too damp, so we turned back and followed our tracks back out.  Not much in the way of views, though we did get a few glimpses of the surrounding peaks.  Might be better as a hike in the summer - or with better visibility."

"Mount-si","Mount Si 2/22/04","The short version:\
\
I climbed Mt Si this morning as a quick fix for my mountain withdrawal.  The views were great, the crowds were thin on the way up and thick on the way down, and I got to eat the eggs.\
\
The long version:\
\
As I was feeling intense \""wilderness\"" withdrawal after being forced to stay in lab during the recent weather window, I decided on the spur of the moment (Saturday, 11PM) to climb Mt Si this morning, despite having a family brunch planned for 10:30 this morning.  I figured if I left around 6:30, I should be able to get up, down, back and shower in time for this brunch.\
\
Instead, I woke up at 6:30, spent a surprising amount of time having breakfast, and arrived at the trailhead at 8:00.  Looking at Si from the road, it appeared that it was in summerlike condition; no significant snow was visible.  After climbing a mostly bare trail (except for a few melting snow patches at the summit plateau), I arrived at the base of the crux \""haystack\"" section around 9:30.  The traditional NE (?) haystack gully was a \""mixed climb\"" due to lingering snow patches (in other words, I sometimes had a hard time deciding weather to grab a rock, or plant a snowshoe pole).  I lingered on the summit for a while, enjoying the views from Rainier to Baker, and the precipitous drop to the Snoqualmie confluence before downclimbing the gully (this felt a little sketchy because of the look-longer-than-they are fall lines and some hard slick snow).  I looked at my watch and realized I had spent a full hour, it was now 10:30 and I was missing brunch!  \
\
I proceeded to run down the trail.  In the process, I came across quite the motley assortment of Mt Si tourists, from the hardcore trail runners in shorts/tshirts and running shoes (one guy was running it at least twice; he passed me going up, down, then up again!) to the overly optimistic couple with full glacier garb: goretex top and bottom, gaiters, ice axes and I presume pouched crampons in their packs (I'm not sure where they were hoping to find ice).  Several people appeared to be having trouble with the \""ice runnels\"" section of the trail, below the first boulder field.  I finally arrived at the brunch at noon.  Fortunately the food was not all gone (scrambled eggs, roasted potatoes, and the infamous \""kringle\"" pastries) and nobody minded my stinky clothes.\

It was warm.  We took our shirts off and rolled up our pantaloons.  We were confused.  Why isn't it cold?  Why isn't the sky grey?  Why aren't we wearing lots of clothes and big heavy stiff boots?  Where are all the sharp metal things?  What is the deal with having pro every six feet?\
\
We climbed 12 routes from 5.9 to 5.11b at Sunshine and Millenium Walls.  It was fun.  I didn't remember how to rock climb, so I pretended I was ice climbing naked and just pulled really hard.  It was a gorgeous day, we had lots of fun, and the only sour note was the disgusting sweet/salty/spicy dried guava I had brought along.  That stuff is disgusting.\

Link to information on road repairs in and around the Darrington Ranger District from last fall's floods.

,"Heather Ridge","A weekend ago, Ryan Forsyth and I went to Heather Ridge, hoping to get some freshiez despite the avalanche forecast (considerable to high).   We had our hopes up, so we decided to check out the open slope run on the East Face.  As we were traversing the ridge over there, we're noting (from the trees and the cornices) that the slopes were wind-loaded.\
No big deal, maybe it's not too dangerous... after all, here's our chance to ski mad powder!\
We got to the top of the run and dug a pit.  As we were cutting the back of the block with the ski (no pressure applied), it sheared 30 inches deep.  FUCK!  The layer it sheared off of was an old raincrust practically made of ball-bearings.  Guess we're not skiing that slope!\
\
So we traversed back along the ridge, where on top of an innocent knob, I heard and felt an unmistakable \""Whump!\""  Damn, this snowpack is unstable!  We skiied through the trees in sweet powder, having to traverse about 3/4 of a mile on the old railroad track back to the parking lot.  We then went back up the south slopes and skiied a run in there.  My, the sunny weather had made the slope much heavier and wetter than in the morning.  It was good skiing, but not good enough for us to yo-yo again.  As we drove back home, it rained on us."
"Snoqualmie-mountain","Snoqualmie Peak ski","Dave Schuldt, a friend of his [who's name escapes me, but he's a high-school math teacher), and myself went up to Snoqualmie Peak in search of some spring skiing.

From Cave Ridge, we worked our way up the south slopes of Snoqualmie, traversing a little west towards the summit.  The snow was very hard up there; ski crampons were helpful.\

By the time we headed down, the snow softened up nicely, and some herbal supplements got us all primed to rage.  Not too much to be super slushy, but just enough to carve sweet turns.  We skiied down the way we came up and passed a party on their way up.  I imagine their experience skiing down would be full of slush; we found some slushy spots in the trees below Cave Ridge.  \
\
Getting an earlly start was critical for the trip, as we got incredible conditions on the way down.  In addition, avalanche danger is likely rising as the afternoon goes on and the sun bakes the slopes.\

Sweet snow!!!"
,"X38: Far Side is dry","Went to the Far Side today with some friends, climbed a few routes 5.8-5.11a, it was sunny but a bit breezy.  Every route at that crag is dry, it was a pleasant day.\
\
On the way home I saw some kayakers loading their boats onto the roof of their car, it looked like they had just run the falls on the South Fork of the Snoqualmie.  Damn, I wish I had seen them do it, that is a line I have scouted and couldn't completely see the landing."
"Whitehorse-mountain","Whitehorse Mountain (attempt) 3/14/04","Short Version:\
\
Aaron, Jim, John, and I attemped to climb Whitehorse Mtn via the Glacier route but turned around at the base of the Whitehorse Glacier (4800 ft).  Another party of two left the parking area just ahead of us and did manage to submit - their TR may be found here: [url:3drgm52d]http&#58;//www&#46;cascadeclimbers&#46;com/threadz/showflat&#46;php?Cat=&Board=UBB2&Number=321749#Post321756[/url:3drgm52d]\
\
Long Version:\
\
After some bouncing around on the access road, we started up Snow Gulch around 7 am.  Avalanche debris extended all the way to base of the gulch and we headed up, following in the wake of the other climbing party.  At 1600 ft we reached a series of high waterfalls.  Our options were to head right into a patch of trees, head left up an exposed rock ramp, or head far left into a mass of alder.  The other party had chosen right, so we followed after them, forcing our way through tangled brush and up slippery heather until he hit a sketchy, exposed traverse over slick rocks.  We called out to the party ahead of us who responded they were breaking out their rock pro  <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\"" alt=\"":shock:\"" title=\""Shocked\"" /><!-- s:shock: -->  so one of them could lead a 5th class pitch.  Lacking comperable gear, by group vote, we decided to down climb back to the base of the waterfalls (probably the most difficult thing we did all day) and then ascend through miserable alder short order we popped out in a rather benign gully and headed through much more mild brush until above the waterfall.\
\
Above this, we opted for snowshoes, then crampons, and made very good time, reaching the base of the glacier around 1 pm.  However, it was late enough in the day that we decided not to go for the summit (still 2000 glacial feet above us) and, after enjoying spectacular views of Baker and Shuksan, turned around and headed back downhill.  The mountain decided to throw a few snowballs at us on the way down, but we stayed clear of any serious trouble.  Note: there is an enormous hanging snowblock (25' x 100' x 300') on the side of the face.  If and when it breaks loose, I would not want to be standing in the gully system on the left side of Snow Gulch.\
\
All of us agreed that we'd like to give it another go - maybe by the same route next year or via Lone Tree Pass later in the season.  Great day to start the spring climbing season.  Pictures to follow shortly."

"Mount-rainier","Worst trip ever!!","We had big plans to ski up and around van Trump park on Rainier on Saturday. Carol, Josh, Ralph and I left early Saturday morning and promptly got lost on the drive. I had my head under a blanket for most of the way there, so I was of no help whatsoever. I was nursing what felt like a hangover of massive proportions, except I didn't think the one Bud light I'd had the night before could be responsible. I chalked it up to the usual pre-trip late night and little sleep syndrome. \
\
Eventually we got to the trailhead where I knew I was in trouble. I felt like utter shit - body aches, evil headache, dizziness, nausea. I was screwed, because there we were, almost 3 hours from town and I couldn't go anywhere. The others were sympathetic, but they couldn't do anything about it either. So they started skinning up the trail. I spent the day in the car, trying to sleep. It really rocked. \
\
I wasn't there, but from the sounds of it, I didn't miss much: thankless thrashing through steep trees, a crazy creek crossing, crappy skinning and no views whatsoever. Apparently when they stopped they could sort of see a place that looked like it might have been cool had they gotten there, but they didn't get there. On the way down I don't think anyone got more than a couple of turns in. Ralph ripped a binding out of one of his skis and was if a foul mood when he got back. Carol was the most cheerful: \""well, we certainly got some fresh air\"". \
\
When we finally got home, I showered and went to bed at 7:30. I was sick all day Sunday and am still sick today, although getting better. I came in to work just to write this killer TR. Awesome, eh?!"
,"Exit 32: Sunday March 21","My girlfriend and I headed out to Little Si to climb on Sunday.  The weather was awesome, super warm, and everything was totally dry.  I hadn't climbed outside since November, so it was good to be back on the rock again.  We started at Blackstone Wall where we did Human Foot (5.8, blocky arete, pretty fun) and The Big Easy (5.9, really long, almost 30 meters).  We then moved on to A.W.O.L. where we did Godess (5.10b, awesome face climbing on jugs, highly recommended), and then on to World Wall I where we did Aborigine (5.11b, done it before, but always super fun) and Reptiles and Amphetamines (5.9, maybe the biggest holds of any climb I have been on, short but really good).  All in all a good day, and I hope to get back sometime this week if the weather stays like this."
"Buckhorn-mountain","Buckhorn Mountain TR 3/20 - 3/21","Short Version:\
\
Lindsay, Eric, Rusty (the dog), and I hiked up to Buckhorn Mountain via the Tubal Cain Mine trail over the weekend.  We enjoyed amazing weather, even better views, and some of the most bizzare trail conditions I've ever seen.\
\
Long Version:\
\
Leaving the trailhead at 7:00 am, we quickly covered nearly three miles of gently sloping trail through rhododendrons and western hemlock before encountering lots of ice on the trail.  Didn't slow us down all that much and after some slipping and sliding, reached the fields beneath the old mine.  After checking out the old mine (which apparently goes back in 3000 ft into the mountain), we crossed Copper Creek and began switchbacking uphill on snow alternating between icy and consolidated.  The trail takes what Beckey would refer to as, \""unecessarily low-gradient switchbacks\"" but since this was the first time I've had a pack on since August, I was somewhat grateful not to be climbing too steeply.  Above 4000 feet we finally lost sight of the trail for good and had to spot cleanly chopped branches and roots to make sure we were still on route.  Through luck, we managed to stay on route until emerging in a wide meadow and heading up to the wrong ridge.  From the high point, we could see Buckhorn Pass, Deception, and Constance.  We descended down to another snow-covered meadow and set up camp amongst the trees.\
\
The next morning, we woke to conditions every bit as clear as the day before and even warmer weather.  After a slow start, we stashed our packs, and headed up to Buckhorn Pass.  Reaching the pass in good time, we turned our eyes towards Buckhorn Mountain.  Since we'd drifted back under the rain shadow, we were able to follow the actual trail for a bit.  The trail leads right to the base of Buckhorn - outlined by rock border.  The summit was, much to my relief, mostly a walk-up.  Rusty, ever the wonderdog, did several laps from summit to saddle while we climbed.  From the rocky summit, we could see (among other sights): Baker, Glacier, Ranier, downtown Seattle, the San Juans, Pacific Ocean, Constance, and Deception.  Eric, who had been up this way several times said he'd never seen the skies so clear.  After enjoying a bite to eat on the summit, we headed back down to camp (with a brief sidetrip to recover an errant water bottle).  The trip had taken us longer than we anticipated and we didn't break camp to head down until 1:00 PM.\
\
And then the fun began.  Without our packs on, we had still been able to walk on the surface of the sun softened snow.  Fully burdened again, all of us started post-holing almost immediatedly.  After a half mile of misery, we strapped on our snowshoes and began making much better progress.  For a few minutes.  Once we broke out of the trees and hit open slopes the snow had become so soft that our MSR's couldn't get any purchase.  Basically, they'd wrench your angles to the same angle as the hillside, and then start to slide down.  Good times.   <!-- s:roll: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_rolleyes.gif\"" alt=\"":roll:\"" title=\""Rolling Eyes\"" /><!-- s:roll: -->   Remembering the misery of postholing, we elected to leave our snowshoes on, eventually reaching a wide gully remembered from the ascent.  Here, Lindsay and I took off our snowshoes, immediatedly post-holed to our knees and waited for Eric to catch up.  Our progress had been terribly slow and we worried we wouldn't be able to get back to the car by dark.  For the next hour we alternated speeding along exposed trail and sloshing through slush until reaching another snow-covered slope dropping all the way down to the creek.  Across the valley, we could see our tracks from our visit to the Tubal Cain Mine and we decided to try to glissade down, cutting off over a mile of switchbacking.  Reaching the base, we stumbled across a climber's trail which met up with the main trail at the base of the switchbacks.  Extraordinarily pleased with ourselves we romped back down the trail, crossed Copper Creek and reached the ice.  \
\
The trail had been icy on the way up.  After a good day of melting it was like a skating rink.  With two trekking poles I barely managed to keep my balance and Lindsay and Eric were doing even worse.  Even Rusty, with his built in crampons, was skating around splay-legged on the ice.  I'd carried up crampons expecting icy snow, and now (despite feeling really silly), strapped them on and used them to great effect on the ice.  Who ever heard of using crampons at 3000 feet on a trail?  Reaching the end of the ice, we flew back to the car, piled in, and zoomed back to Seattle just as the skies clouded over and the rain began to fall.\
\
Awesome hike.  First time to the Olympics for me and I can't wait to go back."

,"TR: First weekend of spring, Snoqualmie Pass environs","Jon Jantz always rags on me for never posting trip reports.  This one's for you Jon..\
\
Last weekend saw some fine skiing.  A cold front dropped 6-10\"" of snow most places south of Mt. Baker (they got a bit more, 18\""), then the weather cleared into crystal clear.  Last week's heat consolidated the snowpack and left warm air in place;  the precip started as rain in most places on Thursday, then changed to snow as the temps cooled.  The gradual cooling trend stably bonded the new snow to the existing snow, then the cold weather Friday/Friday night froze the old snowpack solid.  Essentially, it was a ski tourer's dream.  A stable, firm base supported 6-10\"" of stable powder.  Low avi hazard, good skiing, sun, long days.  The good life.\
\
On Saturday John Mauro and I took advantage and skied from Alpental to Granite Mtn.  Dan scoped out the beginning of this tour on a gear recovery mission from Lower Tuscohatchie Lake and said it looked good (the 4-day lost skier was found here in January, but the rescue operation left some gear at the lake, and Dan volunteered to retrieve it).  From Pineapple Pass, we descended through nice powder into the very upper reaches of the Denny Creek drainage, then climbed to Hemlock Pass.  We skied down the Pratt River a bit, then climbed to a ridge above Lower Tuscohatchie Lake before skiing down to the lake.  We skied up the long valley past Tuscohatchie Lake, tucked picturesquely below Low Mountain's couloirs, climbed to the connecting ridge between Granite and Low, then followed it to the summit of Granite.  The wind was howling on the summit of Granite, sending a continuous plume of spindrift of the SE ridge.  Fortunately we found a protected spot to enjoy the view.  We skied down the SW rib of Granite in surprisingly good corn.  The strong winds that arrived with the new snow stripped the ridge clean, and we were skiing on the sun-softened crust.  We ran out of snow around 3300 ft, then walked down through open timber until intersecting the trail.\
\
On Sunday, I skied Kaleetan with MW8 from turns-all-year and his friend, Ron. From the south (say, from Granite) Kaleetan is striking.  The steep south face narrows into an aesthetic, sharp pyramid.  An elegant gully climbs directly up the pyramid directly to the summit, providing a superb decent.  We skied over the Chair-Bryant col to Upper Melakwa Lake, then skied and kicked steps up a steep gully to Kaleetan's south ridge.  I skied (my partners walked) up most of the south face, then when the terrain got too steep and narrow for skinning, switched to axe and crampons.  We climbed directly to the exposed summit, took some photos, clicked in and pushed off.  3\"" of delightful corn above the old firm sun crust led us down to the steep east face which we skied directly to Melakwa Pass.  Down the thickening powder bowl past Chair Peak Lake to Snow Lake.  Across Snow Lake, up to the Snow Lake Divide, then down to Alpental.  By the early afternoon, all the new snow had gotten thick, even on north facing slopes.  The old crust below was still supportive if one turned delicately, and while the snow was heavy, it was still smooth and enjoyable.  It is like skiing powder in slow motion.  The balance is more delicate, but the slowness allows one to concentrate on all the subtle nuances of the turn.  This tour and summit is one of the most elegant, clever routes I've skied near Snoqualmie Pass.\
\
Everyone skis for different reasons.  Some like putting in skin tracks and yo-yoing laps in the powder.  Some like skiing hairball routes, some like pounding bumps at the lifts, and still others like carving arcing turns on the groomers.  I like doing all of these things at time or another (except skiing bumps, and perhaps skiing hairball routes), but I enjoy touring the most.  I love exploring new places I haven't been;  when the conditions are right, skis make it extremely efficient to cover long distances.  It's amazing the routes that can be strung together, the tiny cols that can be passed giving access to entire worlds beyond the next ridge.  Now that spring is upon us, the weather and snowpack are allowing access to previously forbidden domains.  I can't help but to be excited."
"Mount-rainier","Skiing almost to Muir","A month ago I wouldn't think I'd be saying this...  but I attempted to reach Camp Muir with an RMI guide leading the group.  He was off-duty, admittedly, but nonetheless started off with a very guide-like \""I want you all to have fun today...\""\
\
There were 7 of us on a mix of AT and tele skis, and unusually we had more women than men.  (Why don't more women back-country ski?  None of us could answer the question.)  Visibility on Saturday varied from ok to poor, with intermittent glimpses of the partly clouded summit.  The gate at Longmire opened at 10am and we got on the trail a little before 11am, part of an ant line of people.  Chris lead at a totally mellow pace which was pleasant for a change (most of my partners think \""mellow\"" means \""not hallucinating for lack of oxygen\"").  We approached the steep section below Panorama Point from just above the Nisqually.  We had a choice of steep snowy slope with the Nisqually as runout 1000ft below should anything slide, or steep icy slope just to the right.  Given the recent snow and thus avalanche risk, we took off our skis and Chris kicked steps into the ice for the rest of us.  The rest of the antline turned around here, so as far as I could see, we had the  whole Muir snowfield to ourselves.\
\
We had set a turn-around point of 4pm and stopped about 1000ft below Muir.\
\
On the descent, visibility dropped to a couple hundred feet.  It was actually quite nice to have someone along who knew the area well.  And had GPS.  At one point, we mistakenly thought we had skiied too far left and were heading towards that road that heads east or maybe northeast of Paradise.  It turned out we'd gone too far right, and were just below the ridge that drops off into the Nisqually.  The snow conditions varied from soft and easy to hard bumpy ice, with no fluffy powder to be seen.\

We debated whether to aid or lead the first pitches of Town Crier, since apparently we were both feeling mellow and I'd wanted to go out there to aid.  But as I looked at the crack and started commenting that it looked climbable and planning out gear placements, Chris said \""ok, do it.\""  The first pitch is a 5.8/5.9 hand crack, depending on which book you read (my personal rating gauge is out of calibration).  Then a beautiful ledge on which to pretend one is a cat in a sunbeam.  Then a short 4th class traverse.  Then an akward 5.8 chimney pitch, leading to another fine sunny ledge.  Put long slings on the pro in the chimney or your partner will swear at you if he's silly enough to jug instead of climbing.  Then a C1/C2 pitch, where you aid up to a roof and pendulum over to another crack, skyhook the crack while bitching about hooks, aid up on itty bitty nuts or cam hooks, place a little TCU, do a couple cam hook moves while bitching more about hooks (\""you placed them right side up, right?\"" -- partner's helpful comment), and declare that hooks are scary by definition (\""no, you really like them\"" -- partner's supportive reply)."

The decent gully is also free of snow, and the cairns actually seemed to have survived the winter's avalanches intact.

We opted for fording and quickly found a spot to cross that was a fast moving shin-deep side channel followed by the belly-button-deep (for us tall guys) somewhat swiftly moving main channel. This is followed by ~1hr walk up a road and then up a steep, infrequently used, unmarked climbers trail.

In order to save time we carried 25draws and simulclimbed pretty much every pitch under 5.9. The route begins with 5 pitches of mellow slab climbing (done as 1 simulclimb pitch), followed by some pretty fun climbing through pitch 12. Then &quot;pitches&quot; 14-17 - a long runout single simulclimb ~500ft, 5 bolts (including anchors. a bush or two in there as well. somewhat loose rock with very few possibilities for good nut placements). After that there are 7 very enjoyable pitches (including the crux pitch at 10c and the two last beautifully exposed, fun, high quality rock pitches) to a nice summit with good views of the local peaks and Rainier. 

At this point it was 6:30pm and we faced the long, occasionally creative (remember those bushes. also, the pitches are frustratingly long - most are too long to rap with a single 60m rope and generally are too long to link, even with two ropes) rap down. Fortunately (and by simulrapping) we made it through the trickier upper half of the pitches before it got dark. Also - lesson learned here for me - make sure your headlamp has reasonably good batteries before setting out on a potential epic (luckily Luke had already learned this lesson and was prepared). Made it down to the base around 11:30 (a few missed rap anchors on the slab), lost the trail in the dark and bushwhacked about about half way down to the road, forded again in the dark, and made it back to the car around 2am."
"Bare-mountain-alpine-lakes","Bare Mountain TR - 4/10/04","Lindsay, Darragh, and I hiked up Bare Mountain yesterday in superb conditions.  Well, superb weather, at least.  The snow conditions were horrible - about an inch or two of sliding slush over very consolidated base.  The trail follows an old logging road for the first mile and a half before breaking out into a snow covered basin reminiscent of Glacier Basin in the Monte Cristos - only the surrounding peaks aren't as high.  Views from the top of Bare Mountain included Baker, Glacier, and Rainier.\
\
North Fork Snoqualmie River Road is drivable to within a mile and a half of the trailhead (and the Bear Creek washout).  I would imagine that within the next three weeks if this weather keeps out, it will be melted all the way out.  However, a quarter mile from the trailhead, a large tree is down across the road - so the services of someone with a chainsaw will be needed before driving all the way to the trailhead becomes and option.\
\
Trail was snow-free until over 3000 feet.  Hiking season's coming early this year!   <!-- s8) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cool.gif\"" alt=\""8)\"" title=\""Cool\"" /><!-- s8) -->"
,"Cascade Pass","Sarah and I slogged up to Cascade Pass with our snowboards on Saturday.  The road is indeed gated at around 2 miles shy of the parking lot (at around 2400 ft), and for good reason, the washouts are huge.  The weather was great and we marveled at the mounds of avalanche debris in the valley floor. Lots of ice climbing potential all over Johannesburg, Cascade peak, and the Triplets.  It's suprising that area doesn't see more action, given how accessible it is.  Riding back to the car was fun, although the 3000 feet of elevation went by a little quickly."
"Mount-rainier","Rainier via Gib Ledges 4/9-4/10: it's a party!","Summary:\
\
My partner Andy Lewis and I summited Rainier Saturday morning via the Gibraltar Ledges.  The route was in decent shape, the weather was fantastic, the descent was interesting, and the social scene at Muir was the most fun I have ever had up there.  Lots of climbers took advantage of the favorable conditions and most parties summited.\
\
Full Story:\
\
Andy and I had been waiting for the right opportunity for our return engagement with the Ledges, and this weekend looked perfect.  Last February we made it to just below Gibraltar Rock before turning around on account of poor snow conditions.  The wealth of information available from other recent successful parties on the route was helpful in planning.  We took minimal equipment.  I took my 2,200 cubic inch alpine pack carrying 24.5 pounds to Muir, so we were able to pack fairly light.  We left Paradise at 5pm on Friday and arrived at Muir at 9 to take the last two spots in the hut.\
\
A good many parties were planning on climbing the Ledges, so Andy and I decided to make a late start.  This way we could benefit from a well-established boot track in front of us.  Maybe we are lazy, maybe we are efficient, but the main thing was that we did not want to be waiting around under the loose choss heap at the base of the exit chute for several parties in front of us to negotiate the end of the crux.  We quietly attended to our usual division of labor:  Andy melted snow while I made dinner.  After our traditional Muir meal of Sastrugi Profigliano we crawled into our bags with hot water bottles.\
\
Some groups began stirring as early as 1am, but the majority of the parties departed at 3.  Andy and I were on the route at 4 under a bright moon.  The morning was reasonably mild.  Despite the clear night, I was comfortable climbing in my base layer and soft shell jacket.  Since we were already familiar with the start of the route we left the rope in my pack and cruised straight up the left edge of the Cowlitz and moved onto the ridge to reach the bottom of Gibraltar Rock.  This was a superior line to following the ridge the whole way, as we saved some time bypassing the Beehive on the snow below the ridge.  The snow conditions were great and we knew where the schrund was, so we chose to climb unroped.\
\
At the base of Gib Rock we caught up to a party of two who were planning on skiing down the Ingraham.  We watched them negotiate the traverse, and one of them was having a slow go of the icy sections in his aluminum crampons.  Meanwhile I fought off an acute attack of the screaming barfies, jumping around in the choss like a giant pumpkin in my down jacket.  Andy and I made the traverse easily.  While waiting we had a good look at the icefall and had plenty of opportunity to contemplate the dire consequences of a fall down the Nisqually, but once we began moving the crisp neve made for secure cramponing and the traverse went quickly.  At the base of the exit chute we were feeling strong so decided to pass the skiiers.  From the approach to Muir this section looks steeper than it is.  The chute empties out over the upper Nisqually, so there is a little exposure, but it only felt like a 40 degree slope.  With the excellent snow we climbed it side by side and stopped in the sun atop Gib Rock to rope up.\
\
While preparing for the upper mountain, we saw a group on the Ingraham try to cross a crevasse on the steeper part of the slope.  After several tries they turned back.  Now back in familiar territory I steeled myself mentally for the remainder of the climb.  The first time on the upper slopes I was fooled repeatedly by the skylines:  \""That must be the crater rim!\""  This time I knew not to be fooled.  Just put your head down, keep moving your feet, and eventually we will get there, I told myself.  The last thousand feet can be deceptive to the hopeful climber.\
\
At the giant crevasse at 13,000 feet we caught up to a party of three who were crossing it directly.  Andy suggested we go around the end, which allowed us to keep our rhythm.  The altitude was beating me down, but I knew we were through the biggest challenges of the route, so from here it was just a question of willpower.  At 11am we reached the crater rim and strolled across to Columbia Crest.  We hung out for a little while, enjoying the views, and chatting to another party that had been ahead of us.  It was a stunning view.  We could see south to Jefferson, and light glinted off the cars in the Paradise parking lot 9,000 feet below us.  Andy and I dedicated the climb to our friend Todd, a Rainier summiter who had died in Iraq last fall.\
\
Back across the rim we crawled into a gap between the snow and rock to heat some water and prepare for the descent.  We zipped down the first 1,000 feet in half an hour, leaping across the crevasse at 13,000, then continued swiftly down and scoped out a line onto the Ingraham.  I suggested we downclimb from the ridge to bypass several crevasses, so Andy went first on my boot-axe belay.  I joined him, kept going, and we soon found ourselves frustrated with the snow conditions.\
\
Part of our gamble in making a late start involved a late descent.  We figured that since summit temps were supposed to be around 20 degrees we could make it down the Ingraham without too much hazard.  We were wrong.  The snow was warm enough and soft enough to be really sticky.  Each time we lifted a foot a canteloupe-sized snowball clung to it, even though we had high-perfomance new duct-tape antibotts on our crampons.  This made things interesting, since we didn't really want to be sliding around above the enormous crevasses on the Ingraham.  We continued as best we could, knocking our axes against our boots every step or two to clear the snow.\
\
If poor footing wasn't enough to worry about, there was evidence of some very recent icefall.  Some large seracs had collapsed halfway down the glacier on the east side.  We moved as fast as we could to traverse beneath the giant towers of ice leaning ominously above us, and were relieved to reach the relative safety of the Ingraham Flats.  That glacier is pretty imposing.  We chose to take the longer route around Cathedral Gap, since we didn't want to deal with more steep soft snow and crevasses that awaited us on the Cowlitz side of Cadaver Gap.  There must be a good reason why that notch is so named.\
\
The crowds at Muir were enormous.  A veritable tent city had sprung up beside the hut, lots of people were milling around, and there was quite a hubbub as the stream of snowshoers, hikers, climbers, and skiiers continued to arrive.  We found my friend Matt, who had joined us on the hike to Muir, and he generously melted some snow for us while we rested.  I began packing outside for our descent to the parking lot when our friends arrived.  A group of our rafting friends had ascended for the day to meet us at Muir.  Three Katherines, Jones, and Anker showed up bearing smiles, congratulations, and two six-packs of beer.  What a welcome!  We sat in the sun and had some laughs.\
\
Soon thereafter I was surprised to see Aaron Z. arrive, we discussed the route and I shared my beta, which wasn't a whole lot.  He and his group had similar conditions to look forward to, so I wished him the best of luck.  Mike from Feathered Friends came over to chat, I joked around with him for a while, and gave him our last four cans of beer before departing.  He was hilarious:  \""Sweet!  Thanks, Nick.  We have some Red Bull we can mix this with.\""\
\
I ran down the Muir Snowfield.  The highlight of the descent was the glissade from Pan Point.  There was a nice toboggan chute that made for a great slide.  Below there I hiked down with another climber who had been at the summit with us.  We chatted the rest of the way down, and the social scene in the overnight parking lot was energetic.  There was more warmth and cameraderie among strangers than I have ever experienced before on Rainier.  I relaxed in the sun with lots of other folks there.   One was a fellow NOLS instructor who had done the Nisqually Icefall with a team that included a 19-year old girl for whom this was the 12th Rainier summit.  Her father had also summited via the Ledges that day.  It was lots of fun to relax in the afternoon sun, drinking beer, and meeting fellow climbers.\
\
Overall I would say that the Ledges was a more fun route than the Ingraham Direct.  It had more variety and was very aesthetic.  The ledge traverse and snow chute exit were cool on account of feeling simultaneously sheltered beneath the giant mass of Gibraltar Rock and exposed above the ice fall.  I think the ledges would be terrifying in warmer conditions, but since everything was frozen in place we had no rockfall.  There are two rocky sections on the traverse right now, and ice on the second rocky section.  I doubt very much that this route will last beyond the weekend if the current warmth continues.\
\
I hope I still have enough energy to go to the Modest Mouse concert tonight.  It might be a bivy in the balcony of the Paramount...  <!-- s:? --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_confused.gif\"" alt=\"":?\"" title=\""Confused\"" /><!-- s:? -->"
,"TR: Ice axe shenanigans in the Alpental valley 4/10/04","A group of 7 (David, Donald, Eben, Heather, me, Steffen and Yana) assembled at the Burke\
Saturday and then reassembled in the Alpental parking lot with intentions of some ice axe practice\
Up There Somewhere. Yes, I misread the web page, and the  Alpental ski area was open that\
day, but we found reasonably steep snow just opposite, just a wee bit up the way towards\
Cave Ridge. At first, given the slope's west/NW exposure, we were in shadows and the snow\
was pretty firm. Great for ascending (as others in the area found out) but not so great for\
sliding -- particularly with big trees blocking the run-out. But the sun peeked out over Guye,\
and the slopes warmed up, and people's confidence increased, and soon we were all flying\
fearlessly down in all the usual kamikaze variations.\
\
After a lunch break, Yana took her leave, and the rest of us tried for N. Guye peak, but, interestingly\
enough, the snow was too soft to accomodate us, given certain employment- and family-induced\
restrictions on return time, so we settled for a subsidiary bump. Gorgeous weather, excellent views.\
Finishing the descent with a hilarious ride down a long glissade chute (right down through the\
practice area of earlier, where it had seemed steep and foreboding), everyone seemed to have\
gained the usual appreciation for \""butt-sliding\""!\
\
Good fun, thanks to everyone for coming out."
"index","Index! 4-11-04","Ian and I climbed up Rattletail in three 30m pitches.  Yes, this is the same climb that resulted in a helicopter rescue last weekend.  The climber linked pitches 1 and 2, was running it out some, fell, hit the belay ledge which thankfully has a lot of dirt on it, bounced, and fell further before the rope stopped him.  I heard he's going to be ok, dunno any more details.\
<!-- m --><a class=\""postlink\"" href=\""http://www.stanford.edu/~clint/index/rattle.gif\"">http://www.stanford.edu/~clint/index/rattle.gif</a><!-- m -->\
\
Then we climbed the 5.10a just left of it that's not shown on the topo above.  (60m pitch, anchors in the middle make two 30m raps possible for descent.)\
\
Then we toproped some route whose name and rating I'd be awfully curious to know because it spanked my butt so completely.  If you look at the above topo, there's a bolted 5.12a arete shown on the topmost pitch.  It's on the right side of the arete.  We top-roped a climb on the LEFT side of the arete, also bolted.  I couldn't do the crux, and the rest felt 5.12 to me.  Anyone know what it actually is?\
\
Anchor/rap beta: Top of Rattletail pitch 1 has a large flake with slings around it (with biners).  Top of pitch 2:  slings around a tree (with rap rings).  Top of pitch 3:  slings around tree.  Each face of the arete also has a pair of bolts.  The left face has bolts & webbing & snaplink.  The right face has chains (this is better than rapping off a tree, since you'll pull less stuff down onto yourself when you pull the rope.)"

\
Long:\
\
We departed Seattle at 7:30PM Saturday night and arrived at Marble Mountain snowpark before 11, after stopping at the closed Jack's Restaurant briefly to make a \""good faith effort\"" to acquire climbing permits.  After a 4AM wakeup the next morning we were on the trail by 4:50.  There was still enough snow that we were basically able to skin from the parking lot; Dave and Gary on their AT skis and me on my lightweight nordic trail skis.  It stayed quite warm overnight, and the warm winds that occasionally hit us and the extremely slushy snow had us worried about poor snow quality higher up.  The moon rose soon after 5:00 and cast erie shadows in sparse timber below treeline.  We emerged in the snowy meadows below the main slopes at sunrise, and stopped briefly to take photos of Hood and scope out the (seemingly obvious) route.  Our worries about snow conditions were partially put to rest by the increasingly strong crust for the remainder of the route.  Gary and Dave skiied/skinned and I hiked (due to my flimsy ski setup) up 4000 feet of largely straightforward and featureless snow slopes.  Arrived at the crater rim just after 10AM to stunning views of the blast zone, adams, rainier, the goat rocks, hood, and one peak behind hood (Bachelor? Sisters?  We weren't sure).  We saw one guy snowboarding down around 7AM who had apparently hiked in overnight, and caught another skiier at the summit; we were surprised by the relative solitude on such a sunny holiday weekend.  Not to worry, though, a group of a dozen or so mounties was slogging up, spread over 1000 vertical feet or so as we started our descent.  Dave and Gary appeared to have a blast making tracks, figure 8s, etc as we stayed mostly on the west-facing side of the ridge which hadn't yet turned to mush.  With my insufficient equipment I used a mixture of kick turns and long traverses, ass-slides and running plunge-steps to descend, and made a resolution to myself to get real ski mountaineering gear before my next trip with ski mountaineers.  We got back to the car a little after 1PM, put on clean clothes and drove back arriving in Seattle around 5PM, less than 24 hours door-to-door.  As a side note, the burger barn (or some similarly named restaurant) in Castle Rock makes kick-ass milkshakes, but their french fries are pretty nasty.  Gary got the onion rings, maybe they were better?\

Pictures may or may not arrive eventually."
"leavenworth-area-climbs","Exit 38 / Westport / Leavenworth","The weather this past weekend was so good that it would have been a crime not to have been out climbing.  I managed to stay at school until noon on Friday, but then I had to bail and go climbing.  My brother (who was visiting from Vancouver) and I drove out to Exit 38 and hiked up to Nevermind.  We started on Strip Clip, a 5.9 that climbs a ramp on the right side of the wall.  From this we hung the draws on Culture Shock, a fun and steep 5.12a.  I had sent this last fall, but then I had to stop climbing for the winter since one of my fingers was bothering me, so I was not sure how I would do on it.  Luckily it went well, and I was able to send on my second try, feeling more solid on it then when I did it last fall.  We then did Big Mama, a 5.10c which branches off from Strip Clip.  We then moved to the other side of the wall and did Steep Street, a really fun short 5.10d that was steep, like the name suggests.  We finished on Neverigine, a 5.10a that I don't particularly like, but always seem to do when I am at Nevermind.\
\
On Saturday we took a break from climbing and drove to Westport to surf.  The weather was awesome there too, and we had a really good time.  The waves were about head high, really clean with a light offshore wind, some of the best conditions I have been out in.  The water wasn't even as cold as I expected, I had been surfing off Vancouver Island the weekend before (in Tofino) and it was way colder there.\
 \
On Sunday we decided to drive to Leavenworth for some climbing.  We first headed to Rattlesnake Rock for some sport climbing.  We warmed up on a 5.10a (can't remember the name), then did the 5.10d at the left side called Flying Circus.  We then moved around to the front of the wall and did Rock n' Rattle, a 5.11c which is on the cover of the Washington State Climbing Guidebook:\
[img:1vrmm6ne]http&#58;//www&#46;climbingwashington&#46;com/classics/images/rocknrattle1&#46;jpg[/img:1vrmm6ne]\
(that is the photo from the front of the guide, it still looks the same but the tree is dead and has moss on it).  It is an awesome climb, thin and technical on the first part, then it kicks back at the end and you climb out a super fun overhang.  After that we did a 5.11a to the left of that called Tubbing at the Rittenhoff, also really fun, and a similar style of climbing.  We had meant to go do some single pitch trad climbs after climbing at Rattlesnake Rock, but we were both pretty tired after a full weekend, so we drove back to Seattle and ate hamburgers and ice cream while watching Faulty Towers episodes.\

Sorry there are no pictures, I didn't bring the camera with us at all."
"Mount-rainier","Rainier via Gib Ledges 4/10-4/11: And Everyone's Invited","Fellow Mounties Jerry and Bruce and I attempted the Gibraltar Ledges route on Rainier, but had to turn around at 13,880 when our pace got dangerously slow, ~ 300 ft. per hour.\
\
The Muir Hut was hopping like it was Memorial Day weekend as we got there Saturday afternoon around 3:30.  Several people had summited that day, including Nick Bratton who was having a celebratory Bud Light(Shouldn't it have been Rainier beer?), and all gave encouraging beta.  The three of us were able to grab spots in the crowded hut thanks to Nick's team clearing out after we got there, and after eating and such went to bed early.\
\
Got up 2:00am, melted drinking water, roped up, and were first party climbing our route under bright stars by 3.  Took a fairly direct path up the upper Cowlitz and over easy snow slopes to the base of Gibraltar Rock in an hour.  Another half-hour or so had us through the slightly sketchy loose rock and hard snow of the ledges to the exit chute on the edge of the Nisqually ice cliff.   Got to the top of the easily-climbed chute in another hour and were greeted by real strong winds at the gap between the Ingraham and Nisqually glaciers.  The wind was blowing the rope sideways between Bruce and me so strongly that I couldn't pull it back in, and it got stuck under a cornice on the Ingraham headwall side of the gap.  Flipping it was useless so Bruce tried to pull the rope straight through the cornice which I put to a stop when I saw several climbing parties below on the Ingraham.  He untied and we got the rope back in order and were at the large crevasse on the upper Nisqually at 13000 by 6:00.  Walked a ways around the crevasse to the west among several other parties and then got in the boot track that went straight to the summit.  Almost 3 hours after we got to 13000 we were only at 13880.  Bruce was not doing well and I had a pretty good headache going myself, so even though it was only 8:45 we called it and headed down.  \
\
Descent was warm and a bit scary as the crampons balled up every step while we made our way through the creaking Ingraham ice fall.   Took off the crampons after the headwall and protected some moderate crevasse crossings with pickets as we made our way to Cathedral Gap and Camp Muir.  My headache had been getting increasingly worse with the bright sun and heat, and once at camp I lied down and puked and dry-heaved for a while before crawling into my sleeping bag for a nap.  Got up an hour and a half later, disposed of my blue bag, and we got out of there.  Got the route, but not the summit, I'm 0 for 4 now on Rainier, but it was a beautiful weekend and great climb nonetheless.  Had views from Jefferson to Baker and everyone in our party saw someone they knew, can't wait to get back and tag that summit."

"snow-creek-wall","Orbit (alpine cragging?)","Sunday, April 18, 2004\
\
Paul had never been trad climbing nor done multi-pitch.  I'd never been on Snow Creek wall.  We were a perfect match for an attempt on Orbit.\
\
In the car, I explained to Paul the sequence of multi-pitch climbing; what to do if we ended up out of hearing range; how to clean pro; to never untie from the rope; and to be sure to always either be clipped to an anchor or on belay.  We hiked in to Snow Creek Wall on Sunday morning.  The goats came by to greet us.  We mostly soloed the first pitch (I belayed Paul on the last move to that tree with an S-shaped top).  2nd pitch:  a pleasant chimney with one 5.8 move.  3rd pitch:  a blah 5-easy traverse.  4th pitch:  The recommended and typical route is a 5.9 finger crack, but we decided to try the easier variation to the left.  It turns out to be easier initially, but as I bemoaned what felt like the first of several 5.10a moves going into an upcoming stretch of no pro, Paul said he wasn't really up for that.  I down-climbed the 15m or so back to the belay.  I would have suggested that we traverse 15ft right to the standard finger-crack, but Paul admitted he was feeling both tired and sick, so we decided to head back down.  That area is grid-slung so we had no trouble rappelling on a single 60m rope.  The moment my feet touched the ground at the base of the wall, I noticed my stomach hurt.  I ate a bagel and some trail mix.  I watched a goat watch another climber peeing.  Then the goat came closer.  Then it decided not to wait and try to drink straight from the fountain, prompting the climber to stop mid-stream and go find another pissing spot, much to everyone else's amusement.  We started hiking back down, and my tummy only felt worse.  Finally, it hit me:  PMS cramps.  Damn.  I don't usually get them.  I took a Vicadin, although I'm not sure whether it or sitting down in the car helped more.  I bought a yummy Riesling (white wine) at the store beneath the yummy Italian restaurant in Leavenworth.  The pesto pasta was excellent.  A good day, all around.  Paul got to try trad and multi-pitch climbing (although admitted he'd like to build up more slowly to future trips) and I got to spend a mellow day in a pretty place."

"colchuck-peak","TR: Colchuck 4/10/04","A week ago, Jim and I planned to climb Colchuck via the North Buttress Couloir.\
\
We left Seattle at 8am Saturday morning for the drive to Leavenworth.   We had to stop about 1.5 miles short of the Mount Stuart trail head due to snow cover.  Started hiking at 11.45am.  The weather was great, sunny and warm.  Since the trail was mostly covered with snow I used snowshoes right from the beginning.  Jim made it without for a while; he put his on later.  We met about 3 parties coming out.  Some had climbed Colchuck, others had hiked in earlier that day and found the snow too slushy for a ascend that late in the day.  There was also some talk about an avalanche the night before down Asgard Pass.  Everybody assured us that the frozen Colchuck Lake can be crossed - no problem.  The last third of the trail, just before Colchuck Lake where it steepens, was a bit more difficult to follow and  we got lost for a minute but found the trail again quickly.  We reached the lake at around 4pm and were impressed by the sight of Dragontail and Colchuck. Since it was still pretty early, we decided to make camp at the south side of the lake to have a short approach to the base of the couloir in the morning.\
\
To get to the other side of the lake we had two options: Crossing it or walking around it. Since the sun had been beating on the lake for a few hours by then, the surface of the ice was melting and big puddles had formed. Because of this and since nobody else was in the vicinity we thought that it would be a major inconvenience if somebody broke through the ice in the middle of the lake. So we decided to walk at the east side around the lake. There was a boot path, so other people had done the same. At the beginning, the path was well on the shore but at some point big boulders where blocking the way and it went down onto the ice. Somehow we followed the paths onto the ice, which, in retrospect, wasn't a reasonable thing to do.  As the two of us (both, by the way, theoretical physicists) where just discussing that the ice would probably be the thinnest near the shore and thicker in the middle of a lake, and therefore maybe this wasn't such a good idea, just in this very moment it happened: I confirmed our theory about the ice thickness by taking the term \""breaking trail\"" too literally and crashing right through the ice with a big splash. Luckily, this happend close to the shore and, since the water was wet and cold, I was out of there in no time.  Nevertheless, I had been up to my waist in the lake and was dripping wet. So we retreated carefully and made camp at the north shore on a few large boulders. While I tried to dry my clothes and rewarmed in my sleeping bag, Jim managed the kitchen with skill. We figured that with my wet boots the climb wouldn't happen and instead of staying overnight we decided to hike out the same evening.\
\
We were on our way at around 7.15pm, the sun set half an hour later, and we hiked out the rest of the way back to the car with our headlamps. It was a beautiful night, clear skies, perfect weather for a climb... Arrived at the trail head 10.30pm, got a snack in the only gas station in Leavenworth that was open that late and where back in Seattle at around 2am Sunday morning.\
\
Although we didn't reach our objective, fun was had by all anyway.\
\
Lesson learned: Don't walk on thin ice.\
\
Gear we used: snowshoes and headlamp\
\
Gear we didn't use: rope, pickets, a set of nuts, 3 cams, biners, crampons, bivy sacks, ...\
\
Gear I didn't bring but probably should have: 2nd set of dry clothes, a hair dryer for wet boots"
"The-tooth","TR: Tooth 4/22/04","Short version: Jim and I climbed the Tooth.\
\
Long version:  Jim and I conquered the mighty Tooth today.  Left Seattle 6.30am, arrived at the trail head at 7.30am.  Postholed our way up to Pinapple Pass in 2,5 hours (snowshoes would have helped).  We met two other people who were skinning up and definitely had a better time in the snow.  We particulary enjoyed the time-delayed punch trough...  Anyway, started climbing by 10.30am, and arrived at the summit 2 hours later.  The whole route is snow free except a small patch in the class 4 section.  The two skieres were the only other people we saw the whole day.  This unusual fact and the gorgeous weather with great views from the summit made for a very enjoyable climb.  After 5 rappels, more postholing, and a lot of glissading we arrived at the car 3.30pm to get back to Seattle just in time to hit rush hour."
"leavenworth-area-climbs","How to wreck your hands in three easy steps!  L11 4/24-25","This past weekend the Rude Americans descended upon Leavenworth for a multisport outing.  Ryan, Marcie, Ben, Tracy and I learned how to mangle our hands, and you can, too, by following these three easy steps:\
\
1.  Suck at crack climbing\
2.  Go crack climbing in Icicle\
3.  Go paddling on the Wenatchee\
\
By taking this simple course of action you will first shred the skin on the backs of your hands by employing inferior technique on ragged granite, and then you will add injury to injury by sunburning your hands the next day while kayaking/canoeing.\
\
Saturday we climbed many routes at Pearly Gates.  Ryan and I did 7 routes, Ben and Tracy climbed 6.  I led a couple 5.8 cracks, Ryan led all the harder stuff up to 5.10d.  We had some miserable moments, but the highlight of the day came on the 10c near the end of the day.  Ryan scraped his way up an awkward small dihedral to a roof, at which point he discovered a hands-free head jam rest.  He found some good gear in a crack just above the lip, pulled the roof, and sailed up the rest of the way.  The moves to get past the roof were fun, and we were rewarded for our efforts with a few face moves.  For much of the afternoon we were hounded by a persistent goat that the dogs found quite interesting, but eventually it went away.\
\
Saturday night we ate a really good pie Marcie brought from the peninsula.  Dee-lish.\
\
Sunday we slept in, had a leisurely start, and started paddling from the dam.  Ryan and Marcie were in their tandem open boat, the rest of us were in our kayaks.  The water level was low, but perfect for what we wanted to do.  Ben ripped it up surfing at Drunkard's, I was in heaven down at Little Snap wave, the canoers amazed the eddy gallery with their moves on the wave, and Ben finished the day with some sick rides on Grannies, a wave which wouldn't let me on.  Fun times were had by all, except for our hands."

In short, it was a very fun and narrow ski, similar in nature to the slot couloir on mt. snoqualmie but much steeper and narrower at the top. It's also about 2000 ft long..

w/ John Mauro, Phil Higuera, Jason Laramie\
\
From the south, Silver Star and the Wine Spires present a seemingly impenetrable wall.  However, from the north, the Silver Star glacier provides one of the nicest ski runs near Washington Pass.  I've never skied Silver Star, probably because the route up Silver Star Creek seemed a little too mind numbing.  But to somehow traverse onto the glacier?  Now that's the ticket..\
\
We left the hairpin at a comfortable post-dawn hour.  Several ups and downs and nine hours later we found ourselves skiing calf deep powder down the north side of Silver Star.  In the process, we broke a pole (bottom half of a Black Diamond, fixed with duct tape and a ski strap), a binding toe piece (G3, fixed with some bailing wire), and a tooth (biting a screwdriver, has yet to be fixed).  We managed to drink all of our water dry in the hot sun (4+ liters each) but the route worked exactly as planned.  Craggy granite spires, long memorable runs, larch dotted basins, we dubbed it the \""Snaggletooth Tour\"" in memory of our comrade's fallen incisor.\

"index","Double your pleasure:  Index AND X38 4/30, 5/1","The heat wave kept Ryan and I away from the snowy climbs and in the valleys this weekend.  Friday we went to Index and met quite a crowd there.  We climbed the first pitch of Godzilla, which was a beautiful line, followed with the slippery second pitch of City Park, and then bailed after looking at ledge fall/land on belayer's head potential of the third pitch.\
\
After an aborted attempt on the gooey-bolted 5.11a we sat in the shade.  It was beastly hot out there.  I led, um, Taurus, I think, and Ryan led the crack to the right of it after determining that Pisces was not so much fun.  Mark Husbands and I heckled each other for a while, and just when it was starting to cool down nicely we went home.\
\
Saturday we hiked up to the Mt. Washington crags and found the Shorts-Over-Polypro masses gathered at the Peannacles.  I wanted to give my painful new shoes a whirl on some moderate routes, but this plan didn't go quite so well.  After one route we continued up to Alpinia where Ryan led Green Buddha (11b) after a few painful experiments with the low crux.  I followed in the tight shoes, and learned that doing the crux quickly reduces the pain of the torquing fingerlock.  Ryan then took a nice long zinger on the adjacent 11d, and I ran up the 5.9 slab next door at Slumbersome.  A couple guys showed up with a pruning saw and did some trimming at the base of the leftmost 11a at Alpinia, so a fall should be less scratchy there.\
\
Down at Amazonia we played on the steeper stuff for the rest of the day.  I led Paste Human (10d), and chased Ryan up a bunch of other mid-10s.  Marcie hiked up for a few final routes of the day and  joined the Painful Shoe Club.  There are some awesome heel hooking spots on Radioactive Decay.  Climbing in the shade was much more pleasant.   <!-- s8) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cool.gif\"" alt=\""8)\"" title=\""Cool\"" /><!-- s8) -->"
,"Exit 32, Sunday May 2","On Sunday I took a break from studying for my Qualifying exam (next week) and Roanne and I drove to exit 32 to do some climbing.  We headed to World Wall I, and started on a 5.9 on the right part of the wall, called Opening Act.  It goes up a big flake, and was pretty fun.  We then did a 5.10b to the right of Reptiles and Amphetamines called To Jug or Not, it was okay, but we both found the start pretty awkward and the feet higher on the route were really polished (which is weird, because I almost never see anyone on it).  After that I had two attempts on Technorigine, taking one fall on each attempt, so that was good.  The second time I fell after the hardest climbing (the rest is big holds but you are pumped), so I think I will be able to send in a few more tries.  After this we moved to the left and did Megatherion, a 5.11b.  It was really fun, jugs the entire way except for 2 slopey holds you had to use to pull over an overhang.  The only downside was that the upper headwall section had a lot of moss on it, but most of the stuff you had to use was clean enough.  After that we headed back to Seattle for more studying.  All in all a good half day of climbing."

\
[color=blue:mnpa8pru]Godzilla:[/color:mnpa8pru]  Sat night, 7pm, over an hour of daylight left, and NOT A SOUL ON THE GREAT NORTHERN SLAB.  I'd never climbed Godzilla, so Ian lead and I followed.  I can see why people like this climb so much.  Very nice.\
\
[color=blue:mnpa8pru]Outer Space:[/color:mnpa8pru]  Sunday morning, 7am, and NOT A SINGLE CAR AT THE SNOW CREEK TRAILHEAD.  Too bad I didn't bring my camera.\
\
We started climbing around 9am. Ian lead up the Remorse variation, which if I recall correctly is 5.8.  It's three pitches.  He lead 60m and we simul-climbed the rest to 2-Tree Ledge.  Then I lead the crux pitch, with that famous 5.9 step out onto a face.  It was a very enjoyable lead.  Then Ian lead a pitch up to a pedestal, which has a fabulous belay ledge, and where I cleaned a \""Chouinard\"" bail biner someone had left. Retro, dude.  We hoped to simul-climb the remaining two pitches of 5.7 and 5.8 hand crack lined with chicken heads, but I ran out of pro at Library Ledge.  I wasn't over-protecting, but I wasn't running it out either.  The crack is just stays the same size (hand size). Since Ian now had all the hand-size pieces on him, and since we were in a hurry, he lead the last pitch.\
\
We got back to the base of the wall at 3pm.  We had a brief discussion of whether to go up MJD and risk a descent in the dark or do something else, quick lunch, and ...  \
\
[color=blue:mnpa8pru]Mary Jane:[/color:mnpa8pru]\
In contrast to a previous trip posted here:\
[url:mnpa8pru]http&#58;//bodenner&#46;net/~rkb/climb/lvn-apr-18-2004&#46;php[/url:mnpa8pru]\
[url:mnpa8pru]http&#58;//uw&#46;cascadeclimbers&#46;com/forum/viewtopic&#46;php?t=1504[/url:mnpa8pru]\
we did not get snowed on, and we ended up with more gear than when we started.  In fact, the weather was perfect: cloudy but not stormy. Mary Jane is really fun.  I don't see why more people don't climb it.   Ian was saying that it's just not as talked about, and that the pro isn't great (it gets sparser and sparser as you ascend)...  but gosh darn, it's such a nice climb.\
\
Towards the top, the dihedral gets rather mossy.  There's a shiny new bolt at that point.  Ian clipped a long sling to the bolt, descended a couple of feet, and traversed left to a crack.  The traverse looks really sparse, and admittedly handholds are really poor so you mostly rely on your feet, but the moves were actually much more solid than I expected.  And the bolt is above, so the consequences of the fall would at worst be swinging into the dihedral.  We returned to the dihedral just past the mossy section (10-15ft of moss).  The dihedral ends with a cool boulder move to get over a roof/block.  From there on up, it's mostly fun easy climbing on very sparsely protected chicken heads.\
\
We did not rap on either descent.  Thanks to this trip, Ian has now avoided rappelling on just more than half his descents from Snow Creek Wall.  I'm 2/2.\
\
My crack climbing skills are still not up to my face-climbing skills. I thought the 5.9 crux on Outer Space and the Mary Jane dihedral were both easier than the final 5.8 hand crack pitch of Outer Space.  Gym rat I be.\
\
In agreement with everyone who's offered their opinion, I think the descent kind of sucks.  It seems like a practical solution would be to put bolts and chains every 30m or 60m and create a straightforward rappel descent route. Given the number of bright rap slings on various rock protrusions all over the wall already, the bolts could even be called discrete.  But I have a feeling that someone from the Climbing Ethics Committee would be quickly dispatched to cut the bolts, so that alpine elegance could be preserved by continuing the tradition of the sandy descent, with multiple \""oh shit\"" rap slings dotting the view.  Would someone like to enlighten me, if I indeed am an alpine heretic, as to why my opinion is wrong?  Or alternately, tell me that I'm brilliant and should go out there right now with bolts and chains?"

"Dragontail-peak","TR: Dragontail via Colchuck Couloir, 5/9/04","This past Sunday, I climbed Dragontail via Colchuck Couloir with a Seattle Mountaineers group of 8.\
\
Some of us car camped at the Stuart lake trail head, others had left Seattle 2.30am...  In an effort to give back to the town of Leavenworth our party got awarded 3 (three) traffic tickets (2 for speeding, 1 for seatbelt) which amounted to nearly $300 in fines.  Anyway, at least those that missed out this time left the trailhead 6.30am in good spirit.\
\
The trail to Colchuck lake is nearly snow free by now.  We passed the lake around the west shore and were on our way climbing up the couloir between Colchuck and Dragontail by 10am.  The weather was gorgeous.  No clouds above us although there was quite some cloud cover in the west.  The snow conditions were  great for using crampons. While ascending the couloir a few rocks came raining down from Dragontail, just as described in the guide books.  Luckily, nobody was hit. At the top of the couloir we traversed left to enter another couloir that leads to the ridge near Pandora's Box.  This one was pretty icy and pretty steep.  Crampons were definitely necessary here and it was too steep for roping up.  A fall here would have been unpleasant...  At the ridge there was a pretty big cornice.  We set up a fixed line to protect the step over the cornice and the short but exposed class-4 scramble to reach the rock.  This procedure was quite exciting but everybody made it safely.  From there it was another 20min of scrambling along the ridge to the summit which we reached by 3pm.  After enjoying the views and having a late lunch we hiked/glissaded down to Aasgard Pass.  From the pass we carefully plunge stepped down the upper part until we reached snow that was soft enough to enable a safe and long glissade all the way down to Colchuck Lake.  After an uneventful hike out we reached the trail head at 7.30pm, 13 hours after\
we had started in the morning.\
\
This is a great climb with awesome views over the Stuart range.  The climb, although quite demanding, is techically easy, the only difficulty was crossing the cornice, which should be much less of a problem in a couple weeks.\

"Garfield-mountain","TR: Mt. Garfield Infinite Bliss","Pax and I climbed Infinite Bliss on Garfield this past friday, and it was good. Definitely worth doing, but not exactly what I would call a sport route. The scrambling in the middle of the route reminds you that it's actually an alpine climb... Definitely bring 4 or so TCUs for the running belays. We missed the bolted anchors above pitch 14 and just running belayed for 3-4 pitches up to the upper headwall.  The crux pitches on the upper headwall were full value: An almost 60m pitch of pretty consistent 5.10b/c, followed my another full pitch chimney (5.9/10a). \

If you're in the mood for a multi-pitch sport route though, the first 12 pitches are great, well bolted climbing with one 5.9 and one 5.10 pitch. \

Yesterday Ania and I skipped out of work early to go to Index with the goal of learning how to crack climb.  After stopping at her house for gear and a car, contending with traffic, and a stop at the Sultan Bakery for apple cups (which they were out of <!-- s:( --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_sad.gif\"" alt=\"":(\"" title=\""Sad\"" /><!-- s:( --> doughnuts had to suffice.) we got to the crag late in the afternoon.\
The plan was to get up to Breakfast of Champions, one of us would lead it and then we could do a few laps on TR.  I led up the first 5.7 pitch of Roger's Corner, which was a nice first pitch of the season.  Ania led the 2nd 5.9 pitch to the base of BoC.  \
There Ania claimed to be afflicted by laziness.  It seemed as good a day as any to bump my leading level from 5.8 up to 10a, and I had been playing at the UW rock, so I was feeling OK about a handcrack.  After about 6-8' of flailing, I announced that I was having questions.  Ania informed me that \""the answer is UP.\""  I struggled for another minute, decided that the answer was down, and climbed back down to the ledge, feeling like a total sissie.  After Ania reminded me of the untapped powers of french-freeing, hanging on gear, and general bad style, I rested for a minute  and got back on.  I think there was one piece in the middle that I didn't hang on.  I got in my first trad fall, a nice clean 5' drop on a #1 camalot.    But eventually I got up.  We did a couple laps on TR and rapped down in the near-dark.\
\
On the rap down I tried to clean a green alien that we'd left on the first pitch of Roger's, but I couldn't get it out.  So if you're headed to Index, there's some booty waiting for you.  After a stop at the Monroe Taco Bell, I was home around 11:30.   Thanks to Ania for a patient belay and a fun afternoon."
"leavenworth-area-climbs","Leavenworth: Rain, beer and minigolf","Roanne and I went to Leavenworth on Sunday morning for some climbing.  I have never bouldered there, so I wanted to take part in the bouldering tour by one of the guidebook authors that was taking place Sunday morning as part of the \""rockfest\"" event.  The forecast called for 30% chance of rain, but I figured nothing ventured, nothing gained, and what do those weathermen know, so we left early Sunday morning.  It was raining the whole way there after we hit the mountains, and although it looked a bit clearer in the town of leavenworth, there were still plently of rain clouds around.  We got to the prescribed meeting place (group campsite at bridge creek), but there was a light rain falling and everyone seemed to be packing up and goign home.  Everyhting was wet, but it wasn't raining too hard, so we decided to do some trad climbing since that would dry faster as long as the rain held off.  We headed to Alphabet Dome, and were eyeing Dogleg Crack, a fun looking 5.8.  It looked pretty dry, so I started up it, taking note of the sporadic patches of blue sky (it was not raining at this point).  The outside of the crack was pretty dry, but it was totally wet inside, which made climbing a bit more strenous since you had to hang on tighter because of the reduced friction.  I got about 3/4 of the way up and a light rain started to fall.  I thought \""well, hopefully this will stop soon, I will just hang out here for a bit since I was at a decent stance (right at the dog leg section of the crack).  But as time progressed the rain turned to a down pour which turned to hail, etc. and I lowered off my gear, totally soaked.  We then huddled under a rock in the pouring rain for a bit, and finally walked to the top and rapped down to get our gear back.  We then walked back to the car, and as we were walking back the rain stopped and it got nicer out, but everything was totally soaked.  So we went to leavenworth, ate sausages and drank beer, and then played minigolf (Roanne won).  The weather alternated between patches of sun and hard rain for the rest of the day, so we didn't get anymore climbing done.  This is the least amount of climbing I have ever done in a trip, not even a whole climb.  Pretty fun nonetheless though, I hadn't been trad climbing in a while and minigolf was good."

After a liesurely, 11 am start we took off on the North Fork Sauk trail in bright sun (so much for the rain  ) and took the turn-off to Pilot Ridge at 2 miles.  There is a massive logjam across the river, so no fording needed (or even possible this time of year).  From the river's edge, the trail switchbacks quickly up to the ridgeline, then rolls along until deep snow is encountered around 4000 feet.  We took a general easterly course and were pleasantly surprised to find the trail (snow free) again atop a narrow ridge.  For the next few hours we managed (with some freakish luck   ) to stay on the trail through long stretches of snow and were rewarded with some nice views of the Sloan Creek valley - though the fog definitely cut down on the views of any peaks.  We called it quits around 5700' because it was getting late, we were getting tired, and beyond that point the trail appeared completely snowcovered to the PCT junction. \
\
It snowed a little on the way down, but we dodged the rain entirely, and were back at the car around 8:30, exhausted and ready for a chicken strip dinner at Denny's.  Looking forward to going back in nicer weather since the views would be pretty spectacular.  Really nice ridge-walk.  We had snowshoes and ice axes but didn't need them for the 7+ miles of trail we covered. \
\
Note: We stopped to check out the damage on White Chuck Road.  At the first washout there is now a muddy trail heading uphill, which I assume is hiking/biking bypass.  No idea if it's possible to get further down the road."
"colchuck-peak","TR:  Colchuck Col","This weekend I was itching to get outside after spending many weekends in my office.  The weather looked like it did, so I headed to the east side with Matt DePies.  On Saturday night we drove to Leavenworth and slept in the parking lot at the Stuart Lake Trailhead.   I got to try my bivy sack in the rain, which I must say worked surprisingly well.  \
\
Saturday we got up and were walking and reached Colchuck Lake in about 2 hours.  The trail is snow free all the way to the lake.  The sky was such that we kept believing it might clear, just a tease.  Stopping at the lake to eat and drink, we looked up only to see the lower half of Colchuck and Dragontail.  The rest was in the clouds.  Matt was excited to ski the glacier so he skinned up and I followed the boot track (snow was great for kicking steps).  The weather was very strange.  One minute I was overheating in the sun, the next it's snowing and the wind was howling.  We made good time up to the col where we huddled behind a large boulder to eat.  We debated going to the summit, but it was still buried in the clouds as it had been all day so we decided against it.    Matt skied down ~2400 ft from the col to the lake and I followed with a great glissade.   Matt said the snow was good and enjoyed his ski immensely.  From the lake, it was a quick walk through sun and drizzle back to the car.  After a quick stop  at the authentic Bavarian Subway we headed back to Seattle.  After seeing it in person, I need to go back and climb the NBC on Colchuck.  All in all a great day."
"index","Rainy Day Aiding 5/30","The rain started coming down hard just after Monroe, but I didn't have a partner to tell excuses to, so I kept driving.  The Lower Town Wall parking lot was empty when I got there sometime before 11am.  I took my time sorting gear and the sky dried up momentarily, my cue to get climbing.  City Park was dripping, oozing, sopping wet and I forgot my dumptruck full of chalk.  What to do?  Climb it anyway!  What else is raingear for?\
\
I had just bought a Soloist self-belay device and wanted to try it out.  City Park, with a convenient bolt ladder from which to make an anchor, was the ideal pitch to play around on.  I also had some fancy kneepads to try out, so I strapped them to my legs, shouldered the rack, and squished up the free move to the bolt ladder.  My left kneepad immediately fell off.  Pssh.  So much for Arc'teryx quality... no wonder they were on sale.\
\
I climbed slowly, wetly, up the bolts, ripped off the other recalcitrant kneepad, and tossed a nut into the crack.  The Soloist was feeding rope nicely.  I clipped the nut to the rope, pulled up slack, and weighted the rope to test the Soloist.  Ok, it works.  I gradually got into the ol' aid climbing rhythm.  After a couple of pieces, I clipped my cam hook to an aider and started alternating hook moves with gear placements.  City Park is perfect for the medium Leeper cam hook!\
\
I bounce-tested everything because I am a chicken, so despite all the camhooking, I moved slowly.  At the top, I fixed the rope, unclipped the Soloist, and rapped down the free end, cleaning as I went.  A couple of my nuts were stuck, so I left them after much yanking and dinking around with the nut tool.  On the ground, I got out my ascender/prusik combo and jugged up the free end to the stuck nuts.  Using the hefty aluminum Soloist as a hammer, I pounded out both nuts, now looking much the worse for wear.  At the top again, I threaded the chains and rappelled a second time.  3h15m to do all that... wow, I need more practice.  Thank goodness I don't need a belayer anymore for this stuff.\
\
The sun and the rain played tag with each other all day, so I was alternately rainy and sweaty.  Annoyed with how long it took me to climb one frickin' easy aid pitch (one that I'd climbed before, no less), I looked for redemption.  Motivation was low today, as it is most days lately.  I settled on the Thin Fingers approach, which had been the first pitch I'd aided, back in the day with Jon Jantz and Gary \""Norwegian Sheep Lover\"" Yngve.  It took me two hours and two belayers back then, but this time I got myself fired up.  I top-stepped, camhooked, freeclimbed, and reached the anchor in no time.  Rap, jug, clean six pieces, and rap back down.  One hour, including time to sling a boulder at the base for my lead anchor.\
\
Somewhat satisfied, I packed up and scanned the walls, looking for booty gear.  There was a locking biner at the Iron Horse pins, but I couldn't be bothered.  The rain was starting to annoy me.  Stern Farmer was lookin' good and I resolved to come back another rainy day and aid that one.\
\
There was some kind of big to-do on Highway 2 when I got back to my car, with sirens screaming up and down across the river.  I drove back on Reiter Road, quite the scenic drive, with good views of Mts. Index and Persis, followed by roadside redneck campsites and mudbogging wastelands.\
\
A glorious sunny sky was open over Seattle when I got to the 520 bridge, so I pulled off for some action at the UW rock to finish off a good day of climbing."
"Mount-rainier","Rainier 5/29-5/30","Failed on Rainier for the third time this year last weekend.  0 for 6 now overall, What was I thinking?\
\
This report is for my Dad, the suffer machine.  Went to Camp Shurman straight up the Inter Glacier last Saturday with my Dad and roomate.  Lots of soft, wet, snow despite high winds and a relatively low freezing level.  Something like 20 people headed for either Liberty Ridge or Shurman turned around on the Inter Glacier and headed home that day as clouds made for reduced visibility above 7500, and the snow made the going slow.   \
\
Followed five rangers up to the camp however, who kicked steps making the way a little easier, showed the fastest way off Steamboat Prow down into camp, and gave us hot water when we came in about 8pm.  These rangers, I would imagine, as they were settling in for a long stay when we were there, were the group of five who tried to get to the latest fatality on Liberty Ridge.  They did say that some of them had participated in the rescue a few weeks ago.  Set up our three-season Sierra Designs next to a Bibler I-tent in a large pit dug in the snow.  We also would have had the comfort of a four-season tent, but someone checked out one of the club's without telling anybody, and the other I-tent had been spending an inordinate amount of time in Norway lately.  My roommate requested that he not have to spend the night in a tent with a member of my family so he got the third-person accomodation, my bivy sack.\
\
During the night the wind was gusting pretty hard, and although it had stopped snowing, the wind was drifting snow into the pit that the two tents and bivy sack were in.  My roommate bolted from the bivy sack during the night when he refused to try and keep up with the incoming snow, and ended up in the tent with both Zabriskie guys after all.  This is the worst weather I've ever been in a tent for, and the first time I've ever had to use a pee bottle as going outside just wasn't an option.  It was much clearer in the morning, but still windy, and we dug everything out while enjoying brief views of the mountain.  The snow was still incredibly soft and made travel about impossible away from the rocks of Steamboat Prow, and the weather was not promising as the clouds continued to roll in and obscure the views we had.  We were planning on staying the day in camp for a summit attempt during prescribed better weather Sunday night, but we packed up and left along with the only other party there, two skiers in the bibler next to us.  \
\
A hole got knocked in my pot while being cleaned from the previous nights noodle mess, so we were unable to melt water for the descent, that sucked, but we had about a half-liter water each, which got us down.   Roped up on the way down the Inter Glacier as there were some large crevasses on the way up, there were no tracks left, and we were in a whiteout.  Leading off down the glacier in poor visibility was pretty surreal and made for incredibly easy disorientation and vertigo; had to constantly look back at the rope trailing off into the mist behind me to get some perspective.  Was able to avoid the few large, open crevasses and as soon as were unroped at the base of the glacier I made my way as fast as I could to the running water in Glacier Basin.   Saw some very slow and wet slides coming off Mt. Ruth as we left, interesting to see the mechanics of an avalanche when it was moving so slowly.  It was nice and sunny back in the lowlands, great for drying gear, I don't think I'll be headed back to Rainier for a while."
"Guye-peak","TR: Guye Peak South Spur","In an attempt to enjoy the good weather and improve my conditioning, I hatched plans for a Guye Peak, Snoqualmie Mountain, Lundin Peak traverse.  I started up the South Spur of Guye at the alpine hour of 10AM.  Mostly tried to stay on the spur, which was doable everywhere except the bottom.  At the toe there is some sportclimber steep rock that I'm suprised isn't covered in bolts yet.  Lower down, the moss covering the holds was still pretty wet, giving it that sponge climbing feel.  Higher up, some interesting, steep, pine needle- covered dirt climbing was encountered.  The axe was handy there.  This was followed by several truly delightful rock steps with warm, dry, solid rock featuring positive holds.  The traverse across the 3 sub-peaks was fun, as always.  At the top, I determined that I was out of condition, so I ate my salami and headed home.  So much Cascade flavor, so close to the road...."
"leavenworth-area-climbs","Leavenworth","Went east to dry land on Saturday with Foraker from CC.com.  Started out at Castle Rock where we did Catapult on the lower Rock up to Canary.  Took my first trad lead fall getting out onto Saber Ledge right at the top of the first pitch of Canary, good to have the experience, even better that it was clean, but I never want to do that again.  I rested for a minute and got onto the ledge cleanly the next time. Foraker followed but had had it after climbing the first pitch, so we left Castle Rock and went over to Givler's Dome and climbed Givler's Crack.  An enjoyable route, but I'm just glad I don't have to walk all the way back there ever again.  Good times."

\
Scott and I planned a post finals climbing trip here is the breakdown\
\
thursday- 10:30 swich destinations from squamish to leavenworth due to weather.  Noon I finally get my stuff together and we head off to leavenworth.  Some time later arrive in leavenworth.  Ask Scott what he would rather due hit up castle or carnival crack.  Despite being a born and bread sport climber Scott loves the OW so Carnival it is.  Much failing on tr followed, my right leg still has a cramp.  After being a good spanking we head over to alphabet rock.  Scott leds dogleg and the 5.10 bolted face to its right.  I tr both before moving the tr over to the z crack which is a fun route.  Maybe someday I will have the balls to lead it.\
\
Friday- wake up late heard over to castle.  Wander over to lower castle since your not allowed to climb at castle without climbing up lower castle to get to the upper part.  Because there are somemany good routes at lower castle and hiking your not here to go hiking are you?  Hmmm what to do, I want to try brass balls but its kinda scary looking.  Scott wants to do the Bone since I told him and everyone else I know its the coolest route ever, which it is.  So Scott leads the bone agreeing that it is the sickest 5.9 ever.  You know when your bouldering you bust a heel hook out and your like this would be sweet 3 pitches of the deck well you do that on the bone.  I then make up for my day of tr'ing on thursday by leading angel, fun, Damination, super fun but scary coming off the half way ledge, and crack o doom.  A while ago when Paul and I went to Castle we climbed o Grey Mare which is the approach pitch to Crack o Doom and then I had to down climb this 5th class gulley protected by tr of a fix pin since there was are no anchors.  It was nice to see the fix pin is no longer in service.  Anyway Crack o Doom is also super fun, though not as fun as the bone.  Anyway i thought it was going to be a fist crack but it wasn't -1 point but Its was more sustaind than I thought it would be/looks +2.  \
\
Top out on castle realize its my birthday and now time to get drunk.  Head over to Gustavs enjoy my first beer in a restaraunt.  Then go on a search for some hard A.  End up running all over 11worth literally before making it to the liquor store right as the door is closing, phewww good thing we didn't have to break in cause i only get to do this once.  Purchase a 1/5 of sky valley voldaka which tastes like cough sryurp until your drunk and head back to the bivy.  Light a fire and good to work, somebody comes over and gives me a beer.  Two hours later we have kicked the voldaka and beer.  Scott doing a little bit better than me manages to literally drag me over to my sleeping bag.  \
\
Saturday- Its 1:30pm before I can get solid food down and Scott has a head ache most of the day.  We both feel better after dinner but no climbing today.\
\
Sunday- Starts raining in the middle of the night.  In the morning its not to bad, we cook breakfast and debat what to do\

head over to the swift water bouldering area, look at the v4 i tried last time its wet, head over to the roof crack, try a v3 near it, it's not going today.  Work on the roof crack, move onto another probelm.  Decent progress is made if you consider the fact that my ass got 3 inches off the ground on the start and I showed Scott how to do the last move.  Another party shows up, I try the roof crack again with encouragement and get it up to the soaking wet finishing moves which is good enough for me, today.  We head home.  On the way home its stops raining; by the time we hit index it looks dry but Scott says simply \""I'm doing us both and favor\"" and keeps driving.  I don't protest.\
\
Fun trip though not much climbing as i would have liked.  Its going to be along time before i drink that much hard a again."
,"New routes at X38 Far Side","After five weeks of sitting on my ass recovering from a shoulder injury, my professional medical opinion was that my recovery was well advanced, and my mental health needed an outing before I went insane.\
\
I headed up to the Far Side at X38 on Saturday with Andy (Rainier partner), Ben (ice climbing partner), Melissa (IMA gym co-worker), and Katherine (recovering from wisdom teeth extraction).  We found some dry rock up at the Headlight Point/Eastern Block area, as well as some new routes.\
\
The last time I had been up there I was disappointed to see that the 5.10a  \""Ellie's Sweet Kiss,\"" (really a 5.<!-- s8) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cool.gif\"" alt=\""8)\"" title=\""Cool\"" /><!-- s8) --> had been chopped, or at least the hangers had been stripped from the bolts.  That climb is pretty fun.  Now they are back on, although the first one is loose and shaky, so don't fall on it.   I was also interested to see that four new routes are up now, next to that route.  I climbed 3 of them.  The one to the left of ESK is short and interesting, maybe 5.10a (not inflated Far Side rating), the one to the right of it has a 5.9 move and is reasonably fun, and the next one to the right is plagued with slopers and run-out fourth class.  Maybe 5.8?  I did not climb the rightmost new route, since it looked short and slopy.\
\
There are also new routes on the upper face opposite the routes in the cave which look like they might be interesting.  It was a good day for booty gear- two lockers, two draws, and two sewn runners.  It felt good to get in eight routes after growing fat and weak for too long, although the ratings there are too much to really get my hopes up.  Strategic Placement 5.11a?  I am dubious.  \

Get well soon, Ralph!"

"Mount-rainier","TR: Mount Rainier - Emmons Glacier 6/17/2004","Went out to Camp Sherman Wednesday with Jim. Made good time from the parking lot to camp in 5 hours. Woke up just after midnight under clear skies to begin the ascent. Jim was a bit dehydrated and decided to forgo the summit attempt so I joined a couple guys from Atlanta, GA heading up the mountain. \
\
Snow conditions at night and early morning were good for cramponing. Ascent was fairly straightforward up the corridor and zig zags abit to the Winthrop to avoid crevasses on the Emmons. No trench like the DC, but a noticeable tread through the snow. At the upper bergshrund, you can still basically head straight up. The traverse out to the saddle between Liberty cap and the summit crater to avoid the bergshrund is not necessary yet. The upper 1500 feet of the mountain was icy in sections, but nothing out of the ordinary. Summited at the true summit at 6:30 and chilled on the summit and by the registry just inside the crater for an hour and a half. Winds all the way up were relatively light. We did the aforementioned traverse on the way down and it was more time consuming, but the glissade down the entire corridor, about 2,000 feet, made up for lost time! \
\
One the guys on my rope team actually had his camera become loose and slide down the Winthrop Glaicer out of sight. Miraculously, when we did the traverse around the bergshrund we found it lying precariously next to a crevasse! It had jumped over a number of giant crevasses including the bergshrund. He was able to retrieve it, some kind of luck! I packed up camp and left Sherman just after noon. I wanted to continue the glissade down the inter glacier, but by noon it had become a slush pile so I was forced to post-hole my way most of the way down, arriving happily at the car at 2:30. Overall, a pretty standard Emmons Glacier ascent in spectacular weather. The lights of the Seattle metro area at night and the bright alpenglow will be memorable aspects of this trip. \
\
We heard helicopters flying around all morning and met several backcountry rangers searching for a long overdue Liberty Ridge party. My prayers go out to these climbers and I hope they will be found soon."
"South-early-winters-spire","beautiful days at SEWS","I climbed South Early Winter Spire (via Southwest Rib) with my friend Adam on Sunday.\
The weather was absolutely stellar at Washington pass both sat and sun.  \
\
The trail was melted out all the way to the climbers trail breakoff from the Blue Lake trail.  then patchy snow for about 300 ft elevation, then solid snow.  The snow made for a nice ascent and descent (by newly improved standing glissade technique <!-- s:twisted: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_twisted.gif\"" alt=\"":twisted:\"" title=\""Twisted Evil\"" /><!-- s:twisted: --> )  \
\
We drove up on Saturday getting to the trailhead at 8:00 a.m. After the hike in, on really frozen snow (step kicking gets about 1.5 inches of step), we find one party on the route and seven roping up for it.  Oh well, my first time at the Pass...so we simul-climbed the south arete route and had I one of the best naps of my life on the summit.  being lazy, we downclimbed the arete and hiked out.  back at camp,  lounge for many hours.  Nice.\
\
Sunday, we were back for the Southwest rib.  1.5 hours got us to base.  1 party, 3 pitches up.  No probelm.  We took the west face variation (one 200' pitch roughly 5.6) up the 5.8 crack.The 5.8 \""crux\"" pitch seemd a bit soft for 5.8, although the exposure was fantastic.  Very clean crack.  a 40 ft \""pitch\"" of 5.5, a 4th class ledge and then exposed somewhat-protected 5.6 friction got us to the belay block below the bear-hug pitch.  Can't complain at all about the friction part, after all it is alpine-rock.  The bear-hug pitch was no problem.  Bring a #4 camalot, better if you had 2, but it not that hard for 5.7+.  A couple meandering pitches brought us to the famed \""rabbit ears\"" which was a bit too high on the route.  We should have traversed into the gully lower.  However, a fairly-new piece of webbing was around the right ear, so we rapped off it into the gulley and scrambed to the final pitch.  We soloed the final 20ft of 5.2 crack to the summit.  The summit views were totally amazing, the best I've ever seen.  Wow, the North Cascade are awesome.\
\
base to summit time 4 hours + 1 hour for the South Arete downclimb.   \
\
All in all, I would recommend the route, especially to the aspiring alpine rock climber.  It was a pretty mellow 7 pitches and a good intro for me to washington pass rock.  I can't wait to get back there for some harder stuff.  Anybody?"

"Mount-rainier","TR: Mount Rainier via Kautz Glacier, 6/17-6/19","Dustin Shigeno, Kira Misura, Jeff Crowe, Gary Yngve, and I spent 3 days on Mount Rainier and summited on Saturday via the Kautz Glacier route.\
\
We drove down to Paradise Thursday morning, arriving there at 9.30am. After talking to the rangers and signing in we sorted our gear and were on our way by 10:30am to walk up to near Panorama Point. From there we dropped down to the Nisqually Glacier where we roped up and crossed the glacier. There where only a few hair thin crevasses open and crossing the glacier was straightforward. We then ascended the prominent chute on the other side and continued up the ridge to the foot of the Wilson Glacier and on north along a ridge line. Overly precautious, we where still roped up which made travel a little cumbersome since we sometimes stayed on the ridge but went on snow when the ridge became too difficult to walk on, especially with crampons and plastic boots.  However, on the snow we would post hole frequently and then return to the rock. After ascending the Turtle snowfield we arrived around 7pm at an ok camp site at 10.500ft, below Camp Hazard, where we pitched the tent and bivy sacks and started melting snow, eating dinner and going to bed.\
\
The next day, Friday, was our rest day which we spend in camp, melting snow, eating, enjoying the gorgeous views of Adams, St Helens, Hood, and Jefferson, listening to music, reading books, or simply hang out. It was great to have a day where we actually didn't do anything.  We could oversee the Muir snow field from Paradise nearly all the way to Camp Muir.  It was lined with groups of little black moving dots.  On the next day this would change to a continuous line of people travelling to Camp Muir... Jeff surprised us with some delicious Alaska river salmon and bread that he had carried all the way up to 10.500ft!  He also found a piece of glass and some metal that seemed to have been part of a helicopter that crashed there a few years ago.  Well fed and rested we retired early. \
\
Our planned alpine start for the summit climb was supposed to be 2am in the morning. However, during the night the wind had picked up and nobody felt like leaving there sleeping bags and we postponed until 3am. Since the wind was still pretty strong we postponed again to 4am. Finally, at 5am we were ready to start climbing.  This reminded me of a very late start (4am) Dustin and I had from Camp Schurman last year... It was pretty cold so that our water bottles froze in the packs. We reached Camp Hazard just below the Kautz ice cliff at 6:30am. At this point, Jeff decided to turn around since he had fallen in camp and his knees and hands where pretty bashed up. \
\
According to the route description, one descends from Camp Hazard east via a gully that is prone to ice and rock fall in order to gain the snow chute on the left of the ice cliff. We didn't do this. Instead we traversed the gully without dropping down to gain the snow chute. The four of us where tied together and Gary lead out. This method probably saved us at least an hour. The snow in the chute was very nice for step kicking. We placed pickets for running belays for about 2 pitches until the chute flattened out. After gaining the ridge between the Nisqually and Kautz Glaciers we followed a well travelled path to reach the saddle between Point Success and the summit crater at 14.000 ft around 11.15am.  On the way, we only saw 2 or 3 crevasses that where open and we had to step over.  After taking an extended rest break we gained the crater rim at noon. The weather was still nice with some clouds occasionally blowing in and out. Since it was already pretty late we only spend about 15 minutes on the crater rim to take some pictures before we started heading down. The descent was unspectacular until we reached the step snow chute. Here, we down climbed the steep part which was no fun because our crampons kept bailing up. The procedure took considerable time. When we did the traverse back to Camp Hazard below the ice cliffs some small rocks came raining down. Nothing happened, but everybody was relieved when we finally unroped in Camp Hazard at 3pm. There seems to be a reason that some people recommend being up and down that part before 10am in order to limit the danger of ice and rock fall...\

We arrived in camp 15 minutes later to pack our stuff and descend to the trail head. For some reason a little snow storm descended on us (in mid-June) but it went away as quickly as it came. Go figure... We plunge stepped and glissaded our way down the mountain.  We also didn't care to rope up for the Nisqually Glacier crossing. Everybody was tired but we still had to climb up 500ft out of the glacier. Arrived at the parking lot after 7pm, battled bad traffic on I-5, and arrived back in town at 10pm.\
\
This was a great climb. The Kautz Glacier route is less travelled than the DC or Emmons Glacier routes. It is an interesting and very scenic route with a bit of everything: glacier crossings, ridges, a cool looking ice cliff, and a fairly step snow chute.  The latter makes this a grade II-III route, but the chute is not bad at all.  We used 4 pickets and carried a few ice screws but didn't use them.  Spending a rest day at high camp was great: Nobody in our team got any altitude related problems to speak of. It was great to not just reach the summit but also being able to enjoy it.\

"eldorado-peak","TR: Eldorado 6/20/04","My old climbing buddy Nathan from my days in California was in town, and I thought that a trip to either the Pickets or the Eldorado icecap would be the best way to convince him that the Cascades kick the Sierra's ass.  After deciding that 2 1/2 days wouldn't be enough to do justice to the Pickets, we headed up the cascade river road on Friday morning in search of awesome relief and broken ice.  We left the Eldorado parking lot around 11AM and were at the rib above the Eldorado glacier by 3:00.  The talus field was completely snow free, but we found some nice sloppy snow in the upper Eldorado creek drainage.  The original plan was to continue up to the Inspiration glacier, climb Primus and Austera Saturday and Eldorado Sunday on the way out, but we were feeling lazy, and faced with the opportunity for alpenglow on Johannesburg, we decided to set up camp.  We spend about 4 hours staring at Cascade Pass area peaks and Glacier peak (better than must-see TV!), ate some dehydrated \""pasta and meat sauce\"" left over from Nathan's Aconcagua trip last fall and went to bed around 9:30.  Despite our full awareness of the weather pattern and its implication for snow conditions, we slept in until about 8:30 on Saturday morning for a solid 11 hours of sleep (did I mention we were feeling lazy?).  After a quick breakfast, we postholed to our knees up the east ridge of Eldorado, enjoying the phenomenal views of the North Ridge of Forbidden and Moraine lake.  The upper margin of the Inspiration Glacier still seemed pretty stable and we elected not to rope up.  We arrived around 11:15 at the base of the summit ridge, where we waited ~45 minutes for two older gentlemen to belay the knife edge.  Great opportunity for photos and a short session of \""Name-That-Peak\"".  Once they cleared out, we took our turn on the knife edge, which was very sloppy on the south, but seemed firm and sufficiently stable on the north.  I was surprised how short the runout segment of the ridge is.  Because of a combination of laziness and the sloppy postholey snow, we decided to return to camp rather than explore the depths of the ice cap; we arrived back at the camp ridge around 2PM and spent another 7 hours staring at the view.  A few more sunset photos and another night of going to sleep before dark and waking up after dawn and we were ready for the mercifully brief yet bonejarringly steep descent of the Eldo trail to the car.  An Elkburger and milkshake in Marblemount rounded out the trip nicely.\
\
This was my first trip to this area, and I am looking forward to taking another shot at the full Icecap traverse with a little more planning about snow conditions."
"Ptarmigan-traverse","TR:  Ptarmigan Traverse, June 17-20, 2004","w/ Phil Higuera\
               \
In his book \""The Best Ski Touring in America\"" Steve Barnett makes an off-handed comment about \""deep, jungle filled holes\"" when comparing valleys in the Western Cascades to those east of the crest.  The line has become somewhat of a legend amongst our friends, and whenever I have a commanding view of a deep Cascadian valley, especially one without a trail, I can't help but think \""wow, that's some impressive jungle filled hole down there.\""  One of the many virtues of the Ptarmigan Traverse is that it manages to avoid travel in any of these holes, except of course for the exit, mile after never ending mile, but we'll get to that.\
\
Truth be told, this wasn't the first choice for a high route this spring, as I had just walked the traverse for the second time last fall.  The snow pack, weather and our work schedules conspired to make it the only feasible choice however.  The high country along the route is superlative and skiing is always a drastically different experience than walking, so we shouldered our heavy packs and started the trek from the Cascade River Road Thursday morning.  Unfortunately, the car shuttle and shenanigans with the workers starting repair work on the road conspired to push our departure time back to 10 am.  We had hoped to make it to Spider-Formidable col the first night, but with this late start and precious 4 hours of sleep the night before, it was not to be.\
 \
From Cascade Pass we skied a short distance into Pelton Basin and climbed a snow gully to the Cache Glacier instead of making the steep traverse across Mixup Arm.  Above 6500 ft on the glacier we ran into recent snow;  it wasn't too soft on skis, but was fairly rotten, with our poles penetrating several feet.  In the fall, Cache Col is protected by a moat and a hundred feet of steep mud, but in the spring it is nothing more than a gentle snow slope, buried under many feet of snow.  By the time we arrived at the col after 5400 ft of climbing, it was mid-afternoon and the sky was beginning to look fairly ominous.  The weather forecast when we left called for sunny skys on Thursday, but \""I'll be damned if those clouds don't look like rain clouds,\"" I thought.  We skied down below Cool Aid Lake, then climbed past the lake to make a descending traverse over towards Red Ledge.  The ledge itself was mostly snow covered, with a section melted out;  a steep gully bypassed most of the ledge, but it too was partly melted out.  Is that snow rotten?  The entire prospect looked a bit too unsavory for our tastes, so we instead climbed some brush and a snow gully on climbers right to gain the ridge above.  By this time it was approaching early evening, and the clouds overhead were starting to grow worrisome.  Sheets of rain were falling to our south and west, but were re-evaporating in the dry lower atmosphere before hitting the ground.  Occasionally, a few sprinkles would touch down.  We decided to make camp instead of pressing on.  That evening we were treated to a fiery sunset behind Johannesburg, some impressive god rays through the isolated rain squaws and a lightning and thunder display to our south west.  \""Sunny?\""  Hum, something was amiss with the forecast.\
 \
Friday dawned crystal clear, and after enjoying the view of Formidable and Spider over breakfast, we made a descending traverse below the Middle Cascade Glacier.  The talus here was melted out, but we didn't mind as the beaten trail made for easy upward progress.  We skinned up the glacier to the col, then made a long descending traverse to Yang Yang Lakes.  A steep snow gully gave access to the arm below Le Conte.  By this time, dark clouds had again billowed up, and appeared to be raining to our north.  The snow hadn't refrozen over night, was quite rotten and we were concerned about the steep traverse to gain access to the Le Conte Glacier.  A clap of thunder sounded and we paused to weigh our options.  I desperately wanted to make it past the Le Conte Glacier on Friday, both to climb Old Guard which I hadn't previously done on either of my trips, and to give us an opportunity to ski Dome the following day.  It began to snow, and in a moment of weakness perhaps, we decide to stay put.\
\
Saturday morning, after cramponing up Le Conte arm, we made a long descending traverse on softening snow, then roped up at the base of the Le Conte Glacier.  I knew we'd be walking across what later in the season are gaping crevasses, so the rope seemed prudent.  The snow on the lower glacier only superficially re-froze, and was soft and rotten below the thin surface crust.  This surely would would have been very soft the previous afternoon we consoled ourselves.  We arrived at the Sentinel - Le Conte col without incident and took in the view of the South Cascade Glacier.  The entire Ptarmigan is spectacular, but the section from the Le Conte Glacier to the Dana Glacier is perhaps the nicest, and my favorite.  As we arrived at the col above White Rock Lakes, I swear I heard Phil's jaw drop.  All at once, and for the first time in the tour, one can see the entire cirque from the Chickamin Glacier over to Spire Point in one unbroken wall of ice and rock.  The curiously perched Gunsight; the heaving mass of the Chickamin, broken beyond belief, reminiscent of a drying lava flow as it runs into the slabs and rubble above over its long tongue;  Dome and Elephant Head aligned in the center, their twin forms anchoring the scene;  the twin lobes of the Dana Glacier, and finally the improbably sharp Spire Point.  Below snow line, the most impressive jungle filled hole of the trip, Agnes Creek, gracefully arcs out of view.  It is one of the most spectacular views in the Cascades, forever protected by days of work and toil, and a previous generation of thoughtful, hard working politicians and conservationists.\
 \
We made some fine turns down to White Rock Lakes, then traversed below the Dana Glacier and climbed to Spire Col.  The climb was very hot - at one point Phil stopped to roll in the snow - but soon enough we arrived at the col to nice views of Glacier Peak.  We took a break for some food, and I told Phil what I knew about the original Ptarmigans.  We skied down to Itswoot Ridge and made camp in one of the more scenic camps I've seen.  Phil took a run towards Dome, while I contently sat and watched clouds blow past the peaks.\
               \
After packing up on Sunday morning, we skied and hiked out.  We were able to ski down to Cub Lake, then climb to the Bachelor Creek divide on mostly bare trail, before skiing down to the gigantic slide path in Bachelor Creek.  Here we packed the skis for the last time and began the brush battle.  The trail in Bachelor Creek has fallen into disrepair; we cursed the brush and downfall until finally arriving at Downey Creek.  In one particularly annoying alder thicket, Phil wondered out loud what it must have been like for the pioneers.  Did they carry machetes?  I replied simply, \""They were harder in those days.\""  We switched to running shoes for the final hike out Downey Creek, down what must be the longest 6 miles in the entire range.  Most of the trail here is in fine shape, but the riparian zones are overgrown.  As I pushed through a particularly thick section of thorny bushes and devils club high over the tops of my skis, I more than once heard Phil snicker, \""hehe, jungle filled holes.\"","",""0"
"leavenworth-area-climbs","Learning about crack in Leavenworth","This past Saturday Matt DePies and I headed to Leavenworth to practise some trad leading.  Both of us are pretty new to it so we decided to stick to easier climbs.   We climbed a nameless 5.6 hand crack at Barney's Rubble, a 5.4 off-width and a 5.5 hand crack at the Roto Wall, and Gibson's Crack (5.5) on the Mountaineer's Dome.  I personally did not have much experience climbing cracks and so this was a new experience for me.   Gibson's Crack seemed surprisingly hard for 5.5, but that could be because I haven't climbed many cracks and we only had pro to 1.5\"" instead of 3\"" like the guide book said.  Has anyone else climbed this? I'm just curious as to what other people think of this climb.   All in all the day was a lot of fun, but I have a lot to learn about climbing cracks."
"prusik-peak","Prusik Peak W Ridge 6/28-29.","The first lesson in The Mountaineers' Cairn Building Course is \""One rock does not a cairn make.\""\
\
My friend Andy Lewis and I enjoyed some tranquil solitude, magnificent rock, and perfect conditions on a midweek climb of this Alpine Lakes moderate classic.\
\
Monday morning we drove out to Leavenworth, had no trouble picking up permits, and visited our friends at Leavenworth Mountain Sports.  By 2:30 we were on the hot, dusty trail up Snow Creek.  It was toasty, we each drank five liters of water on the approach.  The last thousand feet was marked by the ubiquitous cairn.  There must have been one every twenty feet, and cement steps had been poured on some of the granite slabs.  Just in case you couldn't figure out which way to go.\
\
We camped at Lake Vivian, having arrived in five hours.  It was a beautiful clear night with a gentle breeze to keep the bugs down.  During dinner a few curious ugopies approached, but didn't venture too close.\
\
They were back in the morning, waking us at 5:30.  Perfect timing.  Hiking by 6:30, we took a leisurely route around the west side of the lake and up the north side of Prusik Pass.  The clear, still day was perfect for climbing.  We scrambled up to a ledge, and Andy took the gear, setting off up the ridge.  I took over at the belay, and soon reached the fixed pin on the north side.  I was tempted to keep going and lead the unprotected 5.7 slab, but was glad I didn't, because I would have run out of rope.  The next pitch was quality, the airy moves over the south face were really fun.\
\
On the west side of the summit block I found a shiny new bolt, that was a bit of a surprise.  Up the chimney and we were on the summit.  Gorgeous views.  On the north face descent I found two new stoppers and two biners.  There was a nice looking Tech Friend on the W Ridge that was pretty well sunk.  Andy didn't want to mess around trying to clean it, so if you go up there soon you might have a shot at some good booty.\
\
Our hike back to camp was much quicker, we pulled our packs out of the tree, and cruised down in four hours with a few good laughs along the way:\
\
Andy:  Check out this cairn.  It's like it was done in a cubic style so you can see all sides of it from no matter which angle you look at it.  \
Nick:  You could even call it \""Cairnica.\"" \

,"A First Free Ascent!","Well, it seems to be fashionable these days to write trip reports where people end up in the hospital, so here goes:\
\
Bryce and I had been planning this secret project for several months now. Early last week we felt that the conditions were finally turning favorable, so we got our gear ready.  Since we didn't know what to expect on this uncharted route, we erred on the side of carrying too much. During the last day in basecamp, we tried to keep calm and not let on our anxiety to each other. This was going to be big, more difficult and dangerous than anything we'd ever done before, and completing this project would mean the dream of our lifetime coming true.  The best thing to do in such a case is to act as if nothing special was going on. \
We started late Tuesday evening, and the approach took a full 24 hours. We moved steadily with short rests but no break for sleep. It was of the utmost importance to get into a rhythm before we started on the vertical part of the ascent. Then, at midnight on June 30th, we got to the base of the wall. A full moon was calmly lighting the sky, and we took that as a good omen. I quickly led up the first three pitches, but from here the climbing was getting increasingly demanding. We moved methodically upwards, but progress seemed agonizingly slow when we pondered the huge challenge that was still looming overhead. \
\
Here the analogy kind of ends, because if it really was a climb, I would've turned around at that point. But no, my friends, this was childbirth, and you don't get to make that kind of decision. I had thought it would be manageable because I'm so tough and skilled, not to speak of my legendary determination. Not so! Quite preposterous, in fact. It was the most mind-boggling agony, desperation, and moment of truth.  This is what you get for trying the free ascent, but it is so much more rewarding than aid. When it was over, I was overwhelmed with awe and happiness at this new little human. No need for sleep, or sanity. Now, four days later, I'm finally starting to feel normal again. \

Maximilian Yoshi Gust-Anderson was born at 7:12am on July 1st (his due date!) at the UW Medical Center. He weighed 7 pounds 10 ounces, measured 20 3/4 inches in length, and is awfully cute. You can call him Max, and he'll be out climbing around as soon as his legs will carry him. For now though, he'll just be content staring at all the odd things this world has to offer, and digesting his milk. \
\
I'll post some pictures as soon as I get around to it, which may be a little while."
,"New routes at Gun Show and Little Si","On Sunday I headed out to the Far Side with Jeremy Bowler from the IMA Climbing Center to check out the recently bolted lines at the Gun Show crag.  We climbed three of the four (?) new routes there, all were enjoyable.  Two of them have second pitches, or can be linked as one long pitch.  The rightmost of these was our favorite.  It started on a steepish face with abundant juggy holds, wove through a little fourth class and over a block to the chains, and the second pitch was a fun moderate face.  The addition of these routes makes that little crag a worthwhile destination beyond the attraction of the 40m slab climb.\
\
Monday I went to Little Si with Ryan, Marcie, and Chris, the first full climbing reunion of our 2002-2003 New Hampshire ice climbing trip.  We found a couple newish routes at the left side of the British Aisles, both of which were fun.  The left one was about 5.8, the right one was low 5.10.  After some flogging on steep and thin elevens at Greenland we decided we were sufficiently tired and bailed."
"Mount-redoubt","TR: Mount Redoubt - Redoubt Glacier, July 3-5","[i:1kjpezxs]A long story without pictures because I don't have a digital camera, but I will scan some photos and post them in a few days. [/i:1kjpezxs]\
\
Seven of us packed into two vehicles left the Seattle area around 6 am. We drove up the Depot Creek as far as we could (about 1 mile). It turns out the crux of the road was just above where we parked. Had we continued, the road improved for over a mile before a major washout that is impassable. Fortunately, the weather here was dry and we knew the forecast was calling for an improving trend through Monday. \
\
We saddled our packs and hiked up the road for a mile and a half and then the abandoned logging road for another two miles to the border. After the border, the climbers path runs along Depot Creek meandering up and down in old growth forest for about 3 miles. \
Three miles in from the border, the way begins to ascend to the base of the falls. The “unforgettable” falls with the 8 foot rock step at the base is definitely something I will remember. The wet, slippery rock and mist shooting off the falls definitely makes the move interesting. At the top of the headwall, in which 1,000 feet is gained in a very short distance, the way becomes flat and we say our first view of Redoubt. \
\
After walking through the meadows we ascended the final 1,000 vertical through talus to Ouzel Lake. We camped out at Ouzel Lake the first night. The sky cleared just after sunset, but we found ourselves socked in the following morning. Dampened a bit by the weather, we slept in till 10 am at which point the clouds began to break up. Three members of the group decided to go for Spickard and the rest, including me, went for Redoubt. \
\
Ascending the rock ledges to the foot of the Redoubt Glacier was fun and the right side of the glacier was benign making for a quick trip to the 7,800 foot col just under Redoubt’s massive flying buttress which is almost vertical and even overhanging in some parts. The glacial plateau of the Redoubt Glacier is an amazing setting with Twin peaks, Redoubt, and Spickard across the valley. By this point, the weather had cleared to where we could see the Pickets and other points south. At the col, we decided to wait to climb Redoubt via the south route till Monday morning because we knew the weather was improving and made camp in a small snow bowl sheltered by the rocks. The north face of Bear was especially cool to look at. Just after the sun set, the clouds lowered into the valleys providing us with excellent views. \
\
The night was clear and cold with nearly a full moon providing ample light. The sunrise in the morning was unforgettalbe as all the clouds had disappeared except for a little low valley fog. We began the ascent up the south cirque of Redoubt soon after sunrise stopping to take pictures of the Pickets in the soft morning light. The route up to the summit was fairly straight forward. The gully system was slightly chossy and the final rock section involved some fourth class moves. We made the summit at 9am and chilled until about 10 am reveling at the panorama from the Pickets to Slesse to garibaldi and other points in the BC coast range. After rapping off the summit and down climbing the gully, we found that the snow in the cirque had softened making for great plunge stepping and glissading all the way back to camp.  \
\
We made it back to camp at about 12:30 and packed it up. We cruised down the glacier and took the shortcut down to Depot Creek. The crossing of Depot Creek gave me a rush, especially because I had no poles to give me balance. By the time we made it down to the base of the unforgettable falls, we were all tired. The final 6.5 miles out were definitely forgettable, but renewed energy after the border crossing allowed us to finish the hike out quickly arriving at the car exhausted at 9:15 pm. Pizza in Chilliwack at midnight and back home at 3 am. \
\
The Redoubt/Spickard area is an amazing, wild place. The morning view of the Pickets is the best I have seen in the cascades. All of our cameras got a good workout on this trip! The company on the trip was fun. Thanks for the good times! I will definitely return to the Redoubt/Spickard area in the future and I look forward to getting a close-up view of the Pickets soon."
"Mount-baker","Mt. Baker, Coleman-Deming, July 10-11","Dan and I climbed the Coleman-Deming route on Mt. Baker this past weekend with my employer Dave and our friend Sherlock.  We opted for a later start on Sunday (5.30am on the boot track) and avoided not only crowds on the route but also the freezing rainshower reported by earlier parties on the summit.

"Mount-stuart","Stuarts complete north ridge","Fourth of July weekend sees Josh and I hiking in with idea of bivying at the base and climbing the route in a single push the next day.  For some unkown reason we start up a spur just to the west of the ridge.  After some don't tell your mom about this climbing IE a 15 ft fall 40ft off the belay with only a single nut in which was described as \""in a flaring pod held in by a single crystal\"" on to a half rope used as a single we bail.  Back at camp we realize our mistake but it is nine before find the start of the route and we both know that we can't climb the longest rock route in the state? in terms of vert gained 3000ft with remander of the day.\
\
Fast forward to friday neither Dave or I likes the west side forecast.  I remind him there is a route which I already now the approach to and so we get in our cars and start driving.  Park my truck at ingalls trailhead and drive to mtn creek.  Car Camp.    \
\
Saturday 7am sees dave and I starting to hike.  For the usually reason I'm to scarced and chicken to commit we decided to bivy on route.  We enter the offtrail section of the approach as we work on my new line of jokes \""Your Wife Jokes\""\
\""Your wife is so ugly her gynecologist is my dogs vet\""\
\""Your wife has so much facial hair when you to go out for dinner they call you Mrs.\""\
\""your wife is so ugly she made her brides maides wear moomoos so she could be the prettest one at your wedding\""\
\""your wife is so ugly her ex bf is a gorilla\""....\
I'm so getting my ass kicked one of these days\
\
11am sees us starting the first pitch, the slot reminds me alot of the first pitch of orbit were the idea is to face climb and use chimney tecnhique for assistantce, I clip my pack to my daisy chain.  We then belay a short 30ft traverseing pitch as per new beckey not Daves older Beckey, which is the route description we have. This bypasses a sweet looking crack which Kearney specifically says not to do as it is hard, discontinous and the cause of several injuries.  What follows is a pitch right up their with the Gerdamine pitches.  two thin cracks and face climbing just left of the route then a short traverse over leads to on route stemming an awesome pitch.  We belay two more unnotable 5.7 pitches before Dave leads us on two simul pitches which deposit us at the notch.  \
5pm.  the notch bivy is to good to pass up.  Espically since it has been cloudy and winding all day and the weather appears to be getting worse.  6:30 sees us in our bags and it snowing.  Dave has a lightweight down bag/bivy sac/pad combo while I have a warmer synethic bag/flaked rope combo but no bivy sac just an emergency space blanket over the lower half and a marmot precip over the upper.  It keeps me dry but any movement will knock the rocks holding the space blanket in place off.  At one point I ask Dave to put a rock back on since I cannot move Dave tosses a striaght up nut shot.  It did the trick but I paid the price, Its was long night.\
\
Sunday. 6:30am wake to clear skys YEAH.  take our time melting snow for water, drink some hot chocolate, I fucking love hot chocolate, will the sun to warm us up and melt the rime that formed over night.\
8:30 Dave leads us out on the first of three simul pitches that put us at the base of the Gerdarme. At some point Dave loses his inflatable pad and tells me he has it for 15 years with out popping.  This make me wonder how old Dave really is but has the added effect of making me realize he is the most experienced partner i have. Lunch at the Gerdarme base wait for the remanding rime to fall off.  The Gerdarme pitches are a lot of fun.  We ended up doing it in three pitches as I got bit scarced face climbing on wet lichen after the fist crack and felt a regroup was in order.  Used 3.5 and 4 forged friends work perfectly much better than lugging a costalot up their. After the Gerdarme we belayed 4 pitches to the summit should have just simuled has Nelsons short 5.9 wall felt like a 5.7 hand crack.  Summit at 3:30.  Starting heading down at 4 Dave wants to chill but I want to avoid the stuart descent bivy that seems to plague som many people.  Then the trundle down the cascadian to beer and peanut butter crackers at my truck WORD&gt;\
\
Thoughts on the route.  Upper half is defentaly better.  All in all I thought the route has perhaps a little over hyped.  Still fun but no south face of prussik.  There are only two good pitches on the lower half but it was nice to have done the complete.  Should have stuck to the orginal plan which was to bivy at the base then bust it in a day and descend the sherpa.  Though Dave liked it the way we did it as you never travel over the same terrain twice as he said think about it we started at st lake trailhead and know we are all the over in esmeralda.  Doing it a day is feasible we spent 13hours climbing and definatly could have gone faster had we been hurrying.  I can't believe Paul did this with his Dad thats Awesome.  Dave is a solid partner to have in the mountains having now done one ice and one rock route together."
"snow-creek-wall","Outerspace","Foraker from CC.com and I climbed Outerspace out at Leavenworth Sunday, it was good times.\

We left the trailhead after driving in that morning about 9:30 and got on the first pitch following another party about 11:00.  Foraker was bringing his 2-liter Platypus dromedary and I had a liter of water on me as we were about to start, which would be plenty, but as he was taking one last sip he bit the mouth-piece off of the tube and dropped the bag, almost completely emptying it's contents.  We were committed though and went on up in the 80 degree sunshine with only one liter between us.  \
\
The first few pitches up and on two-tree ledge were fast and easy, but things slowed down at the airy traverse above the ledge.  I led out from above the traverse where I got lost in a sea of chickenheads, watched a pika show me the path of least resistance to the base of the upper headwall crack, and stretched our 50m rope to it's limit getting there.  The first pitch of the crack was pretty sweet but continually turned to off-hands for my huge paws.  We drank the last of the water at Library Ledge, and there was no sign of the planted reading material, leaving the belayer quite bored, but we were smelling victory so we had no misgivings.  Started to lead up the second pitch of the crack when Foraker said to me that some goats and a guy had been wandering around the base of the climb near our packs for some time now, but he assured me that our packs were well out of view on a small ledge.  I looked down about fifteen seconds later to see the guy at the base has found our stuff and was walking off with it so we start shouting at him, but he and our stuff is out of sight in seconds.  In my frustration I drop a .5 camalot straight off the wall, this doesn't make me feel any better,  and we climb fast to the top craving water and hoping our stuff isn't gone.\
\
Finished the climb and had a relatively easy but tedious time walking off the backside.  What do you know our packs are at the base of the wall and we get to them just as a determined goat and her kid are inspecting them.  The unknown pack-grabber apparently just moved our stuff away from the goats and closer to the walk-off, hearty thanks to him.  The goats left to go chew on some packs hanging in a nearby tree, and after some fruitless searching for a green cam, we made our way down to Snow Creek where I spent several minutes trying to rehydrate myself.  I fought leg cramps the rest of the way down anwyay, and cursed the failure of Foraker's platypus.  I myself, lost about a liter of water when the mouthpiece of my Platypus fell down a crevasse last summer on the Boston Glacier, which similarly resulted in leg cramps later on; might I recommend against getting that particular brand.   This was a great climb which I will be sure to go back and do mistake-free in the future."
"liberty-bell-mountain","TR: Liberty Bell via Southwest Face (Beckey Route)","Yesterday I climbed the Beckey route up Liberty Bell with a small Mountaineers party of four.  Since this was a weekday we thought that we would get away with showing up late in the day without encountering too many people.  And indeed, we only met two parties of two during the whole day.\
\
We left Seattle at 5.30am and arrived at the Blue Lake trailhead at Washington Pass around 8.30am.  The weather was great, the mosquitos weren't.  Unfortunately, I had forgotten my half-gallon bottle of bug repellent and became a victim wich was unpleasant.  We hiked up to the notch between Liberty Bell and Concord Tower (everything is melted out by now).  Roped up and started on the route at 11:30am.  Pleasant climbing, 4 pitches, the second and third pitches are 5.6, the other two are easier.  Made the summit two hours later, took our time to eat and enjoy the views, rapelled, and began the descend down the gully.  There is a reason why the gully is sometimes called the \""bowling alley\"":  It's practically impossible to not kick down rocks.  At some point, I inadvertently launched a toaster-sized rock that nearly hit two party members.  I don't even want to imagine what it is like on a sunny weekend when the place turns in what Beckey calls in his book a \""social mecca\""...  Anyway, nobody got hurt and we arrived at the car at 5:30am after a day of great climbing with a group of great people."
"The-tooth","Camping on the Tooth","I had a very pleasant trip camping atop the Tooth.  Except for the mosquitoes.  And because this was supposed to be a mellow, easy, low-planning trip, in my 10 minutes of packing I neglected to pack DEET, long pants, nor long sleeve shirt.  Oops.\

\
In the morning, I saw a party of 3 women heading up there.  They had just climbed Ingalls on Saturday.  Pretty cool -- and rare -- to see an all-female party rock climbing."
"North-early-winters-spire","Winter Spire extravaganza 7/17-18","This past weekend Ryan Bidwell and I took a couple jaunts up NEWS and SEWS at Washington Pass.  A quick look at the numbers:\
\
Placements found for the [url=http&#58;//www&#46;wildcountry&#46;co&#46;uk/frameshardware&#46;html:qvovwdrp]#6 Friend[/url:qvovwdrp]:  4\
Sesame crepes eaten (\""A nutty, sweet, chewy snack!\""): &lt; 2\
Sandwiches eaten:  8\
Amount of money scrounged for the $8 campsite fee:  $7.97\
\
Saturday morning Ryan and I drove up to the pass, taking advantage of the 20-minute rock blasting road closure to pick a route.  We agreed that the NW Corner of NEWS looked like a good option considering the questionable weather, and Ryan was anxious to put his Jolly Green Giant (#6 Friend) to use.  Our rack for the climb was robust, including lots of large Costalots.  The approach to the base of the spires via the Blue Lake trail was quick (one hour) and easy.  Upon arrival we found the area swarmed with climbers, with most of the clamor coming from the vicinity of Liberty Bell.  We started up our route behind a couple that were finishing the first pitch.\
\
I took the Christmas tree of aluminum, stopping to hike my harness back up over my hips every twenty feet.  The first two pitches were slowed by some route-finding confusion and catching up with the party in front of us.  It was almost like Chamonix- excellent rock, easy approach, routes crowded with many nationalities- the only thing missing was the splattering of bolts and Rebuffat pitons.  Ryan led the \""scary undercling\"" pitch, and we chatted with the other team at the belay.  They decided to bail, and waited until we were both off the anchor to descend.  The offwidth pitch was awkward and unpleasant.  Ryan was very happy to have the #6 along on that stretch, but we figured a #5 Costalot would have sufficed.  I am sure if I climbed this type of route enough I would learn the technique for it, but needless to say the face holds near the top were welcome.  Two easy pitches brought us to the summit where we enjoyed snack and watched the sky swirl before descending the gully.  Tons of booty gear was strewn along adventure routes on both spires, but we didn't stop to attempt any recoveries.\
\
We spent a sweltering night at the Lone Pine campground, and awoke Sunday to more dubious clouds.  The day's conversation began like this:\
\
Ryan:  So Nick, what do you feel like climbing today?\
Nick:  Well...\
Ryan:  There's \""Breakfast in Mazama.\""  I believe that's grade 1.\
\
We found ourselves at the base of SEWS with the intention of doing the west face.  I led the first pitch, handed the rack to Ryan, and we found the leaning offwidth flake pitch to be far more enjoyable than the previous day's scrabble.  We kept an eye on the skies, and the grey continued to advance.  Ryan had just begun the traverse pitch when the first drops began to fall.  We relaxed in the alcove eating snack, waiting to see if the weather would blow past to the south.  No such luck.  The rumbles approached rapidly, and soon we found ourselves playing Dodge the Lightning.  One strike hit less than half a mile away, so that sealed the deal.  An efficient descent in the rain brought us back down to the meadows and we hiked out in the refreshing showers.\

,"Royal Basin 6/18-6/19","Hi!

Steph and I planned a 4 day backpacking traverse, to go through Royal Basin, backcountry traverse and bag some summits, go over some passes, and hit up Mount Constance......

alas, we made one night in the basin, due to unexpected and unrelenting rain and overcast skies/thick fog, which would have prevented us from navigating very well....the forecast hadn't predicted rain until SATURDAY, but 'surprise'! it was already raining in Sequim Thursday when we got to the peninsula....I guess Royal Basin is in a bit of a rain shadow, so at the trailhead, we started our hike in sun and partly cloudy skies for 3 hours, then hit rain, and then the sun/fog/rain cycled continuously, leaving us uneasy about what the next 3 days would hold....

The area is beautiful, from what we could tell when the fog would clear.  I can't wait to go back when it is clear skies.  The trail is an easily graded 7 miles in to Royal Lake (there is a ranger camp there too), and then another 3/4 mile up to the Upper Basin, where we camped in a flat spot between glacial moraines, next to a beautiful boulder. Slept through rain, woke up to a trio outside our tent at 8 a.m., who were eager to summit Mount Deception....was it out there somewhere in the fog?  We watched them head up the ridge as we drank our camp coffee and debated our trip plan. The fog cleared finally so that we could see the trio heading up not Mount Deception, but the lower peak just right of it.  Steph and I decided to make a go for Deception, then hike out in the afternoon.  We headed up a snowy gully, which got progressivly steeper, and just as a 5th class rock step was ahead of us, it began to rain heavily, and we decided it best to turn back.   Back at our basin camp, we sat in the tent making cocoa and consuming 4 days worth of food....hehe, while it rained steadily, and then made back for the car once the rain paused, and hiked out for 3 hours in rain.  Beautiful trip, despite the rain.  Lots of laughter, beauty, and good times.

P.s. Leotards are IN for backpacking...synthetic, free of seamlines so there is no hip chafing with your waist belt, easy access to the bathroom, and comeon, it just feels good.  We ran into the ranger at the lake:
Ranger J: &quot;You know, there is snow up there....&quot;
Lissa: &quot;Don't worry, we brought more clothes!&quot;
Ranger J &quot;Oh, so you have a fleece leotard?&quot;
At least he had a sense of humor <!-- s:o --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_surprised.gif\"" alt=\"":o\"" title=\""Surprised\"" /><!-- s:o -->)

"ingalls-peaks","TR: Ingalls North Peak via East Ridge","Yesterday I climbed Ingalls via the E ridge with a Mountaineers party of four.  We left Seattle at 5.30am, arrived at the trail head, and were on our way hiking up to Ingalls pass by 8am.  The weather was sunny but not too hot -- I would say it was perfect.  Since this was a Wednesday, we only saw two other people the whole day.  The area is mostly melted out, we only had to pass 3 mini-snowfields on the way to the gully.  There was snow in the gully but it had retreated from the walls far enough so that we could head up the gully on the left site on rock all the way to the ramp where the climb starts.  We started climbing around noon.  Four pitches of great climbing along the ridge with good exposure at places and grand views.  There are numerous descriptions of the route on this board, on the web, and in Nelson's guide so I'll spare the details.  We reached the summit by 2.30pm, had a late lunch and rapelled down the South Face.  Hiked out and arrived at the cars at 7.45pm."
"Mount-shuksan","TR: Mount Shuksan - Fisher Chimneys 7/23-24/2004","Drove up to the Heather Meadows area Friday afternoon and began the hike in on the Lake Ann trail at 5:40 pm. An accident on I-5 in Arlington delayed us by over an hour, but it was not altogether bad because it allowed the temperatures to cool down making for a pleasant walk.  \
\
We were able to hike the 4 miles to Lake Ann quickly and we decided to continue on another mile to the first part of the Fisher Chimneys, ascend the first part, and sleep at a balcony bivy site at 5600 perched over the lower curtis glacier overlooking the entire route (highly recommended). We arrived there just after 8 pm. There was still a patch of snow to provide water, but the site will be dry soon. \
\
A nice sunset was followed by balmy temps overnight. We departed the next morning at 5 am and quickly ascended the Fisher Chimneys. The routefinding is straighforward with a few class 3-4 steps. Winnie's Slide was about 40 degrees (or a couple degrees more) as Beckey mentions if you traverse over to climbers left. Forntunately, the snow did not freeze overnight. The first few steps on the upper curtis glacier are rock hard glacier ice, but with crampons it is not a problem. Hells Highway was a breeze and we quickly rounded the corner to the Sulphide to be greeted by the early morning sun. \
\
The well traveled sulhpide route is straighforward with one small crevasse open on the track above Hells Highway. We reached the summit pyramid at about 8:15 am and free climbed the south east ridge, which is catagorized as class 5.2-5.3. There are plenty of handholds and the solid rock is much preferred over the choss pile of the center gully and the rock fall hazard caused by other climbers. After a few hundred feet of enjoyable climbing on the ridge, we reached the summit and enjoyed the views till 9:15. \
\
On the descent, we decided to stay away from the multidudes of climbers going up and down the gully causing rock fall on each other and descended the relatively solid southeast ridge. Back on the glacier, we cruised all the way back to winnies slide only stopping to take photos. Winnie's slide took some time to downclimb but after that it was right down to the chimneys to the bivy site where we ate lunch and packed up. The walk out was hot, but a breeze prevented it from becoming unbearable arriving at the car at 2:45 pm. \
\
It was nice to be the only people on the Fisher Chimney's route that day. I was expecting the route to be longer or take more time, but it was nice to finish up early. The Fisher Chimney route is cool as you get a little bit of everything on it and the terrain on the way is rugged and dramatic. Overall, it was a very enjoyable day on a great route that is in good shape right now."
,"WA pass...back for more","Journeyed back to WA pass this weekend to avoid the heat. Surprisingly successful, although it was a bit hot Sat afternoon. Nice breeze though. Probably not more than 80 or 85. Really surprising. No bugs!\
\
Saturday, Chris and I left trailhead around 10:30 or so. Climbed the W. face of NEWS. Very cool route. As nice as granite gets around here. Managed to not fall off the crux, which is really short and a giveaway at the grade. But no complaining here. The 5.10 pitch after that is also pretty easy for the grade, but it is a really beautiful finger crack. Although short (4 pitches) this was a really nice climb, definitely recommend it. And it would be really easy to yard through the thin crack if you so desired. Bring extra small-mid size nuts. Combined/altered some pitches/belays, which worked very well. Happy to share if you care. \
\
Had extra time after a short nap at summit and base, so went over a climbed the becky route on the bell. Never done that before. Approach was awful at 4:30 in the pm on the hottest day of the year while hoards of fools trundled shit on us. Became very dehydrated. Climbed route. got more dehydrated. Got rope stuck on decent. Got to climb the rappel line. Hiked out...to the car by 9:45. we were moving very slow. \
\
Tried re-hydrating with warm Coors Original. Was sad to see that Coors is no longer calling the yellow can \""banquet beer\"". Now its just original...what’s up with that. \
\
Crack of 9:30 wake-up Sunday morning. Having proved Coors to be inferior, we attempt coffee as a re-hydrating agent. Mixed success, but the box of chocolate chip cookies provides sufficient calories to get us out of camp. Left trailhead at 10:45...you know your doing well when you are behind schedule from the day before...when you left from seattle! Oops. \
\
Decided mid-hike we were tired. Climbed the SW rib on SEWS to firish the route after Nick and I made it part-way up last weekend before the thunderstorm. Traveled very slowly. Great day, with a really nice breeze and some really neat views of a couple of fires down towards lake Chelan. Fun to watch them build up each day and then subside at night. \
\
Booty was had on becky route and SW rib. One wire gate biner, on BD nut tool and a #2 WC tech friend. Together, booty value &gt; gas/beer expenses .... so the trip can be concluded as successful."
"Mount-maude","TR:  Maude, dog route, 7/24","Sweltering heat, insanely clear weather, a dearth of recent quality time spent in the mountains.  What's a weekend warrior to do?  A few friends were hell set on skiing the Emmons, but I was soured on skiing for the remainder of the season after a recent experience on Mt. Adams, and had made a firm decision to stow the boards for the hot summer.  Once upon a time I regularly made solo trips to the mountains - I enjoy the solitude, the loneliness, the quiet introspection.  I've gotten away from it in the last few years, partly because I've met more partners, but also as the trips have become more adventurous, so has the difficulty. I had been craving solitude recently and needed some time to think.\
\
To maximize my heat wave enjoyment, I decided to head over to the east side of crest, \""Highs of 96-101\"" be damned.  Friday afternoon, on a hunch I checked the forecast soundings and my suspicion was confirmed.  The calm winds, clear sky and strong heating meant the lower atmosphere would be quite close to dry adiabatic by afternoon, meaning the temperature as one went up would be the same as lifting a parcel of dry air from the ground upward.  In fact, the forecast sounding was a perfect dry adiabat.  The temperature would decrease a full 6.5 C / km, or about 5 F / 1000 ft.  95 in the valleys at 2000 ft equates to not so bad at 8000 ft.  I settled on Chiwawa.  Beckey calls the easy route class 2, and I reasoned I should be able to find a bivy spot on, or close to the summit.  With luck there will also be a remnant patch of snow for drinking water.\
\
Cruising over the pass, I tuned the radio to 1610 AM for the \""Forest info\"" hoping to hear something about the Leavenworth fire.  \""We currently have fires burning in the Icicle Creek Valley, on Pot Peak near Lake Chelan and in the Chiwawa River Valley near Trinity.\""  What the $^*^@?  I just checked their web page Friday afternoon and there was no mention of a fire near Trinity.  I made a quick detour to the ranger station.  Sure enough, the trails in the Chiwawa are closed, but the ones on either side, in Buck Creek and Phelps Creek are open.  The closure had just gone into effect.  \""How big is the fire?\""  \""Only about 20 acres.\""  \""So there isn't a lot of smoke?\""  \""No, not from this one.\""  I changed plans to head up to Maude.  The south side is also class 2, and at 9000+ ft it should have a nice view.\
\
The climb was uneventful, if a bit hot.  I made it to the summit in a little over six hours at a moderately relaxed pace.  Ever conscious of heat exhaustion, I used a hose connected to my platypus as a hydration system for the first time. I was hooked after the first 15 minutes.  All told, I managed to suck down 11 quarts of water on Saturday.  There is a perfect one person bivy spot a few feet below the summit, conveniently situated next to a snow patch.  I cooked dinner, watched the light play off the peaks and shot some photos.  It was a little hazy from the fires, but not overly so.\
\
The night was initially calm, but the wind soon picked up, reluctantly rousing me from my bivy sack to make an half-assed rock wall.  I'm glad it did though, because the northern lights had silently started.  Vertical sheets of green danced back and forth, and every few seconds one would shoot off into space at an alarming speed, to be immediately replaced by another sheet.  This is now the third time I've seen them, and every time they seem like a dream the following morning.  They don't seem quite real, not in the same sense as looking at a mountain or a cloud.  They are somehow far away, intangible.  Perhaps it is because they are emitted light, not reflected light, the same way a slide on a light box takes on a different character, a certain je ne sais quoi, from the same slide printed onto a piece of paper.\
\
All the haze had settled into the valleys by sunrise, and the morning light was pure and razor sharp.  I photographed for a long while and lounged on the summit until I had had my fill of views.  I only stopped once on the descent to fill my water bottle and tummy, arriving at the car well before the heat really set in again.  Even still, it was unbearably hot by the time I turned onto the highway.  The pass finally brought relief; the thermal trough had exited east, dragging in its wake a substantial marine push and cooler air."

"Mount-baker","TR: Mount Baker - Easton Glacier 7/27","Jessie and I climbed Mount Baker via the Easton Glacier route in under a half day. The appraoch was straightforward. The glacier was quite crevassed and required endrunning at multiple points. The summit view was filtered heavily by the smoke plume drifting in from the fire near Bella Coola, BC. Some of the older tracks that trend to climbers right are now impassable with open or very weak snowbridges. The best route now stays over more left until just before the crater. \
\
We did the climb in 9 hours 15 min car to car; 7,500 feet of elevation gain and loss. We started just after 4:45 am and finished up just after 2pm. We spent over a half hour at the summit and a half hour breaking/roping up and we also stopped to look at the crater. We came down the mountain leisurely taking photos of the seracs and giant crevasses so a speed attempt of under 8 hours is very feasible. There was one large party of seven on the Easton other than us, but plenty of climbers on the CD route. \
\
I imagine that if the hot weather of recent continues, the route up the Easton will become much more circuitious and involve interesting crevasse crossings. Overall, the Easton is a nice, straightforward route that in late season provides the climber with a nice look into a very active glacier."

,"Exit 38: Mt. Washington","On Sunday Roanne and I decided to do some climbing at exit 38.  I had only climbed at Nevermind Wall and the Trestle areas, so we decided it would be fun to check out some of the areas on Mt. Washington.  Roanne's foot was bothering her from playing volleyball the day before, so we decided to avoid the longer hike up to the Bob's World areas and check out Club Paradiso, The Actual Cave, and Amazonia.\
\
The hike in was pleasant, and we started out at Club Paradiso.  I was surpised at how blocky and ledgy it looked, but we decided to try it out anyways, starting on [i:q94lxpi0]Lush[/i:q94lxpi0], a scrambly but entertaining 5.8 on heavily textured rock.  We then did the route to the left of that, [i:q94lxpi0]Trappline[/i:q94lxpi0], a 5.10a with a crux characterized by an awkward mantle (not super fun).\
\
Next we moved into the Actual Cave, which was pretty cool to see.  I knew it was a full on cave, but was still somewhat taken aback by the completely horizontal climbing featured on most of the routes.  I did the classic 5.11c [i:q94lxpi0]Giant[/i:q94lxpi0], as well as it's 5.12a extension [i:q94lxpi0]Mr. Big[/i:q94lxpi0], both of which were really fun.  Lots of good heel hooking and a bit of campus action on huge jugs.  It is a bit of a weird atmosphere climbing in a cave, but I would recommend going there to at least check these routes out, they are pretty cool.\
\
Next we headed down to Amazonia, where we did the classic [i:q94lxpi0]Igaunorama[/i:q94lxpi0], a super fun slightly overhanging 5.10a on huge hand swallowing jugs.  Next we did [i:q94lxpi0]Tropicana[/i:q94lxpi0], a 5.10c which the book raves about but I didn't think was that good.  It has three sections of climbing broken up by ledges you can stand on, which I don't think is the making of a great climb.  To finish up we did [i:q94lxpi0]Primus[/i:q94lxpi0], a 5.11a (or 5.11b depending on which guidebook you use) in between the two aforementioned climbs.  It was really good, with a fun but easy roof to start with, then some harder, sustained climbing on edges above.\
\
A good day of climbing, and I am looking forward to going back for two objectives:\
1. Check out the Bob's World areas higher up which look to have some really good routes.\
2. Do \""Amazonia-in-a-day\"": go to Amazonia and start at one end and work to the other, climbing all of the routes in one outing.  It would be fun since they are all in the 5.9 to 5.11- range, and would make for a good endurance work out."
,"TR: Terror Basin 7/31-8/1","Short version:\
My sister wanted to \""hike\"" somewhere remote.  I took her to the pickets.\
\
Long version:\
My sister lives in Lyon, France, a short drive from the Alps.  She is in Seattle this month on vacation and was complaining that while the alps are beautiful mountains, the hikes are overcrowded and there is too much infrastructure (huts, etc) - they don't feel \""wild\"".  So, she asked me to take her on a \""wild\"" and \""isolated\"" hike.  Immediately I thought this would be a good opportunity to scout one of the routes into the Picket range.  Given that it was my first trip to that area, we elected to try the relatively accessible Goodell Creek approach to Terror Basin.  We left Seattle a little after 5AM Saturday and were at the old logging road turnoff from the Goodell Group Camp road before 8:00.  In addition to my Camry there were three burly trucks at the trailhead (see [url:18ozfgzo]http&#58;//www&#46;cascadeclimbers&#46;com/threadz/showflat&#46;php/Cat/0/Number/378186/page/0/view/collapsed/sb/5/o/all/fpart/1[/url:18ozfgzo] for an example of what one can do in the southern Pickets besides chill and enjoy the views like us.\

1)The first couple hours on the old logging road is a full on trail; I was expecting it to be more overgrown with brush than it was.  The turnoff for terror basin is easy to find if you look for the obvious signs of prior campgrounds in the trail at its base.  \
\
2)Gain about 4000 vertical feet up steep climber trail.  It is all dry and I easily went through 2 nalgenes in this section. \
\
3)Break out into heather benches and traverse to the (obvious) rocky/snowy notch.  This section was phenominally beautiful, with views across the Goodell Creek valley to Triumph and Despair.  Near the notch, Mt. Baker comes into view also.  We had some difficulty staying on the \""trail\"" which seemed to fade out frequently up here, but travel was easy trail or no (in general the strategy is to traverse high).  \
\
4)From the notch, there is a short descent to the flat camping area on an old moraine.  This descent is always mentioned in passing, but I just want to say that when it is melted out (as last weekend), the \""rock\""/\""talus\""/\""scree\"" underneath is extremely nasty (ball bearings on top of fist-size to backpack-size rocks on top of ball bearings).  We had no helmets but we really should have; we took turns descending, moving well to the side, then the other person would descend, unavoidably dropping very large rocks at high speed down the slope onto the snowfield below.  Fortunately the light traffic on this route reduces the chance of another party killing you with rockfall.  \
\
5)The terror basin camp rocks.  We did have to share it with another party of three (AAI course that was up there for 12 days (!)).  Incredible showy displays of flowers, running water, surrounded by Pickets, what more can you ask for?  \
\
6)We went light (no tent, no stove) and made up for it by bringing fresh pesto pasta salad for dinner from the deli at QFC.  That is definitely the way to go.\
\
7)In the morning I considered making a run at west Mac spire (my sister wasn;t up for it) but stayed in character and slept until 9:00 instead.  We had breakfast, I went up to the Stetattle/Terror divide to check out the views of Azure lake (stunning waterfalls, highly recommended, 40 minutes round trip from camp) and then headed out the way we came.  \
\
<!-- s8) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cool.gif\"" alt=\""8)\"" title=\""Cool\"" /><!-- s8) -->The descent would be fast if you had good poles, good ankles and good knees.  We had 4 good knees but only 2 good ankles and no good poles, and it took us almost as long to get back to the car is it took to get to camp (~10h each way).  Besides the ankles we felt pretty good, our minimalist packing strategy made the whole of the hike surprisingly comfortable.\
\
\
What we learned:\
\
1)Never, Never, NEVER leave the trecking poles in the car\
2)Ditto for the helmets\
3)Light is good.  I think I would rather do this hike three times with a 3 day pack than 1 time with a 9 day pack."
"liberty-bell-mountain","Liberty Crack on Liberty Bell","On Sunday (Aug 31), Gary and I went up Liberty Crack.  We woke up at 4am, hit the trail by 5am, and were climbing by 6am.  Darkness hit after we'd completed pitch 10 and before pitch 11.  We summited around midnight (probably a bit earlier) and were back at the car by 3am.  23 hours car-to-car.  It was a long day.\

Some of the fixed gear on the route does indeed look questionable.\
\
This trip was almost exactly my 1 year anniversary of trad climbing.  It also turned out to be my first climb to fall on gear, ironically [i:3w3pg2b0]after[/i:3w3pg2b0] I'd completed all the sketchy C2 aid on the 3rd pitch.  It was a roughly 40ft fall.  The rest of the trip, I was really freaked out about leading.  I have to compliment Gary on the amount of leading he did for the rest of the climb.  He dragged my sorry ass up that big rock (I only lead a couple easy pitches after that).\
\
It's a nice climb, though, and I do think it's better done in a day than in two.  I'd like to go back and do it again.  Quick summary:  pitches 1-3 are aid.  Pitches 4-11 are free.  Pitch 12 is a 4th class traverse to the rap anchors.  Two single rope raps (double rope rap likely to result in stuck rope), downclimbing a loose but easy gully, and some hiking on good trail and along the freeway takes you back to the car.\
\
Gear:  (Correct me if I'm wrong, Gary)  Double set of cams, single set of nuts from quite big down to itty-bitty, cam hook, sky hook, 60m 10.5mm rope to climb on, 50m 7mm cord for emergency rap (unused), 14 draws with biners, 30 loose biners in addition, aiders, daisies, and the standard anchor necessities (lockers, cordolettes).  It turned out to be the perfect size rack."
"prusik-peak","schooled by the SF of Prusik","Pax (Alpinfox) and I set out to do the SF of Prusik this weekend as a \""daytrip\""  <!-- s:wink: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\"" alt=\"":wink:\"" title=\""Wink\"" /><!-- s:wink: --> \
\
The weather straightened itself compared to Friday night, and the Saturday night sleepingbag-less bivy was quite nice.  Woke up early in the morning and scrambled up to 7500 ft on Mt. Temple for sunrise.  Pax was still asleep, though he woke up briefly when he heard my trundle.  I love the fresh smell of rockfall in the morning.\
\
We started up the South Face around 9 AM.  With a 60m rope, we had maybe 10 feet leftover linking the first pitch and the second pitch.  The first pitch reminded me that I haven't done much wide stuff lately.  Pax led up the second pitch.  Our route description was pretty vague -- Nelson describes going up and slightly right along corner systems.  Pax went pretty far right at first, and we thought that he had gone too far right (i.e. toward Beckey-Davis), so after a 15-ft awkward chimney (with a handcrack on the left), he exited left.  \
\
We didn't see a chimney with a chockstone around but we saw a nice line, so we went up.  A nice corner went up and left for about 30 feet; a handcrack was in it, though it became just a shallow groove at times.  When it ended, I had to traverse across slabs for about ten feet to an even nicer-looking corner.  I made it about twenty feet up the corner before the climbing got too hard for the ropedrag.  I set up a belay and brought Pax up.  Pax finished the corner, which became more of face climbing (and less pro) toward the end.  An impressive lead on his part.  There was a stuck rope from a previous party in the corner; I couldn't unstick it so I cut it and hauled up both ends.  \
\
When I got to the belay where Pax was, I understood why there was a stuck rope.  The summit was maybe a pitch and a half away, but the climbing looked hard, like 5.11 hard (after reading the Beckey guide, it's apparently only 5.10+, including a 10d offwidth  <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\"" alt=\"":shock:\"" title=\""Shocked\"" /><!-- s:shock: -->).  Then the rapping began.  We had just a single 60m rope and various pieces of an old chopped rope.  But we managed to find horns, bail biners, bail nuts, etc.  We even struck gold on brand-new belay bolts after the first rap.  Oddly, they seemed to be 35m apart, as if the person developing up there was using a 70m rope.  For the next few rappels, we were playing all sorts of hijinks (downward aiding, etc.) to reach the next set of anchors.  The final pitch off the ground we had a quarter-inch bolt with a loose hanger and a crack that would take thin wires.  Not wanting to leave gear behind, we down-led that pitch (actually a nice 5.7 pitch once it was gardened).  \
\
We were disappointed not to summit, but we still had a great adventure.  The corner pitches that we found were nice, and were either 5.10- or scary 5.9 on insecure holds above gear.  After lunch at camp (pitas with havarti and smoked salmon), we hiked out, not before I got my requisite dip in Lake Vivian.  Amazing how refreshing it feels, though I always seem to have the habit of scraping my knee or shin when exiting the water because I'm in such a hurry to dry off, get dressed, and warm up.  Toward the end of the hike down, I pulled out the summit shot (single-malt scotch) and renamed it the got-down-safely shot.  Tasty.\
\
There's an old fixed 3.5 Camalot about 20 feet off the ground at the start of the Burger-Stanley.\

And we'll be back!\

"Mount-rainier","Rainier 8/14-15:  escapade on Emmons","[b:1fgjh4dj]Short version[/b:1fgjh4dj]\
\
Went up Rainier this past weekend with five friends.  The climb was excellent, the route was in great shape, and nobody died.\
\
[b:1fgjh4dj]Long version[/b:1fgjh4dj]\
\
A quick look at the numbers:\
\
miles hiked:  too many\
total denelivation:  20,000 feet\
# of hours I slept between 6am Saturday and midnight Sunday (42 hours):  2\
expressed as a percentage of that time:  4.76%\
collective snow bridge punch-throughs:  3\
my pack weight without water:  35 lbs\
Ben's \""     \""          \""          \""    :  33 lbs\
average pack weight of group from N Carolina we passed on the Inter Glacier:  65 lbs\
\
Friday afternoon our group converged upon the White River campground.  The cast included the better part of the RFA Climbing Posse:  Ben Lockard, Chris Emerson, and myself (Ryan Bidwell was sadly missed), new inductee Doug, longtime climbing partner Andy Lewis, and his girlfriend Katherine Beavis, who will [b:1fgjh4dj]never, ever[/b:1fgjh4dj] come on another climbing trip with us.  This was more on account of the conversation content than any other factor.\
\
Sunday morning we left the trailhead just after seven.  The stroll up to the foot of the Inter Glacier was quick and pleasant.  We roped up as two teams of three and trudged up through soft snow, troughs of slush, and rock-strewn patches of ice.  Our transition onto the Emmons was slightly awkward as we left the Inter too high and ended up scrambling around on the chossy slopes until we descended back to the poorly defined trail through the rubble.  Schurman was in sight, and the highlights of the remainder of the approach included navigating the fragile snow bridges and hopping over exposed crevasses.  Being tall has its advantages in many areas of climbing, not the least of which is being able to more easily leap across crevasses.  Katherine, who is much shorter than I, took a little encouragement, but eventually jumped over the largest one gracefully.\
\
We probed a site and excavated tent platforms at the flats on the glacier above Camp Schurman at 9,800 feet.  Andy and Katherine shared my single wall tent, Ben crawled into his, and Chris and Doug pitched their tent just uphill of us.  As we were clustered around making camp, Ben observed that we were suffering symptoms of acute HAFE:  high altitude flatulence epidemic.  The typical irreverence of our blend of immature and nerdy humor kept the laughs coming.  A line of squalls moved in and I made dinner for Andy, Katherine and I while standing around in the wind and rain.  After eating the calorie bomb meal of pasta vegetable soup fortified with cheese, couscous, and tuna fish, I joined Ben in the tent.  We laughed away while the wind whipped at the tent, and I managed to doze off for a little while before my alarm went off at 10:16.\
\
I unzipped the door and looked up at stars.  The night was still, cool, and clear.  Andy and I chatted between tents, figuring we were in the weather window before the second wave of unstable marine air was supposed to move in, so we decided it was rally time.  At 11:20 we began the summit push.  I led on the first rope with Katherine and Andy, Doug led the second with Chris and Ben.  Our plan was to leave very early with the expectation of moving slowly.  That is exactly what happened.\
\
We climbed the first thousand feet in one hour, but slowed down after that.  Katherine was starting to feel the altitude.  The route was easy to follow, snow conditions were firm, and the crevasse crossings were all straightforward.  The psychological cushion of darkness is a welcome deception on Rainier.  The immensity of the mountain and towering mass of seracs are invisible beyond the feeble glow of a headlamp.  Below us we counted five teams on the route.\
\
At about 4:00 Andy spotted the second wave of weather approaching.  It had been so long in coming that I was beginning to wonder if it would show up at all.  We had current and detailed weather forecasts, confirmed by the ranger at Schurman, so we knew the instability was predicted to blow through.  We stopped to put on our jackets and kept going.  The wind picked up, the summit was obscured, and some turbulent clouds swirled around Liberty Cap.  Climbing on through the deteriorating conditions was slightly less fun, but we arrived at the steeper section and persevered up to the base of the bergschrund.  It was big.\
\
The route traversed a long way to the north, which was fine since it was mostly level, but we were moving straight into the wind.  We were now at 13,000 feet and at freezing level, so wind chill was easily below zero.  Katherine was suffering from the cumulative effects of altitude, dehydration, cold, and fatigue.  The wind and spindrift were chilling, and I was only able to maintain a tolerable level of numbness while moving.  With the warm temps, high freezing level, and decent forecast I had gone a bit lighter on gear than usual.  My plastic boots and baffled down jacket would have kept me happier than my leather boots did.  After a quick chat we decided that Andy would stay with Katherine while the rest of us continued.  I left them my sleeping bag, they took a stove, and I tied into the other rope.\
\
Doug led the rest of the way over the bergschrund and up the summit slope.  Visibility was down to 150 feet as we ascended up into the lenticular cloud.  A team of four passed us on their descent.  They had turned back below the summit not knowing where to go.  Five minutes later we reached the crater rim, and shortly after that we found the antenna and the summit.  The others were uncertain we were actually there, but I recognized the terrain and convinced them that just because we couldn’t see anything didn’t mean we weren’t on the summit.  Despite the brisk conditions I felt great.  This was the strongest I had felt on any Rainier climb, I noticed no ill effects of altitude at all.  The added bonus of the weather made things even more enjoyable.\
\
We headed back to rejoin Andy and Katherine.  We passed a team of climbing rangers who were ascending faster than we were descending.  Katherine was feeling much better, we were below the cloud, and the rising sun was warming us up a bit.  After a break we descended back to the flats.  En route Doug punched a leg through a snow bridge and pulled himself out.  We rested, packed up, and filtered water down at Schurman.  The state of the toilet there was an abomination, and became the lively topic of conversation for the rest of the day.  While exiting the Emmons Glacier, Doug  caused more excitement when he broke off a refrigerator-sized block of ice while hopping over a crevasse, but he did a nice flop onto the other side.  Conveniently Chris was belaying him off a picket.  Katherine then stuck her leg through an ice bridge, and we crossed over onto the Inter Glacier none too soon.\
\
On the way up was a group of climbers from North Carolina, struggling desperately underneath mammoth packs.  We waited five minutes for one of their members to wobble precariously across a crevasse that even short-legged Katherine stepped over without blinking.  Good luck to them.  Chris gave them an earnest warning about the Emmons.  I wonder if they made it to Schurman without collapsing any of the remaining snow bridges.  When we got off the glacier everyone was jealous of Andy, who had hiked up to the snow in a pair of running shoes and donned them for the descent.\
\
Back in the parking lot I found Andy’s keys, chilled the beer, and sat around eating chips and drinking water for 45 minutes until everyone else showed up.  Doug hobbled in, dropped his pack, and lay down on the pavement.  Collapsed in various positions around the back of my truck we must have been quite a sight, because an elderly woman who passed by asked to take a photo of us.\

Gear Notes\
\
Stuff we had and used\
-	Pickets\
-	Shovel\
-	Avy probe (better to not pitch your tent on a crevasse)\
-	water filter (saves lots fuel and time)\
-	blue bags!  It is better to freeze your ass in the wind than to experience the putrescence of the loo at Schurman\
\
Stuff we had and didn’t use\
-	some extra food\
-	GPS\

,"Mounties teaching us to climb alpine ice","I was pleasantly surprised to find AaronZ on the Ice1 Fieldtrip for the Mounties intermediate course (I was supposed to take it last year but it got cancelled at the last minute).  \
\
We went onto the Nisqually to play around on the seracs.  Mostly it was low-angle stuff, but we did TR some steep stuff.  Toward the end of the fieldtrip, AaronZ and I and swung some leads on steep stuff when it was clear to the instructors that we knew what we were doing.  There's not much sustained steeps unless you could find a particularly big crevasse to rap into.  Mostly low-angle terrain with occasional 20-foot steep steps.  \
\
I didn't feel like wearing gloves at all during the trip, so my knuckles are looking pretty cool right now.\
\
I got to try the WillG trick of using a sling instead of a Abalakov hook for V-threading.\
It worked great when I drilled the two holes nearly perfectly aligned but not so great when the holes were only slightly intersecting (a hook would work fine there).  \
\
I hauled a 9oz aluminum axe up there to see how it would perform on the ice... not well at all.  It works ok in neve, but it's nearly worthless in ice.\
\
Felt good to swing those tools again!\

10 or so arrive at the base of Chanti east face.  Send josh up a nice 5.8/5.9 variation to the first pitch which is really sustained and happens to take us over an hour an half to climb.

On Saturday Ralph and I went to climb at Index, but it was wet, so we kept going to Leavenworth. We didn't have the guidebook, so had to resort to Castle Rock, and had a great time despite my having been there about 8 times before. For me the day was a huge success because, totally unpredicted, I managed to send my old nemesis, MF Overhang (5.10c, and I used to think it was more like 5.11a, but now I think it's actually more like 5.10c, based on most Leavenworth trad ratings). In fact, it didn't even feel that bad! Killer, totally frickin' killer. \
\
Ralph easily dispatched the Bone, we both flailed and failed on the Nose (5.10d, felt very, very stiff), we wandered up Midway to get off Jello tower, and then I scared myself silly on Damnation crack, which is only rated like 5.8 or something (what is it actually rated?), but hot damn, baby, chimneys are scary as all hell!

The bugs are about gone, the firelines are holding, the few remaining spots are just about out. I am now ready to head back into the hills - to Canada!\

,"Now I'm stronger...","And I sent my summer project!  Last night I climbed at Exit 32, and finally sent Californicator, a 5.12d that I have been working on.  I first tried it around the middle of May, and since then have had 27 attempts on it, finally sending last night on the 27th try.  Initially I could do it with four hangs, then got it down to three, then two, then a week ago I got it down to one, and finally I was able to send.  This is far and away the longest I have spent projecting a climb, but I didn't get sick of it because the climbing is so awesome that you have fun each time you are on it, no matter how many falls you take.\

After bailing on a trip to Slesse and some nasty weather, our 3 day weekend of climbing was turning out to be a sunday afternoon at Index. I couldn't accept it, so saturday night I called up Pax and with no arm twisting roped him in for a day climb of the west ridge of stuart the next day. An hour or so later he was at my place and we drove off to spend the night at the trailhead. In short, we left the car around 5am, on top by 12:30, and back to the cars by 6. We brought a 60 meter half rope and doubled it over. We had a small-medium rack of 1/2 a set of nuts, 4 of tcus up to .75, a #1 camalot, and a fist sized hex. Used it all except the hex, though we only roped for something like 4 pitches. a good day out, great route (lots of clean 3rd and 4th class granite scrambling), and I was feeling in good shape. just in time for fall I guess  <!-- s:roll: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_rolleyes.gif\"" alt=\"":roll:\"" title=\""Rolling Eyes\"" /><!-- s:roll: --> \

5:15 leave car\
8:15 start route\
3:15 top out\
\
There was some enjoyable scrambling that at the start of the route that made me sad to break out the rope.  I believe we did the 5.9 finger crack/ lieback variation before the pillar that would be much easier with a little cleaning but Jesse had my nut tool.  The 5.8 pitch and the 5.7 diehradral were alot of fun.  There was some fun simuling after the pillar that kinda reminded me of some of the pitches on the north ridge of stuart.  Then I lead us off route to a short section of dirty wet 5.8 climbing required to get us back on route.\
\
Also twice I found reminants of other parties on route on ledges.  Which sucked.  If your not going to carry a blue bag then do what I do which is to drop it on a rock then toss into a neighboring gulley.  I mean if your climbing up one of dragontails choss gulleys you deserve a shit covered rock tossed on you.\

gear \
10 slings should have had more for longer simuling pitches\
cams to #3 friend a 3.5 friend would have been nice\
5 nuts cause all the tr's i read said there were mostly parralell cracks so I was constently running out of nuts\
4 smallest tricams should have only brought the brown one\
boots, crampons and poons for descent next time I'm bringing trekking polls instead of an axe\

"leavenworth-area-climbs","Condorphamine Addiction","I think this counts as cragging...  It's a 1 hour hike in to do a beautiful, safely bolted 7-pitch sport climb.\
\
Seth and Paul wanted to learn about multi-pitch climbing.  They've both climbed at Vertical World and a bit at exit 38, and Seth has caving experience, but neither had multi-pitch experience (except a not-entirely-successful attempt at Orbit:  <!-- m --><a class=\""postlink\"" href=\""http://uw.cascadeclimbers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1501\"">http://uw.cascadeclimbers.com/forum/vie ... php?t=1501</a><!-- m -->).  I just went along to tell them what to do, since I hear that's what women are for: offering advice.  As I'd hoped, this is a great route for a beginning 5.10 sport leader.  All you need are a dozen quickdraws.  Since the preferred descent is to rap the route (chains provided on all anchors), bailing early is also easy which is reassuring when people are learning.  The rock is good.  The route is obvious.  The difficulty increases gradually as you ascend, a warm up on easier pitches before tackling the harder (5.10a/b) pitches.  The hardest sections are bolted closely enough to aid on, that is, you can reach the next bolt with the previous one at your knee or hip.\
\
I used the topo from:\
  <!-- m --><a class=\""postlink\"" href=\""http://www.mountainwerks.org/cma/2004/images/condorphamine.jpg\"">http://www.mountainwerks.org/cma/2004/i ... hamine.jpg</a><!-- m -->\
The numbers of bolts on each pitch are correctly marked.  The topo mostly says it all.  The climbing is nice, high-friction slab.  Pitch 5 (5.10b) is mostly 5.8 with a short 5.10 crux.  There are no handholds; you just place your hands on the largest bumps you can find and sort of stem up.  Pitch 6 (5.10b) is more sustained but generally easier than the crux moves on pitch 5.\
\
We took our time leaving Seattle, getting on the trail, and getting ready to climb.  We started climbing around 1pm.  I've never climbed with 3 people before and don't know whether there is a standard way of managing ropes with that setup.  I had Paul tie in to the end of one rope; Seth tie into the end of the other rope; and me tie in to both ropes.  Paul and Seth alternated leads, and I climbed each pitch inbetween the two guys, so the ropes always ended up stacked with the leader's end on top.  It turned out that between the two of them, they were able to do all the leading.  My purpose was for conversation (and a few safety pointers), logistics, and as a safety blanket (Seth and Paul would not have felt comfortable doing that climb without a more experienced person along).  I believe all the pitches are less than 30m.  You could thus link a lot of them.  But since the guys wanted to learn about multi-pitch climbing, I figured the more pitches the better.  <!-- s:) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\"" alt=\"":)\"" title=\""Smile\"" /><!-- s:) -->  We reached the top of pitch 6 around 5pm.  Because of the time, we turned around one pitch shy of the top.  The rappel went totally smoothly.  We did a double-rope rappel (~50m) to descend pitches 6 and 5, followed by single-rope rappels (~25m) the rest of the way down.  I also showed the guys how to simul-rappel (one person on each of the two rope strands).  We were back at the car by 7pm, just as dusk was starting to fall.  By not summiting, we missed out on some nice views of the peaks above the Enchantments, and the excitement of trying to find an occassionally-loose climber's trail in the dark by one headlamp."

"Forbidden-peak","Forbidden peak near-epic","Josh, Kam and I headed out last weekend to do the west ridge of Forbidden peak. What a sweet route! But conditions and our own stupidity caused us to not summit and turn a relatively straightforward climb into an incredibly long ordeal. Still, it was fun. \
\
As the story goes, there was &gt; 1 foot of still fresh snow covering the glacier and upper rock slabs near the approach. Because Josh read somewhere that on the approach you can avoid the glacier entirely and stay on the slabs, he and I decided to leave our crampons and axes at home. Bad call - there was frozen snow everywhere in the early morning, and it was way sketchy wearing only shoes. Luckily Kam brought his axes and 'pons, and so the 3 of us shared one pair of crampons between us. This involved taking the crampons apart, so we each got 1/2 of a crampon, lashed to a foot with webbing! Josh got two 'pon halves, but one kept falling off so he just clipped it to his harness. Anyway, that got us up the glacier, to the approach gully. Normally this is snow-filled, and straightforward, but in late-season you apparently climb a different gully, which is just 3rd class rock/dirt. For some reason (probably because we saw a rap station somewhere above), we ignored this advice and climbed the steep wall right beside (climber's left) of the snow gully. This was a great pitch of exposed 5.8+ climbing, the steepest pitch I've ever led of true alpine rock and far harder than anything we encountered on the west ridge proper. But after that first pitch it was just super dirty low-5th up loose ramps, and it was clear that we were in the wrong spot. Oops. Two and a half hours later, after wallowing in waist-deep snow for a bit in our rock shoes, we were actually on the west ridge. From here, it was reasonably quick simul-climbing up the route, but knowing that we had to downclimb the whole thing, and moving fairly slowly as a party of 3, we hit our turnaround time a couple of pitches shy of the top. Well, turning around was the right decision. On the way down, downclimbing the now-slushy exposed snow-covered slabs nearly turned tragic when Josh slipped (we were roped together). I had him on a hip belay from below, but superhero Kam (above) saw the fall and leaped the other way to counter the fall, and held him. Yikes. After that, we decided that, time be damned, we would play it safe and lower ourselves with proper anchors until we reached the glacier proper. A buried axe and some rock pro did the trick, but it took forever to lower down the 3 pitches or so back to the glacier. \
\
The long and short of it is that we got back to camp at 11:15 pm, back to the car just before 3:00 am, and back to Seattle (after a nap at Marblemount and breakfast in Darrington) at 9:00 am. Work yesterday was just a bit unproductive for all of us...\
\
Well, sketchiness aside, it was still a fun trip in a beautiful place! Kam took some beautiful photos, and once he posts them to his site I'll include them here. \
And as for the west ridge of Forbidden, well the climbing was pretty easy, so sometime when the conditions are simpler I'll just have to go and car-to-car it to restore my bruised ego...\

"ingalls-peaks","S. Ridge of Ingalls","I had an unexpected free day this past Monday so I headed for the mountains with my office mate's brother, who is visiting from Austin, TX.  Sarp and I left Seattle around 6:45 and were hiking up the trail by 9:20.  The sky was crystal clear all day.  We eventually came to the pass and got our first view of Ingalls and Stuart.  We stopped briefly at the lake before heading up to the base of the climb.  We expected the two pitches to go pretty quickly, but we didn't get there early enough.  There was a party of six mountaineers on the route aready not moving at any great speed.  We sat at the base of the route for over 2 hours waiting until it was our turn to climb.  Sarp took the lead on the first pitch and made quick work of it.  On the way he freed a nut that they'd left behind.  I took the second and soon after we had dropped our rope at the rap station and headed up for a quick summit photo.  Then we began our descent.  The mountaineers felt bad about delaying us and grateful to get their nut back, so they let us do a double rope rappel with them.  Unfortunately, when they pulled the rope it got stuck about 30 ft. up.  Sarp scrambled up to free it for them.  We then rapped down to our packs and headed out.  We reached the car around 7:20 and stopped at BK in Cle Elum before heading back to Seattle.  All in all a beautiful day and a fun climb"

"leavenworth-area-climbs","Pearly Gates, Oct. 2","For those lost souls who are wondering how they will pass through the Pearly Gates: fear not!  Take comfort in the knowledge that there is a no-hands rest after the crux.\
\
Dan P and I got in a half-day of climbing at Pearly Gates in Leavenworth this past weekend.  It's a really nice place to climb, with shade most of the day, clean white rock, and a good selection of routes, from slabs and face climbing to steep clean cracks, 5.7 to 5.12a (most below 5.11).  The approach is a bit of a pain compared to the other roadside crags in the Icicle Canyon, but worth it.\
\
We warmed up on Celestial Groove.  That woke me up fast.  It's nice and steep after the groove, with more face climbing than I expected.  Next Dan led Easy Pickins, which is a little contrived and awkwardly bolted, and I continued up the second pitch of Cloud Nine (fun face climbing, though short).\
\
We had been eyeing Pearly Gates, which goes up a thin crack left of Celestial Groove and through a roof, continuing up twin cracks.  Dan led it first and sent in good style, shouting for joy, which inspired me to do the same.  This is the best route I've climbed at the crag, *** for sure and more fun than Celestial Groove.\
\
Here's a buttshot of Dan at the nice rest:\

\
Now we were feeling great, so we went to the right side of the crag and both led Veins of Glory, a face climb with varied moves and a delicate balancy crux through a roof.  A couple parties of cc.commies were there for the rope-up.  We shared our TR with them and chatted while trying to console a distraught dog belonging to another cc.com party.\
\
Milky Way was the last route of the day, two pitches with a stiff stemming start in a corner and lots of fun face and slab climbing.  Two long pitches and rope-stretching rappels later, we hoofed it back down the dusty trail to the leftovers from the morning's trip to the Sultan Bakery awaiting us in the car."
"South-early-winters-spire","Wa Pass ....","... or how to climb to 5.11 alpine rock routes without climbing 5.11 or climbing an alpine rock route.\
\
I was suppose to email Mike directions to my house on friday but didn't end up sending them till about 5minutes before he was suppose to pick me up.  Lucky he woke up late on saturday so neither of us cared.  \
\
We pulled into the hair pin around 930 or so.  And started racking up for EBD on SEWS.  An annoying scree gulley followed and we started climbing around 11:15.  Which was perfect since there is an unspoken rule that you cannot start any route at WA Pass before 11 unless your really ambitious and want to do 2 but thats totally against the chill atmoshpere that the pass can have in the fall.  Got to sit back and enjoy the golden larches.  I don't think we started up the best way but once in the corner route finding becomes more obvious,  I tried to link pitches 2 and 3 but didn't have enough rope so had to endure an annoying hanging belay, thankfully Mike got me out of there resonably quick.  Mike led both the bolt ladders clean despite a short fall on the second one.  I  climbed parts of the first one and then would get confused on where to go so I yarded through those sectsions, I think I pulled on 3 or 4 bolts.  The second one had more straightforward route finding but i still pulled on 2 bolts, the mantle was cool challenging but not desprite.  There is a short exposed step off of a boulder once you top out that got my attention.  Mike rethread the rope through the bolts above it so he too could do it on tr.   a party was just finishing the the sw rib and another on the s arete.  We took a few photos and then started down,  It was almost dark when we got down the south arete perhaps the only descent that I actually enjoy?  So we opted for the less direct but more straightforward descent down to blue lake trail head and then hiked along hwy 20 back to the car.\
\
Sunday some mounties woke us up at 430.  \
Mountie 1 standing 5 feet from my sleeping bag. \"" Think there part of the .... party\""\
Mountie 2  \""I don't know\"" repeat a few times while i was a wake who knows how many times this occured while i was asleep, perhaps they were just going to do it until we woke up.  You know how they have those MOUNTANEER bumper stickers I want to get one that says that but only has a circle and a line through it because being mistaken for a mountie can be really damaging to the ego.\
 thankfully Mike got up and set them straight.  4 hours later we got up for real, made breakfast and thought about what to climb.  We decided on the west face of news which i had already done before but its super sweet and fun stuff like that.  Keeping up with the rule we started climbing at 11:30.  I took 5 or 6 falls trying to free the crux pitch but eventually had to yard though on the fixed stopper.  Mike got it clean but at least he told me he thought it was challenging.  If your going to do this route i recommend letting a different person lead the pitch before and the pitch after the crux since those are the longest and best pitches on route imo.  and of course we were back to the car before the last of the mounties and i was home before 9.  Sweet Weekend thanks MIKE maybe he will post a few photos"
"Ingalls-peaks","Ingalls- South Ridge 6/20/09","Nathan, Allison and I climbed the South Ridge of Ingalls peak Saturday. It was a fun trip and a day of “firsts” for Allison and Nathan; Allison’s first alpine rock climb and Nathan’s first alpine trad leads. 

We left Seattle at about 6:30 and were on the trail by 9:00. Some good conversation (I forget about what) led to me blowing by the Ingalls Pass turn off and hiking 45 minutes towards Esmeralda Basin. Take two: we hiked back and started up the Ingalls Pass turn off at around 10:15. We cruised up to Ingalls pass and shared a rock with 4 goats while we ate our lunch.

Despite the iffy forecast we had beautiful weather and we could finally see our objective; the left skyline.

We continued on, enjoyed some solid 4th class scrambling and were at the start of the route by early afternoon. 

Nathan geared up and led the first pitch.

He brought up Allison and myself and we continued on. We chose the 5.6 variation up the middle crack for the second pitch. Despite the low grade, this 5.6 pitch requires some real crack climbing; another first for Allison.

The weather swept over the ridge during the second pitch and instantly became windy and cold. Made short work of the final pitch and ran over to tag the summit (I decided that Allison and Nathan must stand on the tippy-top of their first alpine rock climb). 
We huddled against the rock, still warm from the sun earlier that day, while the teams ahead made their rappel.

"South-early-winters-spire","EBD of SEWS","Yes, the route is classic, I've done it 3 times and have led every pitch. \
\
Also classic are the finger cracks on W Face of NEWS - climb 4 of 5 in a day that I did on a circuit of the Liberty Bell Group from a couple years ago (leading it with the Mountaineers).\

What I don't understand is the need you seem to feel to degrade parties on other routes, especially if they are parties from the Mountaineers. \

Do you have some inherent need to feel superior?"
"Yellow-aster-butte","Yellow Aster Butte","Jesse and I had Saturday free and wanted to do a challenging scramble somewhere.  I hadn't seen my brother in a month since he moved up to B-ham to go back to school, so I worked out a deal to cut down on the drive for a destination up north and check out my bro's new place.  \
\
Jesse and I thus drove up to Bellingham Friday night and were treated to a special screening in my brother's living room of Hellboy, not many surprises there, pretty mindless action.  A nice night on the couch and Jesse and I drove out the next morning on the Mt Baker highway to the Skyline Divide trailhead to see if we could bag Hadley Peak even with the forecasted low-snow levels and poor weather.  The road is washed out, big time, a few miles in so we turned around and picked another destination.  \
\
Went up to the Yellow Aster Butte trail with dreams of getting close to Tomyhoi and we started hiking in a light rain.  The rain turns to snow about 4500 feet and the ground is totally covered soon after.  Whiteout conditions follow and it becomes obvious that off-trail travel on Tomyhoi will be impossible.  We resolve ourselves to head up a scramble path to the top of Yellow Aster Butte,  a small peak that looks impressive in the scrambles guide, and subject ourselves to fierce, cold winds on the ridge line.  We didn't get the challenge we were expecting, and could barely see our tracks in the snow to get down, but good times nonetheless.  \
\
A few miles back down the Mt Baker highway from the trailhead we drove around a bend and came upon a boulder taking up our lane about as big as Jesse's Camry.  Scary to think something that big could come down on the road anytime;  there wasn't even a particularly large road cut there.  We drove carefully around the rock and its smaller debris and stopped to report the blockage at the Glacier Ranger Station.  Saw the after-effects of a few more accidents on the way home, definitely not quality climbing or driving weather, but if you're determined you can still get out in the hills and enjoy yourself."
"Mount-rainier","Camp Muir Hike","No one else seem excited about doing a TR so I thought I'd give it a shot.

Last Saturday, Jackie, Mason, Amit tai, his friend Martin, a Chicagoan Genie and I hiked up to Camp Mir.

We planned to meet up at the 65th P&amp;R at 7:30 and then make a quick coffee stop before making the long drive south. Of course plans only work out when all the stars are aligned and everyone has good karma, but this time our delay was laughable. Firstly, our 'quick' coffee stop turned into a relaxing sit down where most of us enjoyed Vivance's coffee. Secondly, there was some confusion in how many people would be coming on this trip so plans were made to only take one car. As we were about to leave Vivance, we discovered that we were about to unknowing leave one person stranded on 65th street. To resolve, Jackie and Mason left to pick up Genie while Amit tai, Martin and myself walked back to Amit tai's place to get another car.

By the time we left Paradise to begin the hike up it was already 12:00. Worming though the maze of trails between Paradise and Glacier Vista brought up to the turn off for Skyline high trial. While Amit tai did point out that we should probably turn back and head north on the Pebble Creek trail, I think we were too lazy to walk back 20 meters and decided to continue anyway. This Skyline high trail quickly dissolved into imaginary segments of trail, but old bamboo flags and single rock cairns were reassuring so we continued onward. I have to admit that this point of the trip in which visibility was limited to perhaps 5 to 10 meters was maybe the funnest time I've ever had in the mountains.

Eventually we decided to abandon the ridge and head for a snow field a little to the East. It turned out to be the Muir snowfield and hiking up it was undoubtedly the most boring as we had a decent path of foot prints to follow. At around 8000 ft, the sky suddenly cleared and we stopped for a decently long break. From below Anvil Rock, Mason led a quick pace up to Muir, quickly followed by Martin while Amit tai admirably played sweeper.

We didn't spend long at Muir as clouds were rolling up and it was past 6:00. After an initial snag in the decent we finally got moving. At random points along the decent people had carved out little or sometimes lengthy shoots which made glissading possible in the otherwise wet snow.

By the time we reached Paradise again, I believe it was around 8:30 and seeking to return quickly we forwent the usually stop for abnormally delicious food. Mason, Jackie and Genie were not so lucky as their alternator died and I assume returned much later.

Overall it was an awesome hike albeit much longer than we were intending, but what can be done about people's different abilities. Next time I'm bringing a sled for the decent though!"
"Kaleetan-peak","Kaleetan Peak and &quot;The sickest apline light ever!&quot;","Sunday, a big group of us headed out to scramble Kaleetan Peak up in Snoqualmie Pass.  Our group included such stalwart veteran photographers as Josh Stern and John Jantz, speed demons Ben and Dallas, and a couple of new faces: Valerie, Lissa (who has a [i:14p0wnfc]great[/i:14p0wnfc] joke to tell), Lindsay, Eric, and Gillian.  And thanks to Matt Peters for clueing us in on the access road outage!\
\
Reached the trailhead in good order (using a road Josh didn't think existed) around 7:30 and headed up the Denny Creek Trail.  Morning weather was foggy and cloudy with limited, but cool visibility.  Made good time to Melawka Lake and located the climber's trail to Kaleetan (coincidentally also the route to the outhouse).  Once on the climber's trail, things became more interesting - including fleeting views of Chair Peak, scrambling of wet root ladders, and more water in Josh Stern's boots than he cared for (thanks again for breaking trail).  The route follows the ridgeline most of the way to Kaleetan, than drops down the back side about 500 feet, before regaining the ridge via a talus field.  It might be possible to stay on the ridge (exposed 2nd - 3rd class?) but we did not.  Back on the ridge we made short work of the remaining scramble to the summit and were rewarded with a panorama of big, white, fluffy clouds. Fortunately, a marker block near the summit told us that if we could actually see anything, there are a number of peaks in the area.  Midway through our afternoon repast of peanuts, banana chips, humus, and che-eese, the clouds broke somewhat and were were treated to intermittent views of Snow Lake, Chair Peak, and I-90.  \
\
On the return trip, Josh and John encountered, \""the sickest alpine light I've ever seen\"" and managed to shoot lots of good pictures.  They promise to show them by 2006.  Really.  I think they're going to make good on this promise.  \
\
I think everyone had a great time on some pretty challenging terrain.  Nice to see new and old faces.  Hopefully we can get some more trips in before the snows come and all thoughts turn to skis, snowboards, and snowshoes.\
\
And of course, good times had by all."
"leavenworth-area-climbs","Playground Point and BeBop Rock","Sunday the weather looked good in Leavenworth, so G and I headed to Icicle Creek for some climbing.  We first headed to Playground Point and quickly found the climbs.  Last time I was there we searched for 2+ hrs w/o success.  I lead Baby Steps (5.4) followed by Hopscotch (5.6) and Father's Day (5.7).  I looked at Romper Room (5.8+) and decided to have a go at it.  It went pretty well, all the holds are pretty good.  I did pull on a quick draw once, since I was pretty nervous at that point.  It was definitely the most challenging lead I've done, but it was really fun.  We then headed back to Birthday Boy (5.7), which was a very fun lead.  \
\
After Playground Point, we decided to head over to BeBop Rock.  We wandered through the woods for over an hour before we heard voices.  We went to go ask where we were and quickly realized we were at BeBop Rock.  (Note:  The map in Leavenworth Rock is not really accurate).  It was getting late, so I lead Junior's Cooking (5.6) and set up a TR on Bit of Heaven (5.10a) for G.  He climbed it; I would have too but was anxious to lead Melodious Thunk (5.7).  I started up but realized it would be dark in less than half an hour, so I backed off.  I'm excited to have another go at it though.  Through the trees we had a great view of a snow covered Stuart, with a plume of clouds blowing over the summit.\
\
Over the course of the day, I taught G to rappel and build a simple anchor off bolts.  He climbs at the IMA semi-regularly, but his was his second trip outdoors, and he really enjoyed it.  All in all we had a great day at Leavenworth"
,"Enchantments","I wasn't sure what I wanted to do this weekend.  I desperately needed some mountain air, but I also desperately needed to get some work done.  In the past week, I had only one evening just for myself, and I was itchiing for some alone time.  Kevin had his partner bail for his Enchantments trip, and Kevin and I are close enough friends that I could be with him and still feel like I'm getting my alone time.  \
\
After a groggy post-party start Saturday morning, Kevin and I were on the way to the Enchantments, with high hopes to climb the WR of Prusik.  The ground was nearly dry, and lake levels were low as we hiked up.  The sky had patches of blue.  We realized we forgot trekking poles for our Betamid -- no problem, we found some sticks that worked almost as wel.\
\
We arrived at Gnome Tarn right around a lightless sunset.  The clouds were moving in.  We wolfed down dinner of cheese ravioli pasta with tomato pesto and fresh wild mushrooms (boletus edulis).  Then the weather hit.  At some point early in the night, our Betamid collapsed under the weight of the falling snow.  Throughout the remainder of the night, we really wouldn't sleep much -- it was a continual fight keeping the tent up.  In the morning, there were nearly six inches of freshiez on the ground and now sign of letting up.  And it was damn cold and windy.  We hastily packed up camp.  My water filter was buried in the snow on the edge of our tent, and I forgot about it.  The hike from Gnome Tarn to Lake Vivian was treacherous with the new snow on top of granite slabs.  Several times we glissaded down short slopes.  At Lake Vivian, there wasn't nearly as much snow, maybe an inch or two.  And on the approach slabs just to the east, no snow at all.  But the trail was a veritable stream.  \
\
The rest of the hike out in the rain was uneventful, aside from the time that I was staring at my feet and walked my head into a fallen tree hanging a little shy of six feet above the trail.  Luckily my wool hat provided some cushioning.  When we got to the car, we found that we had been ticketed by the tool.  We had accidently put on last year's forest pass instead of this year's (both, along with two volunteer day passes, were in the glovebox).  So we drove to the Ranger Station to fix things.  We saw an old fat dude in a big green FS law enforcement truck, so we tried to talk with him.  \
\
Little did we know we encountered the infamous Larry the Tool.  We showed him the ticket and all our passes, and he was basically like, \""I can't do anything to help you.  You have to take it up with the guy who ticketed you.\""\
\""Is he here?\""\
\""No.  Try tomorrow morning.\""\
\""But we're going back to Seattle tonight.\""\
\""You can call.\""\
\""But how is he going to believe us that we have the passes? That's why we want to show them in person to a ranger to prove it.\""\
\""That's not my problem.\""\
\
Larry the Tool then went on a rant about how people try to lie and claim that they mistakenly were given tickets when in fact they didn't have their passes on them, and Larry started pointing out thousands of dollars of gadgets in his shiny new pickup truck (laptop, digital camera, video camera, etc.), that he uses to enforce the Fee Demo.  He said that he takes photos of the license plate, of the windshield and dashboard, the car at the trailhead, etc., so he can prove to the judge in court that he is right.  He even had the nerve to say that people would probably think he's a prowler when he's garnering his evidence -- the Forest Service has done next to nothing to curb car breakins.  (Who wants to bet that your fee demo dollars went straight to Larry the Tool's laptop, digicam, and video camera?)\
\
So all in all, the trip pretty much sucked, but it was still good to get the mountain air, and Kevin was great company as usual.  Hopefully this week will be a little less stressful."
"Sunshine-wall","Vantage","Went to Vantage on the 10th for some rock in the sun. Spent the whole day at the Sunshine wall, and climbed some very fine routes. Go get some desert while it lasts!\

"Ingalls-peaks","Ingalls Lake 10/23/04","On Saturday Kevin, Stephanie, Ethan, Nick, Lindsay, Ben, Lissa, Dallas, Aaron, and myself headed out to the Teanaway area to take a shot at Ingalls Peak.  I wasn't sure what to expect on the ground or in the sky, but what we found was snow.  Lots and lots of snow.  Starting at Ingalls Pass, snow deeper than a foot in places, blanketing the basin in winter.  By the time we reached Ingalls Lake, the peak was completely socked in and, after some consideration, we decided it didn't make sense to make a push for the summit.  The wind, snow, and general cold didn't stop Ben from swimming in Ingalls Lake, but given how fast he popped back out of the water, I think even he thought it was a little chilly.  \
\
We scrambled (\""sporty\"" mixed class 2) up an unnamed ridge on the way back to Ingalls Pass and had some decent views of the area and the flanks of Stuart - but the clouds kept everything pretty hidden.  Snow fell on us the whole way back to the cars, though not sticking very much other than our packs at lower elevations.  Rounded out the day with dinner and drinks at The Brick in Roslyn.  \
\
Good times had by all.  Only rain that fell on us was while leaving The Brick.   <!-- s:D --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\"" alt=\"":D\"" title=\""Very Happy\"" /><!-- s:D -->\

\
\
I would like to think that those were the lyrics going through my head most of \
day yesterday.  But truth be told I was mostly focusing on the climbing. \
Before i get to into the tr I would like to say a little about soloing.  I have \
never posted solo tr's before mainly because i don't do to much of it and \
always thought it to be taboo.  Soloing is very personal, dangerous, and it \
may come across that i'm glamourizing it.  But if anyone goes out and solos \
something or thinks it okay to solo something because of a tr I wrote on the \
internet then they need to have their head examined.  I'm writing this to share \
an awesome day with my friends....\
\
So this punk driven tr is dedicated to my friend Ralph so that he hopefully \
won't consider me a hippy.  And hopefully yesterday he didn't....\

As with any weekday trip getting out the house proves to be the crux.  First I couldn't find my lucky convertible pant/shorts but was able to attach the legs of those to another pair.  I had retired the other pair do to a rip from the zipper to the waist belt along the crouch.  Then my mom took the truck causing a 2 hour delay.  My parents are getting very good at figuring out when i'm going climbing the usual routine i suppose, take pack, sleeping bag and food out to the car.  I Finally slipped out of the house but forgot the orbit route description.  Slide back in to find my Dad calling my bs yes i was skipping class tommorow to go \""hiking around leavenworth\""  Why? My mom wanted to know, she still thinks its dangerous to go hiking by yourself.\

\
I wake cold and nervous Thursday morning.  Starting the stove because I don't know what else to do besides staying comfortably in my sleeping which I would only regret later.  \
\
At 8am I leave the car and head up RandD.  Still not my favorite route but the feeling of moving over rock calms my nerves.\
\
9am I begin hiking up snow creek trail.  The weight of my pack, a full rack and 10mm 60mm rope, is a direct reflection of my nerves at that moment.  I get nervous before every multipitch route I ever climb and usually try desperatly to hide this from my partner, today all I can do is look inside and ask if I am capable and confident in soloing these routes.  Despite the pack weight I still reach orbit in less than an hour.  Moving up the \""first\"" pitch everything feels good.  I climb into the chimney hmm awkard up down, down up I can't commit to the moves with out pro.  I take my rope and tie in, equalize the fixed pin and a #1 costalot as an anchor than clip the fixed cam as pro.  Make the moves no probelm and soon I'm stuffing in 3 cams and rapping down to clean my gear and climb it again on tr.  The 5.6 lieback flake goes smoothly I bipass the 5.9 finger crack but still have to pull a small roof to get onto the slab.  This I believe is still part of the 5.9 section it took me three or four minutes to work out moves I was comfortable with.  That section dedicated the theme for this route because there was a lot of 5.8 face climbing forcing me to take my time often posing for a minute to find the right way to do the moves.  Soon, however, I was dancing amongst a sea of jugs and chickenheads then topping out laughing.  Yelling back down the wall laughing.\
\
\""So here I am holding on to what I can, pertending I am a superman\""\
\
\""Go back against the wall\""\
\
After orbit I climbed outerspace leaving the rope behind this time.  The traverse although techincally the hardest pitch of the day went smoothly.  I had all week to work the moves in my head since i had already done it twice, a handjam to a jug to a hand jam to fingerlocks and another beatiful hand jam.  The rest of the route went smoothly I bipassed the 5.9 fingercrack with a one move 5.8 traverse on good holds.  Outerspace was mentally a much easier solo for me mostly jamming.  To give you an idea i was 1 hour and 45 minutes on orbit and 38 on outerspace.\
\
Reaching the snow creek parking lot it start to sprinkle lightly which I found extremely disappointing since I had one more route in my enchaintment, Castle Rock.  I went to Safeway gased up and drove out to Castle Rock.  The weather was fine in Tumwater Canyon and I still had 3 hours of daylight so I made myself some hot cocco and ate a few peanut butter crackers.  I was totally in the moment there I head my headphones on covered up by my moms tri color 1970's style toque, my ripped bi-color pants, and the 1997 Nike Airs jamming away, got some interesting looks from people driving along highway 2.  Eventually I started climbing again did the fault/canapult/midway link up.  I think the first pitch of midway 5.5 was the sketchest thing all day.  The upper part was really cool there is one spot where you tunnel though this chimney its sick.  On the top of castle rock I was laughing and yelling out into the canyon.  Not sure why perhaps I felt overjoyed about the link up I had just soloed, perhaps I was happy that I got \""away\"" with it or maybe its because i wasn't supposed to do it.  I'm still laughing about it.\
\
When I got home my Dad lectured me on skipping class and how in 5.5 years of college he never skipped a single class.  I desprately wanted to tell my parents what I had just done how perfect I had been all day there was not a single move in over 2000ft of rock I would take back or redo, I felt confident and in control at all times.  But I couldn't tell my parents this all I could do was smile nod say okay and think about how much more I would have learned about myself in phsycology class.\

I'm going to come back and reread/edit this it took much longer to write than i orginally thought"
,"Post Ice Cragging @ Baker TR","I'm beginning to wonder; is it just my luck on Halloween weekend or on ice climbing weekend?  Last year we got lost and never got to ice climb.  This year we didn't make it all the way to the trailhead, and had to walk half a mile, but we got to ice climb.  Leaving was much more interesting.  It all started with only getting to eat one brownie out on the glacier (thanks btw) so maybe I wasn't hyper enough.  Anyways, on the drive out  Aaron made me go crazy and caused my performance car (the Camry) to go off the road.  So then we were stuck.  Then Aaron decided, hey lets go for a run, hiking isn't fast enough.  So we ran downhill for somewhere between 2 & 4 miles before the ski guy we all passed on the way out caught up to us & gave us a lift into Glacier.  \
\
So we called Aarons brother in Bham, who was kind enough to drive out & pick us up so we could sleep at his house (for the 3rd weekend in October) & we cooked up some Tapatio pasta with seasame seeds on the bench in front of the restaurant while we waited.   Then we got to watch a video of Aaron rapelling in Mexico and then getting his head ripped off & thrown into the ocean by a ninja.  Then we went to sleep (with still no stop at the Pub & Casino in Bham).  The next morning Erik's dad was driving up in his truck to see if he could pull my car out with it.  But first, Aaron had to pop a zit.  \
[img:1wojhyrb]http&#58;//www&#46;lotusmedia&#46;org/ruby/camera/europe2k/images/28_zit_ad_png&#46;jpg[/img:1wojhyrb]\
Only it was on my head, and not his.  But thats fine, because Erik got us some breakfast, which was good.  But he wouldn't let us meet his sister, which is lame because word is she's hot.  <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\"" alt=\"":lol:\"" title=\""Laughing\"" /><!-- s:lol: --> \
\
So we drove on up to my car to discover it had snowed some more.  Someone else tried helping us pull the car out using Erik's rope (who wants to lead with it next?) But the car just kept sliding farther and farther.  Of course everyone claimed I weighed the least, so I had to sit in the car and give it gas when its clearly obvious that I outweigh Aaron.\

\
Anyways, apparently the seatbelt was broken, so I had to worry about something else going crappy with my week.  But I made it out of the car, but the car is stuck, with the back wheel in the air, so to top off my week this is my prediction as to what I'll see when I return.\
[img:1wojhyrb]http&#58;//www&#46;sannaranch&#46;com/Car-Explosion&#46;JPG[/img:1wojhyrb]\

On the upside, we did get to eat sandwiches at Eriks on the way home, which were really good.  Unfortunately, there was no hot sister, just a younger brother. <!-- s:P --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\"" alt=\"":P\"" title=\""Razz\"" /><!-- s:P --> \

"Mount-stuart","Stuart - West Ridge","Eric and I had a great time climbing the West Ridge of Stuart yesterday.  We left the Ingalls/Esmerelda trailhead at about 8am, and made the approach partly on foot and partly with snowshoes.  The ridge was a lot of fun, snowy rock climbing, with bits of ice here and there.  We brought crampons, but never ended up using them.  We topped out right at sunset, and immediately started the descent to try to make use of the last bit of light.  We put on our headlamps below the false summit, and then spent a long time wandering in the wind and sleet, trying to decide where Cascadian Couloir was.  After a lot of heming-and-hawing we ended up in Cascadian, and were on our way to arrive back at the car at 12:15."
"Eldorado-peak","Eldorado - NW Couloir","Ken and I climbed the NW couloir on Eldorado this weekend in a rather slim 12 hour window of good weather.  It was a fun and reasonably short route with some good ice and a lot of neve. Definitely a long ways out there though!\

"Mount-watson","A Spoonless Ascent of Mt. Watson","Kevin Steffa and I hiked up to Mt. Watson Friday under clear skies and with a fine, hard snowpack for the feet.  From below the summit crag, we had great views of lenticular clouds stacking up over Baker, Shuksan, and the Pickets.  A bit of the ol' fourth-class got us to the top.  Gray skies moved in amazingly fast, so down we went to pick out a campsite on the north-side snowfield and poke around the glacier terminus until we ran out of daylight.\

\
While making dinner back at the Betamid, Kevin and I realized that neither of us had brought a cup or a spoon.  We had no knifeblade pitons, the traditional eating utensil substitute, so I improvised with the lid from my can of sardines while Kevin scooped with the pesto container.  I found that Tasty Bites can also easily be drunk straight from the pouch.  Some emergency stove maintenance helped kill time while we wondered when the snow would start falling.\
\
I can't remember the last time I went to bed at 7.30pm, but there wasn't much else to do until about 5, when I started punching snow off the tent walls.  We slogged down in a whiteout until some lakes, then kicked off the snowshoes and squished back to the car.  My Trango S' will never be waterproof.\
\
We wound our way back home over a series of detours: roadside cloudwatching, Baker Lake, downtown Concrete, mossy maples, a staggering view of Marble Creek Cirque, and a bouncy trip down the Suiattle River Road in a frustrated search for a look at Whitechuck/Pugh/Sloan all in a row.\

"Mount-rainier","Paradise - Muir conditions on Rainier","Amanda and I skiied up to Camp Muir on Sat (Nov 20).  There are a couple of feet of snow on the ground, little enough to read the signs telling you where you are, but definitely enough to skin and ski on.  The snow near Paradise was awesome, about 3-4 inches of Cascade powder, staying powdery thanks to the low temps (subfreezing in the morning, just a degree or two above by late afternoon).  The last few hundred yards before Muir were kind of icy.  The 75% of the route inbetween was just like a groomed run.\
\
We unintentially skiied off-route and ended up skiing over some rocks.  I've been told the gouges in the bottoms of my skis are easily fixable with some stuff called P-Tex.  The weather was incredible, with a view of Adams, St. Helens, and Hood.  There were fewer than a dozen people ahead of us and only about 4 behind on the route to Muir, so it wasn't crowded at all (for that route)."
"Rock-mountain","Rock Mountain","Chris Cass, Ryan Forsyth, and myself headed to Rock Mountain, hoping that the name wouldn't be any indication of the snow.  We hiked up in our tennies for the first 2000 feet and then put the skiis on.  Two thousand feet later, we were at the top.  There were a few rocks at the very top that I discovered, but otherwise good coverage.  The snow was good -- what we call Cascades \""powder\"" -- which made for slow lazy turns.  \
\
We ran into a nice couple enroute.  Turns out the guy is a math prof at Seattle Comm College.  I quizzed him about how he likes his job and how much vacation  he gets.  He told me that they have a hard time hiring CS people because the pay is low.  SWEET!\

The snow was thin, but the company was good, the air crisp and clear, and the scenery lovely.  It was was good to get outside for a bit, and we were able to get a few turns in.  We skinned up to the saddle between Cowboy and Big Chief and then followed the ridge over to Big Chief.  We soaked up the views and the sun before picking our way back down through the rocks.  \

,"Maple Pass ski","Last Sunday nine hardy souls got up bright and early to meet at the 65th P&R to head up to Rainy Pass.  Even hardier was Lindsay -- though she couldn't go herself, she brought homemade brownies for us!\
\
Hwy20 had compacted snow on it, but we made it to Rainy Pass without a hitch.  The weather was good, with partly cloudy skies.  As we skinned toward the pass, the clouds grew thicker, and snow came down.  We got some turns in over a foot of fresh before we headed back as it got dark.  Though there was a foot of fresh, the base was low, and there were the occasional rock and bush jutting out.  The way down was the most \""interesting;\"" we'd gain speed from flying down the straights of the trail and then have to turn on a dime at the switchback, with rocks and bushes forming a gauntlet on either side of the trail.  But we all made it down unhurt.  It was a great day in the snow with great company and great food, that also included homemade apple pie, hot tea with honey, wasabi chips, and other items I cannot remember.\

"The-tooth","Tooth","Jason Killgore and I climbed the south side of the Tooth yesterday in exciting conditions.  The wind was blowing quite hard which made the climb decidedly colder and more interesting.  The belaying and rappelling was exhausting as we had to fight the wind, and both our faces were pretty burnt by the icy gusts.  Winter rock climbing is just all-around harder.  Had some decent views of Glacier Peak and Rainier despite the overcast skies, and lamented the mostly crappy thin-crust snow conditions; the skiers we saw heading out for who knows where that morning must have had an interesting time, bet that sucked.  \
\
The cat track out of the upper parking lot was bare ground when we left, don't expect the lifts to be running at Alpental anytime soon."
"Guye-peak","Guye Peak, East Gully","No skiing? Shite. Josh, Melisa, Stephanie and I fought off our depression regarding the snow conditions by investigating Guye Peak, and the fun-sounding East Gully which Josh had been up before. The cool thing about Guye and the short approach is that you can sleep in until 8:15 on almost the darkest day of the year and still make the summit! \
As with any GP route, the crux was finding the gully entrance. In this case, additional difficulties were encountered dealing with hard-but-still-breakable crust conditions and poor snow coverage. The crusty post-holing sucked so bad I almost wanted to bail. Well, we didn't bail, we found the gully on our first try, and crappy breakable crust turned into quite nice styrofoamy snow higher up, so things definitely got better as we kept going. Snow coverage was indeed minimal, though, with only about a foot on the flats and less on the steeps. This turned what should have been a simple 40-45 degree snow romp into a much more interesting mixed venture, with some rock moves, some pure snow, some ice, and some veggie pulling. We never put crampons on, although they probably would have made things quite a bit simpler. Howling winds kept things exciting as well. We made it to the top in fine form, held on to our lunches in the gale, shook our heads at the sad sight of Alpental, and scrambled down. Good times."

,"Surprise Lake/Glacier Lake Snowshoe - 1/9/05","Motivated by the sight of fresh snow covering the group in Seattle, Charles, Melinda, Thais, and I headed out on Route 2 for the first snowshoeing of 2005.  \
\
Snow at the trailhead at 2200 feet, deepening steadily to Surprise Lake.  Avalanche chutes along trail have very little snow, as yet, and pose limited risk.  Solid bootrack all the way to Surprise Lake - which was covered by a pristine layer of new snow.  After eating lunch, donned snowshoes and headed up the valley to Glacier Lake.  \
\
Some nice views of Spark Plug Mtn from Glacier Lake.  More than a foot of fresh powder in the upper meadows.\
\
Does anyone know if the \""Shelter\"" shown on the USGS map east of Glacier Lake along the PCT is still in existence?  We weren't sure if we missed it in the snow or it's gone the way of the dodo.\

Pictures to follow."
,"Cabin creek X-c loop","After outings over the holidays at Gatineau Park (near Ottawa) and La Mauricie National Park in Quebec (two of the best x-c areas on the continent), I knew the local offerings weren't going to be too impressive (Methow excluded, I'm told, but that's far). Still, after an evening of listening to some amazing bluegrass tunes down in Portland and jamming 'till the wee hours, a couple hour burn at the pass sounded like good idea. \
\
Melisa and I figured out the irritating procedure involving the snow park pass/ special groomed fee permit, blah blah blah, and finally got the skinny boards on sometime in the early afternoon. The cabin creek loop is something like 9 km, with a couple of optional loops in there. We did one tour around the full loop, including the one big hill, and it was fun, albeit a bit bare (some rocks, shrubs sticking out of the trail). This week's dump will hopefully come and cover things up a bit more. \
\
So this was my second time on the cabin creek loop, and while Seattleites rave about it, it seemed pretty piddling by my (elitest) eastern x-c standards. I mean, 9 km just gets old after a couple of laps. I guess that's why backcountry is big out here and cross country is big further east, in the land of rolling hills. Still, I always enjoy going skiing, and we had fun just getting a quick bit of exercise in before dark. For what it's worth, the weekend highlight was definitely wathching the Del McCoury band rock the house on Saturday night in P-town. Yeeeeeehaw!\
\
If anyone has any good local x-c spots they'd recommend at the sub-$10 (daily) level, I'm all ears. I know the Summit (Hyak) network is decent, but at $15 a pop (and one lift ride used by most), it's not really my idea of what x-c skiing is about."
,"Marten's Creek","I'm developing a backlog of trip reports.  So I'll start this one.  Kevin, Lindsay, Mark Swanson, Stephanie, and myself headed up the Mtn Loop last Sunday intending to Forgotten.  But the road was closed, so we settled for Marten's Creek.  Mark the Treenerd fascinated with his identifications and explanations of the old growth.  We had the what-is-now-expected diverse sampling of tasty treats.  A great time was had by all.  \

,"Heather Ridge","Terra and I wandered through the glades today up to the top of Heather Ridge.  Lots of fresh snow up there.\
It was one of her first times out with her backcountry setup*.  We followed track for a while, and then the track looked like it was going flat/downhill (likely towards Skyline Lake).  Being an aficionado for knobs, I pressed up the steepening timbered slope to the top even though she was hesitant.  I guess I forgot what it was like to be a beginner (even though I still consider myself a sucky skiier who can't do a decent jump turn) .  I think I was plenty happy to be skinning without bushwhacking -- something I've grown used to on a Steffa trip.  But anyway, kickturns up a steep slope can be daunting for a beginner.  And my likely selective memory didn't recall anything too gnarly the last time I had been up there -- I kept on telling her, incorrectly, to push through it because it will be better soon.   We made it to the top, but at the expense of Terra's fun tickets.  Decent views from the knob, but unfortunately there was clear sky directly over us and clouds obscuring the mountains to the north.  She lost a few more fun-tickets when she accidently bumped herself in the jaw with a ski pole while she was rummaging through her pack.  We slowly picked our way down the first 200 feet or so -- she was losing more fun tickets -- I had forgotten how groomers don't prepare one for survival skiing, tight trees,  skiing with skins, etc., and I was overestimating her skiing ability.  Once the slope mellowed out, she got her fun tickets back, minus a jaw-ache.  The snow was deep, heavy Cascades powder making for slow lazy turns.  The turns were good, but I didn't enjoy them as much as I had hoped -- maybe her deficit of fun tickets was rubbing off on me, or maybe I'm becoming a snobbier skiier, as I would have enjoyed a steeper line, or a line not interrupted by switchbacks on the road.  Despite the fun-ticket tax, we still had a good time, and we each learned from the experience.\
\
* She still needs to get BC boots -- we learned that Alpine boots don't perform well for skinning, even when unbuckled."
,"Mountain Loop Lunancy - aka, Pilot Ridge Snowshoe (1/15/05)","The Darrington Rangers are indeed good to their word - the Mountain Loop is driveable from Darrington all the way to the washout at Bedal.  Though I wouldn't recommend doing much more than tapping your brakes as your drive unless your idea of fun is to be fished out of the Stillagaumish by a tow truck.\
\
The Mountain Loop is covered by packed snow and ice starting at the White Chuck and kind of icy all the way from the center of Darrington.  Though the snow does do a bit to even out the potholes.  FR 49 to the trailhead is where the fun really starts (who knew snow could make such interesting shapes?) and alternates between powder and packed powder all the way to the North Fork Sauk Trailhead.  Road conditions deteriorate a bit beyond this point, but for now it looks like a moderate clearance AWD vehicle (aka subaru) could make it all the way to the Bald Eagle trailhead.\
\
But I digress...  Eric, Nick, Rok, Melinda, Thais, Thais' friend (phoenetically Rhahim), myself, and Ben headed up the North Fork Sauk trail under cloudy skies.  We had a spectacular view of Sloan Peak on the way up before dropping into the old growth forest along the banks of the river.  I have rarely seen such enormous old-growth cedars and hemlocks.  The log crossing to get to Pilot Ridge was a bit tenuous (as snow covered logs usually are), but we got across in good order and headed up the endless switchbacks to Pilot Ridge.  As the snow deepened, we donned our snowshoes, and marvelled as Ben tirelessly broke trail towards the elusive ridge.  Regrettably, we hit our turnaround time about 500' below the really good views, but that's what happens when you try to snowshoe in deep powder.  Fun glissades on the way down.  Props to Melinda for driving.  \
\
Good times had by all.  Of course.\

Bug Ben and Eric to post their pictures."
"Sunshine-wall","Vantage","A friend an I decided to gamble on a risky forecast and see if we could get some climbing in.  30% chance of rain, foggy, highs in the mid 40s.  Well, might as well sit int he car for a few hours, because the weather will surely chew in Seattle.\

We should of climbed \""Das Toof\"" instead.  I saw it was free of snow when we went over the pass, 1.5 hrs ago.  But the slog would have sucked since there was virtually no snow at the pass.\
\
We packed up and hiked over to sunshine wall.  The falls were awesome.  frozen and scenic, but you could here the water flowing from across the valley.  The ice tools were of no use today.  Periodically throughout the day, we would here ice chunks crashing down.\

\
The rock was totally dry, but bone chillingly cold.  I resorted to jams most of the first climb simply because I couldn't fee my fingers enough.  Despite my trad instincts, today would not be trad.   Most important piece of gear = down coat.\
\
We climbed Party in your pants, Hakuna Matata, Throbbing Gristle, and Ride 'em Cowboy.\
Surprisingly enough, we saw about 8 other people there too.   \
\
Most of the day saw the Coulee socked in with fog.  So, most of the photos I took wound up looking like this:\

,"^","Oh wow. I wondered what it looked like out there this weekend. I thought for sure you would report a blue bird day with highs in the 70s! I didn't think it would be so cold. Great you got out! In January... wow.  I better get stronger in a hurry, looks like rock season is starting really early this year."
,"Tronsen Ridge-22 January 2005","With a forecast promising to soak the west-side and the week’s balmy temperatures and rain melting the mountain snow pack, we decided that this weekend it was time to head east of the Cascade crest to where canyon lands meet Ponderosa forests.  Come Saturday morning, we encountered a surprise: lowland fog had settled in just east of Snoqualmie Pass and it gave no indication of lifting by the time we reached Cle Elum.  Thanks to Kevin’s atlas and familiarity with weather patterns in the region, we determined we’d jog a little north instead of traveling further east; in hopes of finding high country above the clouds and away from the rain.\
\
Mid-morning found Gary, Dave, Kevin, Mark, Nate, Nick, Rok and myself just north of Blewett Pass headed up to Tronsen Ridge.  We blazed through Ponderosa Pine and Interior Douglas-fir forest, eschewing the Forest Services roads and trails that crisscrossed the area. The terrain was a mix of open forest, grassy outcrops, rocky slopes and sagebrush.  Ascending the ridge, we gained views of the Stuart Range-its base anyway, the peaks themselves were hidden in the clouds-and found patches of snow ample enough for a few snowballs.  We followed the ridgeline to the high point of rocky outcroppings, sandstone slabs, wind swept pines and brilliant orange lichens.  The sun made an appearance as we foraged on wasabi cashews (props to Gary!), varieties of Gouda and-of course-assorted baked goods.  After lunch, we spent some time scrambling the rocky outcrops and lounging on a sandstone spire with excellent views.  Looking east from the top, there was a sea of clouds extending past the Columbia Basin, its banks lapping at the edge of the eastern Cascade foothills.  The trip down entailed a catnap in the sun accompanied by flute music, as well as photo ops of the cloud formations and a wolf lichen fortress.  We ended the day with a stop at the Issaquah Brewery to sample some of the fine dark beers made by the folks at Rouge.  Good times had by all."

2/10/05 Thursday\
\
I joined a small posse and spent the day above the still unfrozen Source Lake today.  The Rap wall had a good amount of ice on it.  I led the M7 that is named after some rapper, although I forget who.  Wasn't Chuck D, wasn't RZA, it was further right, although since about 5 people know the names of the routes up there it is irrelevant.  At one point I had both crampons and both tools with full-on sticks in ice.  It was righteous.  Also climbed the M6, which coincidentally shares the same name as some rapper.  Then I took a whirl on TR on Gourou, the gymnastic M9 roof left of the cave.  Extremely fun.  I made it partway through the first crux before swinging out into space and nearly planting my crampons in my belayer's head.\
\
It was a beautiful, cold sunny day, an excellent outing with a fun crowd, conditions were great on the wall.  Ice season continues!!!!  Grivel Racing Wings get a big thumbs up as a mixed tool."

Met Dan and Kurt, who were also going in to climb Colchuck, at Eightmile campground who shared the light trail-breaking duties with us on the way in.  If you had high-clearance you could drive a ways up the ungated road over the foot or two of snow there to save some walking.  \

\
We stopped to rope up on the edge of the couloir where there was some more technical-looking climbing above and the route rounded a corner making the runout unclear,\
\
[img:33dnro5e]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/zman2208/colchuckNEBC15&#46;jpg[/img:33dnro5e]\
\
Put in a picket to hang our packs while we dealt with the rope and watched as spindrift slides became larger and more forceful.  They were turning the top few inches of the couloir into a river of sugar snow.  After one particularly large billowing cloud of spind drift I said, \""Let's get out of here.\""  Jason concurred remarking how steeper climbing would be darn hard with that coming down.  We started to put the rope away to climb down when a low rumbling caught my attention and I looked up in time to see something huge coming down the pipe.  \""Get down!\""  We hugged our tools and the picket and leaned to the left edge of the slot.  The small avalanche passed over us with the main volume of snow carving a runnel in the middle of the couloir.  My coat and gloves had filled with snow and we beat a hasty retreat back to the relative safety of the glacier on the way back to camp, car, and home.   Glad we stopped when we did, just around the next corner, the runout would have been blocked by the walls of the gully.  \
\
There's not much ice or snowpack up there, so only mixed climbs are available on the usually solid ice climbs on Colchuck and Dragontail."
"Baring-mountain","Baring attempt","On Saturday my friend Mike and I attempted to attempt Kyes Peak.  At\
6:30 we were turning off Hwy 2 at Index to head up to the Blanca Lake\
trailhead when we saw that the road was closed several miles shy of\
the trailhead.  Not wanting to make an already long day that much\
longer, we headed back down to the Index Cafe to get some breakfast\
and consider our options.  We ate eggs, sausage, coffee and decided on\
Baring.  \
\
Lacking a description of any kind, we went to the Barclay Lake\
trailhead and headed down the abandoned logging road until it became\
too overgrown, then headed up into the forest.  It started misting as\
we bushwhacked up an avalanche slope covered with over-head-high slide\
alder.  Once we got above the avalanche slope into the trees, the\
brush got thinner and shorter, but the ground was still fairly steep,\
and the rain was turning to snow.  There was enough snow to make things\
slippery, but it was not consolidated enough to take steps.  So we were\
mostly yarding ourselves up on alder and tree roots.  When we got to\
the ridge we headed left, on easy terrain for a while, then some\
scrambly bits.  Gradually, the scrambling got a little harder, and the\
snow-covered rocks were making me apprehensive.  The slippery rocks, the\
weather, the time, and the fact that we were both totally soaked from\
the shwackery combined and I started questioning the wisdom of\
continuing.  About that time, Mike, who was about 15 yards ahead of me\
hollered back, \""This is starting to look kind of like fuck this.\""  He\
came back to where I was and told me, \""If you go up there you can see\
that we can't see the rest of the ridge or the summit, since we're in\
a whiteout.\""  \""I already know we're in a whiteout, so why would I go\
up there just to see that there's nothing to see that I can't already\
not see from here?\""  We turned around\
and tried to find a better way down than what we'd come up, but got\
cliffed out, so we just reversed our ascent.\
\
Finished the day up with a couple of consolation beers in Startup,\
where we caught some flack for being \""lowlanders,\"" and having too many\
teeth.  When I looked into it the next day, it turned out we should\
have headed up almost directly from the car, and then gone a bit past\
the ridge, instead of staying right on the crest.  All in all, it was\
nice to get out in the woods, even if it was in kind of a miserable\
way."
"Malachite-peak","Malachite Peak: 2.19.05","Aaron, Margie and I enjoyed a rewarding, if unsuccessful attempt of Malachite Peak on Saturday. Leaving the car at 8:20, the trail was fairly easy up to Malachite Creek. After leaving the relative comfort of the hiker’s path, we did some “class 4 bushwhacking” (as Aaron put it) and eventually made our way to an open talus face, with clear views of the summit. Excitedly, we dumped our gear and gained the base of the summit at approximately 2:30. After a eliminating another option to the N, we decided that a small, class 3 gully running up the SW face was the only way to the summit. With energy and time running a bit short, we opted to descent after scrambling about forty feet of the final push. The spectacular views quickly buoyed our spirits as we glissaded back to the forest for the three-hour walk down to civilization. \

"Mount-rainier","Cheating death on Rainier:  a brief guide","Following some empirical research on the volcano this weekend, I have compiled a short instruction manual on how to avoid calamity.  By following these steps, you, too, can have a humbling experience.\
\
1.  Make a Rainier attempt in winter.  Pick a route that has reasonably low objective hazard, [i:2w35goul]at least according to the guidebook.[/i:2w35goul]  Something like the Fuhrer Finger as a carryover.\
\
2.  On the approach:  while climbing the snow gully after crossing the Nisqually Glacier, exit to the left early instead of staying in the gully.  Two minutes later a basketball-sized rock will come hurtling down the gully, and you will be glad you didn't stick around to catch it.\
\
3.  Fall into a crevasse, only not all the way.  Punching a leg through and flopping onto the snowbridge may not be elegant, but it beats going in all the way.\
\
4.  Catch your partner as he does the same thing later on.\
\
5.  Around 11,000 feet, after exiting the Finger, watch in awe as a serac calves off on the Nisqually Icefall.  \""Hey, check out the icefall over there.\""  Then dive onto your axe and think small as you realize that a fridge-sized chunk of serac is bouncing straight towards you at alarming speed.  Watch in disbelief as the fridge explodes into chunks 100 feet above you, two of which hit you and your partner simultaneously.  Check helmet, partner, and self for damage.  Dash for the cover of rock cliffs.\
\
6.  Bail without hesitation at 12,000 feet when you realize that the front which was supposed to move in late Sunday has decided to show up early.  It is much easier to downclimb the first 500 feet of the crux when all you have to contend with is a whiteout.  Thirty minutes later, when the lenticular whips with a vengeace, you will be happy that you are not on the upper mountain.\
\
7.  Retreat in haste to the parking lot.  Drink beer and eat chips.  Wonder how long it will take your toenails to fall off this time."
"index","Index","Jesse, Ben, and Baldwin were going to drive from Seattle in Jesse's car and pick me up in Redmond at my parents' house at 9:30a on the way to Index.  However, by the time they got to my parents' house at almost 10 they were in Baldwin's two seater truck with his two dogs in back.  So Jesse, Ben, and Baldwin crammed in front and I, being the largest, spread out in the covered truck bed with the dogs, even though I was the only one who knew directions to get to Monroe and thus US2 and Index from my parents' place way out in the boonies of suburbia.  \
\
So utter madness ensued as I wrote out directions on a piece of paper and pressed it against the rear window of the cab for Ben and Jesse to read and pass onto the driver.  The shortcut that actually makes going way east before turning north to Monroe worthwhile was closed for construction, crap.  So I made up some new directions on the fly and we drove all the way to Fall City before catching SR 203 north to Monroe.  A bouncy hour later we were in the parking lot and it was hot, sunny, and crowded.  Every 5.9 on the lower town wall was occupied so we walked up to the shaded inner wall, where there were yet more people.  \
\
Jesse belayed me on toxic Shock while Ben and Baldwin made quick work of that 5.7 fist crack across the way.  I fell about two feet twice in a row on the lie back on a TCU I borrowed from Baldwin.  Bad form, so I stuck in my own TCU a couple inches above it and finally sent the pitch.   I've never fallen there before, and with five people watching a bit embarrasing.  Oh well, the rest of the pitch went easily.  \
\
My ridiculous pro spacing can be seen here, on a picture pilfered from Ben's site,\
\
[img:11atujcu]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/benlong/pictures/IndexTownWall/DSCN0074&#46;JPG[/img:11atujcu]\
\
Ben and Baldwin then went and climbed Princely Ambitions, Roger's Corner and Breakfast of Champions.  Jesse and I climbed the GM route to stay out of the sun and then did Roger's Corner to meet up with Ben and Baldwin, who we shared a rappel with. This is actually more complicated in practice than in theory, as can be seen in this photo, also from Ben's site\
\
[img:11atujcu]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/benlong/pictures/IndexTownWall/DSCN0089&#46;JPG[/img:11atujcu]\
\
Baldwin had a cam of his dropped off of Breakfast, but it was getting kinda old, and now he gets a new one.  Baldwin then led Saggitarious, but ran out of big gear so had to stop at the first anchors.  I followed, got pumped, and took a short pendulum onto a 4 camalot in the middle of the undercling.  I climbed back up to it and found it was stuck, must have wedged super tight when I fell on it.  I worked on it for several minutes and only managed to rotate it a little.  Baldwin went back up to work on it and gave up on account of darkness, and the fact that it wasn't coming out.  So Baldwin gets two new cams; cragging is way too expensive for me, I'm going back to the mountains. \
\
Speaking of which, Ben has some great shots of Index, Persis, and the rest of the Skykomish peaks here,\

"Mount-shuksan","The Shukster","John Mauro and I went up to try a one-day climb/ski of the Sulphide Glacier route on Shuksan. I'm fighting a cold, but figured I could probably pull it off. \
In a nutshell, we made it, but it sure was a haul, and somewhat hairy as well.  \
\
We drove up Saturday afternoon, had a leisurely dinner at the trailhead, and were on our way at 5:20 am on Sunday. We made it to the glacier in just over 3 hours, and were making great time and feeling good. Weather was beautiful at first - sun with some little clouds - but then became mostly overcast. We had lunch just below the summit pyramid at about 11:00, and then headed up the gulley around noon. We had a couple of pickets and one screw with us, along with axes and crampons. The gully was slow going in the odd, dry-winter conditions. The route was alpine ice covered by 6-10 inches of windslab snow (except where it had sloughed off), 45-50 degrees pretty much the whole way with nasty rocks at the bottom. Well, we were moving slow, simulclimbing, kicking steps and planting our axes firmly before making each move. I placed the one screw we had too early, thinking there was more snow up ahead, when in fact there was only more ice. We did manage to get in a slightly marginal picket placed as a deadman, offering some pro at one point, which was quickly passed. Near the top, the gully exit is a few short steps of 60 degree mixed stuff - water ice and rock - which I managed to stem my way through. At the top, I got my axe it to belay John up the final bit. We suddenly found ourselves at the top. It was now raining and about 3:30 as we contemplated our options. We managed to excavate a not-too-sketchy rock to rappel off to avoid the mixed exit, but then had to downclimb the rest of it, slowly and painstakingly. Cramponing in tele boots is very unnerving on real ice I must say. Anyway, while it was agonizing, we made it down nice and slow without any disasters. So there we were at the top of the sulphide glacier, in a rainy whiteout, at 5:30 pm, soaked, dehydrated and almost out of water, contemplating descending about 6000 feet in the one remaining hour of daylight. \
\
Well, shit we did it - what else were we going to do? The ski down was supposed to be the highlight of the trip, but it kind of sucked. The snow had turned to mush and was heavy and scary, with new slides in some places. We couldn't see anything, but managed to follow our up tracks down, doing some heavy survival skiing. We made it back to the trees in the last bits of light and tromped down the trail by headlamp. Well, 15 hours car-to-car - we didn't break any records but got up and down safely. If we had brought an extra tool and 4 more ice screws, oh and maybe weren't climbing in tele boots, the top probably would have been really fun. As it is, we probably made the wrong call and should have just blown off the summit and skied down while the snow was good. Oh well, \""experience comes from bad judgement\"". I'm sore as all hell today, and I don't think my cold is any better. Ugh. In any case, many thanks to John for being such a good sport about it all, carrying the rope, and sharing his water so selflessly."
"Vesper-peak","Vesper Peak 3.6.05","Planning to climb Whitehorse Peak via Whitehorse Glacier/Snow Gulch, Aaron, Margie and I woke early Sunday morning. After arriving at the Burke museum at 4 am, a phone call from Aaron dashed our Whitehorse plans. Jesse, who was supposed to be the fourth member of our rope team, wimped out. Two hours later, sunrise found us a few hundred yards up the Sunrise Mine Trail. The first section of the trail went smoothly until we climbed up to Headlee Pass. I started out as lead step-kicker, but after an hour or so, I’d had enough of the thigh-deep post holing. Margie took over for about half an hour. By the time she quit we were only about one third of the way up what later turned out to be the wrong gully (and the crux of the trip). Aaron single-handedly kicked steps up the remaining two thirds of the gully. From the top, we saw boot tracks a few feet down slope and a trail leading from the correct gully. Once on the trail, it was pretty much a straight shot all the way to the top. We thought about climbing Vesper and Sperry, but the route on Sperry looked a little hairy and no one felt particularly motivated. On the descent: Aaron purposefully set off a few small avalanches – absolutely amazing; Margie busted her head with her ice axe on the scree field; and, since I was last in line, I made a screaming glissade of the “correct” gully below Headlee Pass. Great trip out, especially considering how close we were to ending up on Whitehorse with all those helicopters and mountain rescue people. \

,"Gothic Basin - 13 March 2005","Sunday morning Lissa, Stephanie, Brad and I met at Barlow Pass and headed up the Weden Creek Trail to Gothic Basin.  The trail was bare until past the three \""snow gullies\"" and then consolidated snow up to the basin.  We veered off the trail early, taking the shorter approach to Del Campo and enjoyed a sporty rock and moss scramble on route to Foggy Lake.  From Gothic Basin the views of Sloan, Columbia, Pugh and Eldorado were spectacular.  After a lazy, sun bathing lunch above the lake, we opted to scramble to the top of what we deemed \""Dragon's Peak\"" - a snow covered knob east of Del Campo.  On the way down we did some fast and furious free-style sledding to the trail.  Heading back along the Monte Cristo road we entertained ourselves with some tree root bouldering and a 100-meter dash to the Barlow Pass gate.  Fresh banana bread and a few beers awaited us at the trail head.  Good times had by all.\
Will get back there again soon to bag Gothic Peak and Del Campo (Ben Long, hint, hint)."

Climb: Kangaroo Temple-NW Face \
\
Date of Climb: 3/12/2005 \
\
Trip Report: \
Eric Gratz and I climbed the NW Face route on Kangaroo Temple on Saturday (3/12/2005). Originally, Eric just wanted to go to Index or something because he had to study for finals, but all I had to say was \""Washington Pass\"". We left Friday night. Things looked sketchy right away, as Eric wasn't diggin' the Zappa on the stereo, fell asleep, and started to snore. It rained. I worried about the rain. I worried about having climbed nothing but Coach's Crack in months. We laid out sleeping bags in the back of the Subaru and Eric conducted his snore orchestra, heavy on the bass and oboe parts.\
\
For breakfast, Eric shared his magical long-lasting burritos. Their effects lasted well into the approach, their taste returning now and then. We sidehilled ridiculously in our snowshoes through the trees after Kangaroo Pass. The mountain looked cold.\
\
We wandered to and fro near the base of the route, looking for the best start, finally settling in to belay at a tree partway straight up the first pitch of the summer route. Eric led in crampons with much scraping on the traversing, slabby bits, then was rewarded with some thin ice and mixed climbing to a tree. This first pitch had a little of everything: drytooling on slabby granite, moss/dirt, sticky ice, verglas. Really fun.\
\
\
\
Verglas was treacherous, collecting in the positive dimples on the slabs. Eric took a nice leader fall on pitch three, right as he was reaching for a piece of gear. I reeled in several armfuls before he scraped to a stop, upside down and saying \""eff\"" in his inimitable way. I cheese-gratered off at nearly the same spot while following, swinging to a stop directly over a big smear of ice. We were in rock shoes at this point, which is really the best way to play \""find-the-verglas\"".\

"Mount-garfield","Infinite Bliss, lower half","I couldn't convince Jason K to get up earlier than 8-ish on sunday so we took a trip up the middle fork snoqualmie rd to the south face of Garfield.  Not feeling any pressure to even try to reach the summit, we got to the base of the route sometime after 10 and simuled the first four pitches or so.  Pitched everything out after that and eventually caught up with a pair ahead of us.  We took a long break below the pitch they were on, soaking up the sun, and decided it would be a good time to rappel down.  I think we bailed after pitch 11, a 5.10a pitch.  A beautiful leisurely day; good times.  \

,"Chainsaw Wall at Exit 38","Here is a super boring trip report with no pictures about what I did on Sunday.\
\
I was supposed to climb with Josh Whorely but he got sick and couldn't go, so since I had read in the guidebook that you could set top ropes on the climbs at Chainsaw Wall at exit 38, I decided to hike up there and use an ascender to rope solo some of the routes.  The hike up was long and steep, it took about 40 minutes, but on the top I was rewarded by a cliff bathing in the sun (unlike almost all the other crags at Exit 38 which are buried in the jungle).  I started on the 5.8 at the far right (maybe called Texas Chainsaw Cheerleaders), which takes honours as the absolute worst sport route of that grade that I have ever done.  Awkward, blocky, fighting through a tree to start it, do yourself a favour and never try this route.  I then moved on to the 10 to the left (called Chainsaw Chalupa) which wasn't as bad as the 5.8, but pretty close.  Also awkward, weird climbing in a corner, not very fun.  I then moved on to Stihl Fingers, the 5.12a seam that graces the cover of the old exit 38 guide book, and it is awesome!  I did a few runs on it, and I am excited to go back and lead it, it is really really good.  Super clean face with sharp edges in the seam, interesting footwork and some big moves (the way I did it, anyways) between some of the better features in the seam.  It is also steeper than I was expecting.  Next I tried the 5.11c to the left of that, called My Evil Plan, this route was also good, but not as good as Stihl Fingers.  Worth doing, though.  There was another party who did the 5.10c at the far left, and apparently it is good too, although I never tried it.  So there you have it, everything you ever needed to know about what you should/should not climb at Chainsaw Wall."
"Mount-rainier","Skiing on Rainier","Andy, Rok and i left town early on Sunday to head up to Mt Rainier for some skiing/riding. The weather was impeccable though the wind got pretty strong up on the Muir snowfield. The two snowboarders had a particularly hard time of it since their boards, strapped to their packs, extended far above their heads and caught the wind rather nicely. Although the tele skis were better for wind resistance (partly because they were on my feet and not on my back), i spent my fair share of the time on my ass.  The gusts also peppered us with ice pellets, which brought back memories of getting sandblasted in Patagonia.  The snow up on the snowfield did not corn up due to the strong wind but the descent was still a blast, and we avoided hitting any rocks/trees exposed due to the freakishly low snow levels."
"Crystal-mountain-wa","Crystal Mountain","This weekend I was at Crystal Mountain getting avalanche training so that I can help teach avalanche awareness for the Mountaineers in future years.  The instructors were the head ski patrollers at Crystal.  They were great, and I learned a lot.  But the coolest thing was watching the avalanche dogs at work.  We had a mock rescue scenario with multiple buried victims.  Tandem to our scenario, the ski patrollers had their own scenario.  The dogs ran around on the snow, homed in to the scent, and started digging.  Within a few minutes, a guy bundled up with multiple jackets and a radio crawled out.  We had no idea that he had been down there the entire time we were doing our scenario!  But that's how they train the dogs (and sometimes that means sending the guy to be buried with some oxygen)..  Those dogs were SO SO SO COOL!\

"Frisco-mountain","Rainy Lake/Frisco Mt","What? Skiing again? \
Saturday, Phil, Matt and I bombed up to Rainy pass, skied straight (SW) above Rainy lake and made beautiful turns in epic pow-pow on the NE face of Frisco. That's right, folks, it's winter up there again. Some visibility issues arose due to the constant dumpage through the day, but it shore was nice feeling the rhythm of real skiing again. Bounce, bounce, bounce, face shots, face shots, face shots.\
The highway's open and it's winter again. How often does that happen?\
A good (nay, great!) time was had by all."
"Mount-stuart","Mt. Stuart - Ice Cliff Glacier","I got a hold of cfire from cascade climbers and we decided to head east to get the best of the weather thursday and friday.  Ben Long called me looking to get away from the exciting farm life out in Omak and he said he was up to some ice climbing so he met us at the trailhead thursday morning.  We were able to push through light, soft snow to the end of the road, awesome, where I convinced Ben he could squeeze all of his stuff into a day-sized bag.  The hike in went smoothly, used snowshoes from near the stuart lake-colchuck lake cutoff on up Mountaineer Creek to the basin below the north side of Stuart.  Barring a lot of new snow, snowshoes won't be necessary to get up there anymore.  \
\
We set up the Bibler cfire and I would sleep in on a flat spot of snow next to a cave formed by the jumbled boulders which had a suitable area for Ben's bivy sack.  Ben went to set up his sleeping place, but dropped the bivy sack, which rolled into a deep crevice among the rocks out of sight.  We looked for it, but couldn't even see it, let alone reach it.  cfire is a fireman and about 6'-2'' 205, and I'm 6' 195, there was no way we could fit all three of us into the Bibler.  cfire and I were shoulder to wall as it was.  I gave Ben my sleeping bag, at 10 F the warmest among us, and he set up as comfortably as he could using space blankets, plastic bags, his pack, and the rope in the cave.  I told Ben to come in the tent and I guess sleep on top of us if he ever got too cold, but he braved the night and was ready to go in the morning, despite not sleeping.  \
\
Tromped through unconsolidated, exhausting snow up over the moraine and up the left lobe of the ice cliff as the skies started to clear for the climb.  We stuck to the exposed ice as much as possible, but spent the majority of our time swimming uphill, leaving a trench instead of steps behind us.  I was right out of shape and let Chris and Ben break the majority of the trail.  We roped up and simuled a long pitch on the ice cliff proper, alternating between steep front-pointing and wallowing until I became too tired to blaze anymore, and we traded leads.  Simuled another long pitch up over the ice cliff and rested on the walls of the ice cliff arete.  A lot more wallowing and a couple crevasse crossings brought us across the glacier ending in a hero lead of brekaing trail by Ben to the base of the couloir.  \
\
There was a pitch of WI 2+ getting into the couloir which we simuled, but that soon gave way to more unconsolidated snow.  I expected cfire to switch leads at any time as he traversed the couloir back and forth looking for easier going, but he just kept kicking, taking us all the way up.  We emerged just under the cloud layer and after all that loose snow we decided to descend.  Had to make one rappel in order to stay high on the east ridge on our way down to the Sherpa Glacier.   We came to the top of the Sherpa Glacier couloir which had an impressive cornice and in the low snow conditions looked to be about 60 degrees.  So we rappelled into the couloir off a big rock horn out of the way of the cornice.  A short section of face-in down climbing in an icy section in the middle of the couloir brought us down to the glacier where we made our way around some seracs and down.  \
\
The walk out saw me back to the trailhead last where Ben had already left and cfire was waiting.  Channeling Eric's energy cfire almost immediately got his subaru high-centered following the now-hardened ruts in the snow.  We spent the next hour digging it out, basically excavating all the snow under and around the car before we were able to rock it out.  A few more close calls with snow on the axle and we finally got below snow-line.  good times."
,"Dan and Ralph Train Hard","Since winter is finally here, Dan and I decided to start training for the winter alpine season.  We know some guys who do weather with computers and they think this upcoming winter might be a good one.  So we drove up to Snoqualmie Pass with snowshoes to do some training in the harshest of subalpine environments.\
\
Dan was effing pumped and ate a whole chicken on the drive up.  It was raining when we started up the Denny Creek trail, so we put on our expensive laminated garments in order to keep the wetness from escaping.  Rain turned to miles and miles of snow soon after we crossed under the North Pillars of I-90 (some sick lines there, brother).  Three parties passed us on their way out, looking haggard and obviously having given up in the face of the snow slog that lay ahead.  I don't remember anything but snow and trees, but I'm pretty sure there were bushes, too.  We made it to Melakwa Lake in two hours, fully soaked.\
\
We expected to encounter the Indian spirits of Tuscohatchie Lake, but all was quiet... Until Dan, clearly hypothermic, started doing a happy dance and singing \""Climb, Climb Sunshine Mountain\"".  The conditions were not shitty enough or the training not hard enough; either way, I had to get Dan back down to lower elevations before he started really enjoying himself.  Luckily, the freezing level had risen and soon we were back in the rain, slush up to our ankles.  The snowshoes never left our packs, so I'm planning to bring heavier ones next time for even harder training.\
\
We didn't see any cars on I-90 for five miles on the drive home.  Fantasies played through my head of Seattle being nuked by Eastern Washington separatists, but the highway was just temporarily closed.\
\
With a few more weekends like this, Snoqualmie Pass ski area might make its earliest opening ever.  The very thought of rainy Saturdays and 5000' freezing levels makes me do a happy dance.  Keep training hard, UWCCers!  Winter is on its way!"
"Mount-hardy","Mt. Hardy - Open Fly Couloir","Phil and I went back to Mt. Hardy this year to check out a couloir he had noticed on [url=http&#58;//alpinedave&#46;com/mt_hardy/ne_couloir/ne_couloir&#46;htm:ht1uhk4z]our last ski out there.[/url:ht1uhk4z] A narrower, and slightly longer slot that we couldn't tell if it just benched out into a cliff or continued down to the valley. Phil went up to check it out a couple weeks ago during the sun, and brought back enticing enough pictures for me to sign up!\
\
The couloir was great: steep and narrow the whole way! The slope probably maxed out around 50 degrees for a few hundred feet, but bulk of the skiing was about 40 degrees on nice compacted powder. Things were very stable then (friday the 25th), and we were able to w00p it up pretty good. I could do this ski every year!\

"snow-creek-wall","Outerspace","Josh Whorley and I decided to do the uber-Washington classic, since he hadn't done it yet and i'm finally working up my trad-lead courage.  we got to the base of the wall in time to see eric finish pitch 1 and talk with scott.  \
we decided to do a 5.7 dihedral start with a 4th class traverse over the direct 5.8 that scott indicated to us.  i had convinced josh to let me do the 5.9 pitch, so i took off on the first.  I didn't find much gear, but it felt like 4th class-5.6,so i wasn't real concerned.  when i pulled what felt like a 5.7 mantle on slopers to the belay, i realized that I was 1 bluge above the bolted anchor.  so time to downclimb-btw downclimbing mantles suck. I got to a ledge at the base of what i thought was the corect ramp up and sad to josh \""alrighty! im at the right place now.   annnnnnnd, im off!\""  I had forgotten that we were climbing and word like \""off\"" have a special meaning.  so a few seconds later, i hear josh yell \""alright jeremy, youre off belay!\"" ummmm, i meant im off as in \""im off on the crux of the climb\""  so after a few chuckles (after all i was on a ledge) i set off on the \""5.7\"".  i think i was off route cuz it felt like 10- labacks.  \
josh came up and wuickly took off on the 4th class pitch, then when the rope went taught, i began to simul.  now at the base of the 5.9 pitch, i took a couple deep breaths.  I slowly made it up the pitch, stitching it up like nobody's business and occaisionally clearing the sand out of my vagina.  finally making it to the ledge, i began to look for a place fo my anchor.  for some reason the tree didnt look especially good, so i started playing around with the little gear i had left.  after at least 15-25 minutes (wayyyy toooo looong) I finally got josh on and brought him up.\
we finished up the climb without any issues, but for the climb described as \""the best handcrack in washington\"

"Sunshine-wall","Vantage Air Guitar Area","Lindsay, Lissa and I went to Vantage on Saturday a week ago.  I am officially not climbing off the couch any more (I had not placed any rock pro since August, though I placed a picket in some rock in Sept).  I was wondering how stupid it would be to, ummm, jump on the NR of Stuart and lead the Gendarme off the couch.  \
\
The Air Guitar area is nice -- about 8 routes withiin 30 feet of each other, all 5.8-5.10a.  If you know our trip reports well enough by now, you would be correct in that we had the usual assortment of tasty goodies.\

"Sunshine-wall","Frenchman Coulee","Jason Killgore and I went to the seemingly only place it wasn't raining in washington saturday.   Climbed Air Guitar, Pony Keg, Crossing the Threshold, and then due to an ironic snafu with jason's blue rope, we both led Tangled up in Blue.  Also climbed some cool sport climbs on the lower cliffs including Jigsaw Direct, Y2K Crash, and Heel Higher Crescent.  All the routes were solid and good times; the number of three and four star routes over there impresses me, despite how similar they tend to be to each other.  Should be plenty new ones to choose from for the next rainy day."
"index","Index upper town wall action.","Baldwin and I went to index.  We started out climbing Davis/Holland Lovin Arms.  At the top of David Holland we watch some dude base jumb right pasted us, it was crazy.  The route was as excepted awesome, you should do it.\
\
Then we went and climbed lamplighter and the first full pitch of heavens gate.  They were both kinda hard.  Lamplighter was hard but to hard it wasn't fun.  The first full pitch of heavensgate was really hard and perhaps hard enought that it wasn't any fun.  Feel good reading Mike's report and noticing that that pitch was 5.11a not 5.10b/c like i thought it was. Will have to go try that route again when I'm mentally more in it.\
\
Finished the day with the zipper which was also quite fun and worth doing.  That is all, Thanks Baldwin."
,"Tank Lakes/Pt 6100+ - 4/24/05","Boyd and I headed up to the Alpine Lakes on Sunday with the intention (succesful!) of making an early season trip up Necklace Valley to the Tank Lakes.  I'd heard that the area was pretty nice and the countour lines seemed pretty far apart on the map, so seemed like it would make a good trip.  And wow.  Easily my best day out in a year, maybe the best out in two.\
\
After an obligatory stop at the Sultan Bakery (blueberry scones are so good) we reached the trailhead and started hiking around 9 am.  Foss River Road has been regravelled at the start, which cuts down on the fishtailing in the mud that I encountered last time I was out there.  The first 4+ miles of the trail are basically rolling/flat, paralleling the river.  We heard an amazing number of frogs from the marshes, but decided not to investigate.\
\
After crossing the river (my legs hurt too much to go downstairs and get the map to look up the name), the trail ascends rapidly up to the Necklace Valley through forest and open slopes.  Spectacular views to the east of near vertical rock faces.  Past mile 6, the snow starts and the trail condition degrades.  Lots of water on the trail above this point.  Slippery old puncheon, mossy rocks, and mud.  All covered by a thin layer of concealing snow.  Gotta love early season hiking.\
\
Reached Jade Lake around 11:30.  The lake's starting to melt out around the edges, but is still completely snow covered.  Crossed a very sketchy snowbridge at the southern inlet and quickly climbed towards Emerald Lake.  Here we broke off from the trail and contoured up gentle slopes, aiming for the low gradient approach to Tank Lakes.  Amazing views of La Bohn gap to the south.\
\
A little before 3 we crested the ridge looking down on the Tank Lakes (totally snow covered) and just couldn't stop grinning.  360 degree panorama of snow capped peaks and ice covered lakes.  A quick class 2 scramble brought us to a local peak above the lakes and we hung out for a while, soaking in the views (and the sun).  Glacier, Iron Gap, Azurite Lake, and Angeline Lake all visible. \
\
Dropped down from the summit around 3:20 and made short work of the glissade.  Back to the car (and pretty tired) around 7:00.  ~17 miles, 4500 ft gain."
"Kaleetan-peak","Kaleetan Peak","My dad, Ted, Margie, and I fought our way up deep slush to point 5700 on the south ridge of Kaleetan on Saturday. We turned back short of the summit as the weather turned sour, but had good views and good times.  \

"del-campo-peak","Del Campo Peak 4.30.05","In spite of a rather discouraging forecast, Margie and I decided to head up to Gothic Basin on saturday. Luckily, the only rain we encountered fell on the brief bike ride to the Weden Creek trailhead. Leaving at 8:20, we hiked up to Gothic Basin. Margie set a blistering pace, and we reached the ridge above Foggy Lake around 11:00. The snow was firm, and we made good time up the snowfield. We then scrambled up surprisingly dry rock just left of the notch without a problem. The sketchiest part of the climb was the \""snow gully” just below the summit pyramid. It had fractured repeatedly and looked as though it were about to slide off the mountain. However, we persevered and arrived at the summit at 12:30. The skies were dramatic; so on the way down we snapped loads of pictures. It was a fantastic day out. Like so many before me, I highly recommend this scramble. \

"Colchuck-peak","Colchuck NBC","After last year's glamorous failure before reaching the base of the route ([url:3f1kwphl]http&#58;//danielarndt&#46;com/photos/album/2004-0410-colchuck&#46;php[/url:3f1kwphl]), I was looking forward to having another go at the climb.  Griff and I met Saturday morning and drove to the Stuart Lake trailhead and set out for Colchuck Lake.  There was some snow on the trail, but it did not become continuous until just before reaching the lake (after last year we stayed well away from the lake).  We decided to camp up on the moraine to be as close as possible to the route.  The trek up the boulder field was unpleasant due to all the postholing but we made it.  Under cloudy skies we setup camp and made dinner.  Griff went for a short ski run before we turned in for the night.\
\
I woke in the middle of the night and stepped outside to see an amazing display of stars.  In a matter of minutes I saw two shooting stars, so I took this to be a good omen for our climb.\
\
We woke up Sunday morning to firm snow so we headed up towards the couloir.  We climbed unroped with two axes until we reached a rock step.  There we roped up and I lead the short 4th class rock.  From there we continued with a running belay occasionally placing rock pro or a deadman.  Our going was slow since we were kicking new steps, but the clouds cooperated by hiding the sun while we were in the couloir.  We reached the top, where we rested and ate.  Griff lead up most of the snow face and through the gulley below the summit block, placing running pro again as we went.  A short 4th class rock step put us on the summit.  By this time the clouds were high and we were treated to amazing views of Stuart, Daniel, and more of the Eastern Cascades.  After a short trip down to Colchuck Col, Griff put on skies and I glissaded back down to camp.  We quickly packed up and started the descent back to the trailhead.  \
\
This climb was a lot of fun and very rewarding.  The views are spectacular and the route was a mix of mountaineering skills, which I really enjoyed.  I highly recommend it.\

"Mount-pugh","Not quite Mt. Pugh 5.7.05","Margie and I had intended to climb Mount Pugh until about 7:30 on friday night. Margie needed to buy some new shell pants, so while she shopped, I flipped through a guidebook until I arrived at the section for Mount Daniel. Since no one on the UW climbing board had expressed interest in going to Mount Pugh, we changed our plans and set our sights on Mount Daniel. \
\
We woke fairly early and got on the road by 6:15. About two hundred yards from the trailhead my sloppy driving got us stuck in a benign-looking patch of snow. We spent the next hour and a half digging/pushing the car out. Arriving at the trailhead at 10:15, we started walking by 10:30 – a late start for this trail during the spring thaw. We made decent time to Peggy’s Pond, arriving around 1:30. Mount Daniel loomed large from our lunch spot, and neither of us thought, as we later admitted to each other, that we were to summit that day. After lunch Margie cut steps up the steep NE face to gain the SE ridge, this section turned out to be the crux of the climb.  Once on the ridge (and out of the avy paths) things were fairly easy. The only interesting part came when we climbed over the ridge’s “small rock outcrop” with crampons on (we took them off on the way back). We then crossed the S slope of the East Summit, and nearly jogged up the Middle Summit – arriving just after 5:00. We spent ten minutes on top and then headed down, arriving back at the car by 10:00 – car to car 11.5 hours (6.5 ascending, 5 descending).  \

"Mount-baker","Mt. Baker good to go","We went up the Squock to Sherman Peak (sub-summit of Baker, 10,000' or so) on Thursday.  Baker is prime for ski touring now.  The Schreiber's Meadow trailhead is snow-free, and continuous snow begins a bit below treeline.  The snowpack is not totally consolidated so any foot-travel should be done before the sun hits it, but it's all good on skis.  Navigation was a joke with very few open crevasses.\

"Sunshine-wall","Vantage","After the weather forecast thwarted our plans, Baldwin and I decided to go cragging at Frenchman's Coulee.  We warmed up on that .10b next to Party in your Pants.  Then Air Guitar while we waited for acouple of guys to get off of George and Martha.  We climbed that then left the TR up so we could have a whack at Red M&Ms.  It was hard, but not as bad as people have made it sound.  I got all the moves, but definately had some hangs.  I then lead 7 Virgins and a Mule (a fun 5.7 chimny) and we finished off the day with a TR on the .10d next to it.  Overall a fun day (although HOT!).  We ran into Matt Peterson (a worker drone from the IMA gym) and Zman.  Looked like all were enjoying themselves.\
Finished the whole thing off with some Coronas at that little park on the water in Vantage and Mos Def on the stereo."
"Columbia-peak","Columbia Peak 5/14/05","Short Version:\
\
Lindsay, Carla, and I climbed Columbia Peak on Saturday.  This one's been on my tick list for a long time.  10 miles round trip (+8 miles on bike), 4700 ft elevation gain.  The river crossing on the Monte Cristo road is running high - but there is a very nice new footbridge across.  From Barlow Pass, bike in to Monte Cristo and follow signs through the townsite for the Silver Lake trail. \
\
Saw bear tracks, several inquisitive pikas, a pissed off grouse, and a fleeting glimpse on the flanks of Columbia of what we think might have been a cougar (dark, catlike, long tail).\
\
Thanks to Lindsay for all the awesome food - cookies, fruit, and the like.\
\
Don't believe the hype about the rain.  We had awesome summiting conditions.  Brought snowshoes and crampons, though neither was useful or necessary.\
\
Pictures forthcoming.\
\
Long-winded Version:\
\
On Saturday, Carla, Lindsay, and I headed up to Monte Cristo to have a go at Columbia Peak.  The trip didn't' start out so well.  We departed Barlow Pass in light rain and arrived at fog-shrouded Monte Cristo one stream crossing and detached tire later.  Considering the less than stellar conditions and a route description that warned of loose rock, a slabby gully, and high exposure, I figured the trip would be little more than recon.\
\
Leaving Monte Cristo, we ascended easily to Silver Lake, encountering solid snow starting at Poodle Dog Pass.  The trail to Silver Lake is in very good condition, with only some minor debris from the winter storms.  After a snack at Silver Lake, we consulted the map and realized we had missed the turn for the trail to Twin Lakes.  So, we headed back up to Poodle Dog, hoping to find something that looked like a spur trail.  Of course, when the spur trail's under a few feet of snow, it's not exactly obvious.  By dumb luck, we actually ended up on the summer route, though passed the knob above Poodle Dog on the wrong side.  On the back side, the snow thinned again and we found enough bare trail to convince ourselves we were on the correct route. \
\
Even in drifting clouds and fog, the ridge walk to Twin Lakes is very pleasant, though a little brushy in places.  Above '76 Gulch the clouds thinned enough for us to see the saddle above Twin Lakes and begin considering routes up Columbia.  We ate lunch on some snow-free rocks below the Twin Lakes saddle and decided that we should head up towards Columbia and see how far we could get before the route degraded too badly. \
\
From the Twin Lakes saddle, the route climbs a wide snow-covered heather ramp, passes through a clump of rocks and emerges in a really nice high alpine meadow.  Very cool walk with Columbia drifting in and out of the clouds with occasional views of Twin Lakes and '76 Gulch.  At the end of the meadows, we ascended gravel and sand slopes to the bottom of a cliff band and traversed to the right on sound rock.  From there we climbed easy snow and rock to what the route description refers to as \""a craggy dark rock buttress\"" which is currently spouting a single cluster of brilliant purple flowers about twenty feet up.\
\
The clouds had moved back in, really cutting down on visibility as we headed to the left of the buttress on steep snow.  The route description said to climb moderately steep snow into a snow/scree basin rising to a headwall.  With the clouds rolling around us, visibility was terrible and as kicked steps up, I started wondering if we should turn back.  I couldn't tell if I was still climbing the steep snow part or was in the basin.  Which was a little disconcerting.  However, shortly after these doubts surfaced, a strong wind blew away the clouds, revealing that were indeed on route in the basin and only a few hundred feet below the headwall.  Cool.\
\
At the top of the basin, we traversed right onto sound, dry rock, rounding the headwall.  From here, the route heads up a \""gully\"" though it seems to me to be more of a broad basin.  (But I didn't write the excellent route description, so it's really not in my place to nitpick.)  We pulled ourselves into the \""gully\"" up a short rock step and ascended really nasty choss for a few hundred feet to a \""right angling blocky gully\"" that led us up to steep, snow covered slope angling straight to the summit block.  Though steep, the snow was excellent for kick stepping and the summit block drew progressively closer.  We opted for a direct ascent from the snow field which I *strongly* discourage.  Transitioning from the upper snow field to summit block involves a single very nasty exposed 3rd class (low 4th?) move.\
\
Upon reaching the summit (as if on cue) the clouds started breaking up.  First breaks were over Twin Lakes and back towards Monte Cristo.  Then we had some good views to the south.  Then decent views of Del Campo and Gothic.  Then, finally, the clouds pushed out of the Blanca basin giving us views of Monte Cristo Peak, Kyes, and the Columbia Glacier.  We had 360 degree views, just not all at once.  tongue.gif  Which is just as well, the summit of Columbia is not a good place to get dizzy.\
\
After signing the summit register (first signed summit of the season!), we headed back down - this time opting for an exposed but solid snow decent down the north side of the summit block to the ledge described in the summer route.  We ended up backing down the entire upper snow gully which took *forever*, but were back at the base of the \""gulley\"" around 5:30.  From there we cruised/glissaded back to Twin Lakes saddle and moved pretty fast back to Monte Cristo, reaching the townsite right around 8 pm.  On the bikes and back to Barlow before dark.  In retrospect, our summit turn-around time of 3:49 pm was spot on. \
\
A few comments on the route:\
- The morning/afternoon clouds kept the snow from getting too goopy.  On a sunny day the snow basin past the \""craggy, dark rock buttress\"" would be prime for a slide\
- In another week or two, the snow around the back of the summit block will probably be too shallow to kick step, but still thick enough to add unpleasant slickness"
"Mount-stuart","Cascadian Couloir 5.21.05","Jesse and I climbed Mt. Stuart this weekend:\
\
We began the approach wet. The rain ended about 700’ below Long’s Pass where it started snowing. After we dropped over the pass, however, the conditions improved dramatically. Not only did we find a nice campsite in the meadow below the Cascadian Couloir, but the precipitation let up and we got to see Mt. Stuart for a few brief moments. We awoke at 5am to clear, cold skies and a slightly whiter Stuart. \
\
The snow in the Couloir was shallow but solid from about 7000’ onwards and we made good time. After strapping on our crampons just below the false summit, we ascended the penultimate headwall and gained the summit ridge. Wind scoured snow provided excellent footing on the ridge and the breeze made it seem nice and alpiney. Jesse and I arrived at the summit at 10:35 and though Rainier and Adams had loomed over us for much of the ascent, clouds had since moved in and hid them from view. The remainder of the Cascades made up for the southern volcanoes, however. We took some imaginary pictures with our imaginary cameras (including some portraits on the summit as photographic proof of our ascent) and then headed down. \
\
By the time we got back on Long’s Pass Trail, Stuart had gone the way of Rainier and Adams and the rain had started back up again. Returned to the car at 3:45 fairly tired, a little wet, and very happy about our luck with the weather. Overall, Stuart’s pretty characteristic of the snow conditions right now – nothing down low and not very much high up. The upper mountain was tons of fun. I can’t wait to go back."
"leavenworth-area-climbs","Leavenworth Bouldering_2","Leon and I headed back to Leavenworth this Sunday. The weather was perfect: sunny, cool, and dry. We headed over to the Pasture past the Star Wars boulders in the morning and did some fun problems. A high, committing V3 named BSE and tried a hard sit-start V3 (the barn door) that felt sandbagged. The granite in the pasture is very rough and just ate trough my tips. As the day warmed up we headed into the forest to the Beach to do an amazing V2 called the fin. It starts under a fin and moves up over a large sail to a nice top out. We cleaned some holds off a dirty, mossy unnamed problem. We ended the day at the fridge boulder. Leon sent a nice V3 and we worked a very possible looking V5 dyno that we will save for another day. It was great day in Bavaria."
"Snowking-mountain","Cyclone Lake - 5/21/05","Jeremy, Aaron, and I attempted to climb Snowking on Saturday, but ended up turning back due to time a little before Cyclone Lake.  We had good weather for most of the day - though the clouds did roll in around the time we turned back.  Plentiful views of Buckindy, Eldorado, J-berg, Snowking (duh), and Mutchler.\
\
For anyone else interested in giving this a shot:\
\
The road is drivable by a passenger car with decent clearance (my integra pushed a few rocks out of the way) to ~2 miles in.  At this point there is a massive snag across the road and a huge washout about 15 ft beyond.  Might save a little time to bring bikes as far as the upper brushy part.  \
\
Well-established climber's trail starts at the very end of the logging road (do not take the uphill fork you pass early on).  Trail climbs steeply through timber until reaching open (snow covered) meadows.  Thanks to some very solid route finding by Aaron, we were able to stay on the path until after passing Pt. 5116.  From here, snow is nearly constant.  On the way up, we tried staying to the west of the ridge above Found Lake and ran into a massive field of boulder and slabs, the likes of which none of us had seen before.  While visually interesting, our pace slowed to a crawl through that stretch.  If heading up to Snowking in the next few weeks, stay on the east side of the ridge.  Near the top, the snow will clear, revealing a climber's trail marked by cairns.  \
\
On the way back down we participated in (what I understand) is a ritual for those climbing Snowking - losing the trail.  Though, honestly, the trail at the beginning is so steep that bushwhacking downhill isn't really that much different than walking downhill.  Good times!\
\
I have some pictures that I'll post in a day or so."
,"Asgaard Pass - 5/22/05","Headed in to Leavenworth area (first time!) on Sunday with the intention of climbing Dragontail.  Lousy weather and snow conditions (and auditory hallucinations for one member of the party) led to us turning around at the saddle above Asgaard.  \
\
There's been some recent snow up there.  Suprised to find knee deep powder starting low on the pass.  Wind was really going, too.  Felt more like winter than it has all year.   <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\"" alt=\"":shock:\"" title=\""Shocked\"" /><!-- s:shock: --> \
\
For those interested, the standard scramble route on Dragontail is currently sporting a number of rather nasty looking cornices.  It's possible that they only looked bad from our angle at Asgaard.\
\
Saw a couple of Ptarmigans shuffling around in the snow on the way up to Asgaard and a partially eaten boot hanging from a tree branch.  Mmm... leather...\
\
Colchuck Lake area is spectacular.  Definitely going to be heading back that way once more of the fresh snow has melted and consolidated."
,"UW Rock:  Another beautiful day in paradise","My trip to the rock today was so glorious that I thought it warranted a tr.  Nothing special really:  climb, bask in the sun, climb more.  The SUN!  Beatific, copacetic, etc.  I expect to look like a lobster tomorrow, but I'll worry about that when it comes up.  What a day.  Sweet.  <!-- s:D --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\"" alt=\"":D\"" title=\""Very Happy\"" /><!-- s:D -->"
"Colchuck-peak","Colchuck Peak - Colchuck Glacier 5/26/2005","A nice solo climb - my first outing of the season since coming home for the summer. Left Sammamish at 5:15 and got to Stuart Trailhead at 7:40, got going at 8. Cruised up the trail to Colchuck Lake, which was completely melted out.  \
\
After a couple photos of Colchuck and Dragontail in the morning light from Colchuck Lake, I continued up to the Colchuck Glacier. Getting here early was essential to limit the amount of postholing. The snow on the glacier was powdery (over a foot deep or more) with a crust that broke through most of the time - postholing gets bad after the sun hits the glacier at about 11 am. I arrived at the summit at 11:40 and took a half hour to enjoy the views. Glissading wasn't possible until the lower snowfields, but I still made good time arriving at the trailhead at 2:45 pm before it got too hot... \
\
The snow from last weekend continues to hang onto the rock ledges of Dragontail, Colchuck, and Stuart (almost Himalayan looking) making for sweet photography scenes. Saw only a couple hikers on the trail who were enjoying the beautiful weather and views. This is a highly scenic area and a great time of the year to visit!"
"Silver-star-mountain-okanagan","TR: Silverstar Mountain - Silverstar Glacier 5/29/05","With the weather pattern changing, Bjorn and I decided Silver Star. With its easterly location and nice vantage point, it was a safe bet and a good early season conditioner. We left the Seattle area Saturday afternoon and spent the night at the turnout off highway 20. We brought some lawn chairs, delicious burritos and then enjoyed a warm night under the stars. \
\
We woke up around 4:30 am and set out from the parking lot at about 5:05. We cruised up to Burgundy Col, mostly staying to the right of the col on heather benches and then traversing over to avoid loose scree. The snow on Silver Star Glacier was soft with some postholing on the lower slopes, but not too bad. There was also some small avalanche activity off the west peak. From the col at the top of the Silver Star Glacier, thigh deep postholing for a couple hundred feet was quite annoying (a frozen crust with deep soft snow beneath) but it improved near the summit. The small bit of rock scrambling near the very top was enjoyable.\
\
Pushing the pace early on allowed us to summit at 8:30 with bluebird skies and great visibility of the range from Glacier to Baker. We enjoyed a half hour on the summit with photos and food leaving just after 9 am. The descent went quick and I arrived at the car about 6 hours after beginning at 11:05. I was glad we finished early, the puffy cumulus clouds we saw as we drove off apparently blossomed into a thunderstorm by afternoon...\
\
Silver Star afforded some very nice views thanks to the great weather and visibility. Starting early provided nice photography of Liberty Bell and Early Winter’s Spire in the soft morning light from Burgundy col. I thought it was cool that Dome Peak and the immense Chickamin Glacier become visible on this climb from a relatively low elevation."
"Mount-shuksan","Shuksan - North Face","Josh drove Gary and I up to the Mt Baker ski area saturday morning where we parked at the gated road up to the lower lodge.  \
\

and camped in the last spot that wasn't snow covered just above a source of running water.\
\
[img:1617d3yp]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/zman2208/shuksan2%2027&#46;jpg[/img:1617d3yp]\
\
It was hot.\
\
It was too warm for me to wear any of the clothes I brought with pockets so I didn't have any place to keep my camera on summit day, so Gary will have to post his pictures to fill in.  I led out of camp at about 3:45 sunday morning through wet snow for a bit over a thousand feet to the steepest part of the small glacier on the north face.  I fell about eight feet into a moat, got soaked by a couple waterfalls pouring nearby the edge of the glacier, and punched into a few crevasses up to my waist before handing the lead over to Gary.  \
\
Gary took us out of the wet snow onto some hard ice and a good stretch of fun, firm climbing where he found good screw placements.  We got out onto the upper face and took a break out of the fall line of the large, exposed seracs.  I was still pretty tired from the initial trailbreaking and Gary volunteered to keep leading so off he went as the sun rose.  It was more wet snow, but Gary just kept going, kicking steps for about a thousand feet over a bergshrund to the edge of the Hanging Glacier.  By the end I was just keeping pace, Gary really motored up the slope.  I led us across the Hanging Glacier to the col between the Hanging and Crystal Glaciers.  Part way across we stopped and rested, and Josh lost the handle on his beat-up thermarest which proceeded to roll straight down the Hanging Glacier out of sight.   At the col the full heat of the sun really hit and I was sweating just sitting down.  \
\
The view from the col was awesome, a marine layer had fogged up the valleys and the north faces of the Cascades to Glacier Peak floated above.  The view east and south from the col:\
[url:1617d3yp]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/zman2208/shuksan2%20pano3&#46;html[/url:1617d3yp]\
\
The heat turned the snow pretty sloppy as we walked all the way around to the Sulphide and the south gully up the summit pyramid.  There were no less than 26 people there going to the summit that morning-afternoon and so it took us quite awhile to make the last few hundred to the summit, about as long as it took us to climb the north face.  After a group of Mazamas retreated down the main gully, which was constantly experiencing spontaneous slough slides and rock fall, we started up the southeast ridge.  It was 4th class and easy fifth on only fairly crappy rock with lots of broken stuff to sling for pro.  Gary led all five pithces or so to the summit which Josh and I followed.     \
\
[img:1617d3yp]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/zman2208/shuksan2%2043&#46;jpg[/img:1617d3yp]\
\
Another party going down the southeast ridge.  \
\
[img:1617d3yp]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/zman2208/shuksan2%201&#46;jpg[/img:1617d3yp]\
\
The summit, clear skies, doesn't get any better.  Striving to stay out of the gully I downled the ridge for a few pitches and we rapped off of rings back to the Sulphide.\
\
We had been speculating about the routefinding down our intended descent, the Fisher Chimneys route, when we saw a party come up over Hell's Highway.   We intercepted them and they confirmed the route was good to go, all we had to do was follow their tracks.  So down we went on the Upper Curtis Glacier, and then back up, then down the White Salmon Glacier to the entrance of the chimneys.  The chimneys were loose, wet, and scared me in several places.  The going was not particularly hard, but if you got off route the exposure and difficulty increased dramatically and quickly.  Some wrong turns, some chimney downclimbing, and a lot of cautious scrambling brought us back to the snowfield overlooking the Lower Curtis Glacier where we picked up fresh tracks again.  I was losing energy quickly as we descended into the valley to Lake Anne and were encased by fog, limiting visibility to less than 100 feet sometimes.  Gary generously gave me some oatmeal he had been saving which was just enough to get me moving again.  \
\
We were sitting on the ridge above Lake Anne discussing our route in the whiteout when Josh flagged down a group of two.  They were half of the team that we had passed earlier who had climbed the Fisher Chimneys that day.  One of them knew the way quite well and led us cross-country, intermittently returning to the trail.  They also offered to drive one of us back to our car parked at the lower lodge from their car at the upper lodge so we wouldn't have to walk the road.  So Josh kept up with the spry old-timers and they took off, leaving Gary and I to follow their sparse tracks through the whiteout back uphill to Austin Pass and the upper lodge.  We lost their path frequently and had to make many stream crossings, but we ended up getting to the upper lodge where they were waiting just as darkness fell.  Josh was there, but only one of the crew from the Fisher Chimneys group was left.  So their single remaining climber drove Josh to pick up our rig and Gary and I waited at the gated road thinking about what we would do if the three climbers didn't make it out that night.  After a 19 hour day we weren't going to be much use, but the three climbers caught up momentarily so we merely had to drive ourselves home.  Josh wasn't feeling well however, and after an hour of driving I was getting pretty sleepy so the driving ended up being trickier than I had hoped.  Gary finished it off though, and we got back to the U-district at 2 am, so 23 hours after we got up we could finally go to bed.  \
\
This was one of the most spectacular days I've spent in the mountains: six glaciers, some 6000 feet of vertical gain, incredible views, intense sun, and none of it coming easily, even had to walk out in disorienting whiteout on featureless snowfields to the very end, and had two awesome people to share it with."
,"Stiletto Buttress &amp; Twisp Mtn 29-30 May 05","“Where do you want to go this weekend?” I asked.  \
“Some place none of us have been to,” Lissa replied.\
\
And so Saturday morning found Lissa and I headed out of Seattle at 4:00 am bound for the Methow Valley.  We rolled into Twisp around 8:00 and met up with Brad at the Cinnamon Twisp Bakery for honey glazed blueberry rolls, Cinnamon Twists and lemon poppy seed muffins.  Yum.  Already the trip was off to a great start.  \
\
By 10:00 am the three of us were on our way to Twisp Pass.  The trail is in good condition and gradually gains about 2000’ over 4.5 miles to the pass.  About halfway up it leaves the shaded forests of the Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness and enters into a valley of low alpine meadows thick with blooming wildflowers (lupine, phlox, paintbrush, arnica, etc.).  We stopped near a talus field to watch a few pikas scurry amid the rocks and we basked in the 90 degree heat with views of Crescent Mountain and South Creek Butte to the south.\
\
At Twisp Pass we crossed into North Cascades National Park, where Lissa and I were greeted with our first close encounter with a mountain goat.  It came bounding down from the direction of Lincoln Butte, saw us and charged back in the direction it had come from, almost as fast as Gary heads up a trail  <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\"" alt=\"":lol:\"" title=\""Laughing\"" /><!-- s:lol: --> .  We followed the goat in hopes of getting a good photo op, but ended up with views down to McGregor Mountain.  Looking over the valley we scoped out our prospects for the days’ adventures, with just an overnight trip we decided we’d go for Stiletto Peak (7660’) and Twisp Mountain (7161’).  \
\
We traversed across the ridgeline between Lincoln and Stiletto through rolling alpine meadows, budding larch stands, and patches of snow onward to Stiletto Falls.  Upon replenishing our water bottles we headed up to the bench above Stiletto Meadows and set up camp at ~6700’.  \
\
Lissa and I decided to go for a pre-dinner scramble up the buttress of Stiletto, while Brad went off to take some photos.  Our guide book (not Beckey mind you) seemed to indicate a route up Stiletto along the very exposed SE ridge.  Certainly doable as a climb, but not quite the scramble we were looking for.  Hence we went for the buttress to scope out other options.  The buttress rock is solid class 3 with a few class 4 spots, but for the most part exposure was to a minimum.  We peaked out somewhere around 7200’ and soon saw Brad coming up behind us.  From the top of the buttress we could see a great ridgeline along the NW side of Stiletto that winds over on the backside to the NE side which would make for a nice scramble to the top…to be done on a return trip for sure as well as an exploration of the old lookout ruins across Stiletto Meadows; still covered in snow.\
\
Back at camp we dined Alps style on fondue and fine red wines (thanks to Brad and Lissa) while watching the alpine glow set in over McGregor, Frisco, Hock, Glacier and the sea of other Cascade peaks.  \
\
Sunday we planned our route to Twisp Mountain, while ambling south down the meadows, passed sun tanning hoary marmots and yellow glacier lilies in their prime, to Dagger Lake.  We decided to go cross-country passed the lake up to 6000’ to snowline, for what looked from across the valley-two miles away-like a reasonable traverse.  We dropped our packs around 6100’ and bounded up the rocky alpine meadows.  Lissa and I perfected our cairn building skills along the way.  The westside of Twisp Mountain is pretty much a nice, steep walk up with pink and black spotted granite talus to scramble the last 500’ up.  Views from the top showcased Gilbert, Abernathy, and Stiletto which framed the fine peaks of Washington Pass.  Hock Mountain, just a mile southwest of Twisp, had an especially enticing spur among its craggy peaks and cornices along its westside that would make for another good return trip.\
\
Once back to our packs the great traverse began (at least bushwhacking purgatory if not close to bushwhacking hell, Philadelphia Mt. eat your heart out).  It was slow going through dense, westside-esque vegetation.  After an hour and a half of harassment from trees, thigh-high post-holing and sketchy green belays that resulted in us covering less than half a mile, we were fed up and opted for heading straight down to Dagger Lake, and onto the most glorious of al things: a trail.  As we bogged our way across to the lake, thunder rumbled in the distance and the azure skies and puffy white clouds were swept away by more ominous looking gray clouds.  We made it back up to Twisp Pass just as the thunder really began to clap and lightening flashed across the valley.  On our way down we were pelted with pea sized hail and intermittent showers.  We were back at the trailhead by 6:00 pm, pealed off soggy boots and headed to the Methow Valley Brewery in Twisp for dinner.  Their porter, cherry stout, and pear cider are highly recommended.\
\
In all, an amazing and beautiful trip and great overnighter for a hot weekend.  We covered about 9 miles on Saturday with 4000’ gain and another 8-9 miles and 3500’ gain on Sunday.  Saw one day hiker on Saturday at Twisp Pass, two guys camped at Dagger Lake Sunday morning, and two day parties headed to the pass on as we came down…not bad numbers for Memorial Day weekend.  Good times… more like great times had by all."
"Mount-rainier","Rainier - Ingraham Direct","Erik Howard & I climbed the ID. Left Paradise @ 2pm sat 28th.  Went nice & slow to Muir so we wouldn't wear ourselves out, got there @ 5:50pm.  We got to the hut & there were only 3 ppl in there, I was shocked.   I thought we were going to have to bivy outside, but we took spots in the hut instead.  I used the pad from my pack & Eriks for my sleeping pad, it worked but pretty small so I'm glad we got to sleep in the hut & not outside.  We melted water & all that junk, talked to the people in there.   It took a long time to melt snow & it seemed everyone was having trouble with their stoves going out, maybe not enough oxygen in the hut?\
There was a couple from LA that had came up and were doing it in 3 days.  The guy carried a 70lb pack & the girl carried a 45lb pack.  The guy's pack weighed more than Erik & my packs combined!  I couldn't believe the stuff they carried.  They brought so much food, I was definately jealous when we were in the hut, but glad it didn't take us 7 hours to get to Muir.  \
We went to sleep at around 10 or so, & it sucked because my boots were super soaked already & I kept having to pee, but didn't want to put on wet boots to go outside.  So I tried holding it, which makes it hard to sleep. \
Our plan was to leave @ midnight because we talked to a group of 3 that left @ 2 & got to the summit @ 1030.  They said it was real slushy coming down so we wanted to get down earlier.  Anyways, as usual we slept in (eff!) and I woke up @ 1:15am freakin out.  So we were moving by 1:45.  That rock straight across from muir was interesting crossing because there was rockfall at like 2am & I got hit in the foot by a rock.  But it was super warm out & I had to take a bunch of clothes off right away, I  was just sweating too much.  The trail was perfect, we didn't have to kick steps at all & the crevasses were easy to cross.  The sunrise was hella sweet & that marine layer thing everyone talks about was in full effect, for some really cool photos.  \
We caught up to the rmi groups & stuff @ like 13000 ft & were stuck behind them the rest of the way up.  Got to the summit @ what I thought was 8, but that gib ledges TR on cc.com said they got there @ 6 & we got to the summit at the same time, so I dunno.  Maybe we left @ because we got back to Muir @ 1030.  Anyways, the summit was hella sweet, but super windy, so we took a few photos & went back inside the crater.  Erik threw up right below the summit (all he consumed was gu & cytomax & then part of a freeze dried meal the night before).  So I imagine he felt pretty wasted after throwing everything up.  Everyone left the summit so we started cutting down & passed a RMI group and some other rope teams, then got stuck behind 2 of them that got their ropes tangled up (no clue how) & had to wait like 15 mins.  \
On the way up we felt great till a little after 13,000 & then we were stuck behind those groups, but also felt slower.  But I slowed down on drinking water cause it was so windy I didn't want to stop & I was almost out (2 liters carried).  \
When we got to Muir we packed everything in a hurry, told ppl about the route & headed down, no glissading which sucked big time & made me take off all my clothes again.  Erik laid in the rocks for like 15 mins @ one point & I just kept going - thinking about the water I had at the car & Scaleburgers. We got to the car @ 1pm.  \
Something that was pretty cool was that sat. afternoon & sun when we got back there were a lot of babes walking around & going up to Muir (very distracting  <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\"" alt=\"":lol:\"" title=\""Laughing\"" /><!-- s:lol: --> )\
The views were great though and that marine thing was in every direction, so it looked like an ocean of clouds for as far as you could see with mtns poking through the tops.\

I wish I would have taken more but was too lazy to get it out of my pack plus didn't want the batteries to die before the summit."

"Mount-shuksan","TR: Shuksan-Fisher Chimneys . . .","... well, I guess we could of counted it in a game of horseshoes.  With the forecast looking prime for the three day weekend, I called my old climbing partner in Spokane and coaxed him(didin't take much, really) into making the drive out.  We settled for the Fisher Chimneys and got a late start Saturday.  \
    \
The trail to Lake Anne was patchy snow through the lower meadows, and continuous by the time we started up toward the lake.  We spotted a pair of climbers hiking out, but never crossed paths with them.  By this time, it was getting late and we bivied on a nice dry spot above the frozen lake.  \
   \
 We left in the morning for the Chimneys, having no idea what kind of conditions we would find on this unfamiliar route.  The traverse up from the lake was uneventful under beautiful, clear morning skies.  We followed the boot tracks of the earlier climbers across a steep snow slope under cliffs to the entrance of the chimneys.  The route was dry except for a single steep snow finger with easy step kicking.  A well beaten boot path up and through the gulleys made routefinding reasonably straight-forward.  There were two or three spots that we both agreed would make for unpleasant down-climbing with heavy packs(in particular, a spot where one had to shimmy sideways, clinging awkwardly to the rock, with a sheer drop underneath; was this the \""fat man's misery\"" part of the chimneys that Beckey describes?).  We got safely above and to the base of Winnie's slide between the White Salmon and Upper Curtis glaciers.  We dropped our packs at an established bivy site in the rocks. \
   \
 In a short while, a party of four we had seen below passed by, and we talked briefly.  They were coming from the parking lot and were knocking off the climb in one push.  At this point, the fourth day of scorching weather had convinced me I was back in the Sierra Nevada, and that the high pressure would last till October.  We planned for a lazy afternoon with an early push for the summit and hike back out.  It was in this state, sprawled out on the rocks like basking lizards, that a team of three passed us on the way toward the top of the Chimneys.  We didn’t get a chance to converse, but wondered where their party was coming from, as we hadn’t seen their tracks on the way in.  Only after getting home and reading some TR’s did I realize with some irony that this was a party of  UW climbers coming back from a successful climb of the North Face (nice work, fellas).  \
   \
 As the day wore on, our perfect weather fell under threat from a deep marine layer that rolled in from the west and quickly filled the valleys below.  By dusk on Sunday, a distinct inversion layer had set up, and a thick soup was eddying in the valleys and spilling over the tops of nearby peaks. Baker and Shuksan were rising above the deep soup in perfect, clear skies.  Our camp sat just above the inversion so that we were in and out of whiteout conditions as the light faded.  The prospect of climbing early was starting to look questionable, as we watched previously exposed nearby peaks get inundated by the thickening soup.  We watched the weather through the night, and at first light, woke to the exact same scenario.  The marine layer had deepened and spread further east, but the route to the summit sat in clear blue skies.  We decided to gear up and make for Hell’s Highway, where we’d reevaluate the situation.  There was no around and we really didn’t want white-out conditions on the glaciers.  We roped up and crossed the Upper Curtis glacier, which was in great condition, and made for a beautiful ascent to the edge of the Sulphide.  Looking down, we could see that the Fisher Chimneys were hidden in the soup (more on that later).  As we popped over the Sulphide, we found ourselves completely alone on the mountain.  The inversion layer sat stable at 6000 feet where it had for the past 16 hours, and the pyramid beckoned, so we went for it.  Walking up the empty Sulphide, with only the higher Cascade peaks rising out of a sea of fog, was a sublime moment.  Eyeing the conditions on the summit pyramid, we naively expected that a combination of rock scrambling and step-kicking would get us up the central gulley.  We started up through sloppy snow that had been rota-tilled by the weekend’s parade of climbers.  As we got into the gulley proper, we abruptly encountered a six layer of wet snow over ice, with a long, steep run-out into rocks.  Sloughs of snow were coming of, and a large chunk of broken ice sat near the bottom.  We’d left our glacier rope below, hadn’t brought any rock pro, and felt that our window of weather might be short-lived.  We bailed and made a retreat down the Sulphide in a bitter cold wind.  \
    \
We made it back to camp, where the inversion hadn’t budged for going on 20 hours.  It was early afternoon, and we weren’t about to waste any time getting the Chimney down-climb over with.  We started down in a dense fog and carefully worked our way down.  At one point, a big rockslide came down, close enough to make the ground shudder.  Time to get the f*** out of the chimneys!  At the “fat man’s misery”, I was glad for the first time for the fog, which obscured the drop-off underneath.  We made it safely onto the snow traverse, relieved to be off the Chimneys.  We’d gone no more than a hundred yards when another big rock fall let loose from the cliffs we’d just been in.  Wow.  \
    \
The rest of the afternoon was long and uneventful, as we slogged in dense fog back the way we came.  It was a steady driz by the time we started back up toward the trail head, and we still hadn’t seen anyone.  It was getting dark by the time we hiked through the resort, but still light enough to find unopened easter eggs full of candy in the snow, as if some sympathetic soul had left them for weary climbers.  The only thing sweeter would turn out to be the cold cans of Budweiser waiting for us down the road.  All in all, a weekend not short on adventure and good times."
"Ingalls-peaks","Ingalls Update","I was there yesterday to avoid the clouds on the west side. Clear skies and surprisingly warm. Anyways, there is little snow remaining from the parking lot to Ingalls Pass. Ingalls basin is still mostly snowbound up to the col between north and south Ingalls. Fortunately, it has consolidated some and postholing was not a problem for the most part. The rock on the route is dry. Ingalls Lake is still about 98% frozen."
"North-early-winters-spire","NEWS and SEWS","Jason Killgore and I drove to the Blue Lake Trailhead Friday night and slept in the parking lot, ready to climb a spire or two the next day.  Jason woke up at sunrise and let me sleep another half-hour before getting me up and starting the hike up.  Soon after we left I realized I had forgotten my camera in the car, which was ironic because I had just bought a new case for it and was telling Jason how I was glad I could have my camera accessible on technical climbs again, if I would only remember to get it out of the car.  No worries though, Jason had his camera.  We decided to climb the Northwest Corner on North Early Winter Spire, so heeding the goat tracks we had seen in the snow on the way in, we hung the gear we were leaving behind in some trees and roped up.  Climbed up a couple pitches,\

\
then a few 5.9 pitches, including a challenging undercling which was pretty cool, and the long offwidth that worked me pretty good.  Finally got into the sun after being darn cold at every belay, I should invest in some booties or something to keep my feet warm at the belay,\
\

and finished with some simul-climbing to the summit.\
\
[img:19i1ukfk]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/zman2208/news%203&#46;jpg[/img:19i1ukfk]\
\
Rappelled into the notch between North and South Early Winter Spires and after another rappel in the notch had to do very uncomfortable down-climbing on hard snow.  Hard to get a toe in with rock shoes on, double-ropes would give you many more options here, and keep the snow travel to a minimum.  \
\
The downclimbing took us a long time so we had to push our next climb a bit, the Southwest Rib on South Early Winter Spire.  We climbed up the Southwest Couloir a bit and took the crappy black lichen-covered slab variation to the middle of the route in order to save time.  This went above what is recommended and below the finger traverse described in Beckey,  but it got us where we wanted to go.  The bear hug section was fun, too bad it was so short, and mostly too big for a number 4 camalot, so much for dragging that huge thing all the way up there.   One more pitch after that and we simuled the rest of the way to the summit:\

Downclimbed the South Arete with a big goat who was either really nervous or just showing off as we rappelled past sections he was able to take in one or two jumps.  Two fun climbs,  a grade III and II, does that count as a V?   <!-- s:wink: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\"" alt=\"":wink:\"" title=\""Wink\"" /><!-- s:wink: -->"
"liberty-bell-mountain","Liberty Crack","Ben Long and I climbed Liberty Crack on Saturday.  We started climbing about 6am and got to the summit at 4pm.  Beautiful day and fun climb.  There was only about 30 ft of snow at the base.  We brought one 60m rope, full set of cams with double #1 camalots, lots of nuts and a talon hook.  We used the topo from <!-- m --><a class=\""postlink\"" href=\""http://www.stanford.edu/~clint/wa/libcrack.gif\"">http://www.stanford.edu/~clint/wa/libcrack.gif</a><!-- m --> but extended pitches 7,8 and 9 with 8 and 9 being the full 60m.  The 5.0 slab corner on pitch 7 was a surprise and seemed much harder to me.  Ben took a bunch of pictures that he can post once his exam is finished."
"Garfield-mountain","Infinite Piss","We had heard the rumors.  Pitch after pitch of hiking in your rockshoes.  We decided to do it differently.  We'd start by not bringing rockshoes.\
\
Sunday morning the first pitches were rated a glorious WIwet.  We readily bypassed them through mixed terrain to the right.  \""Could I get choss, moss, choss, and choss without the choss?  What do you mean you don't want any choss?\""  After soloing up a few hundred feet, it was time to bust out the ropes.  We needed to get closer to the route-proper, which we'd do through a lower and a traverse.   The wet slabby traverse involved much water-skiing until we dropped low enough to find a horizontal fault that allowed for easier travel.\
\
The traverse took us to a wooded island amidst a sea of slab.  There lay the mysterious man-whale, beached and flippers flapping in the air.  Did he swim up the waterfall?  Why did he stop here?  And most importantly, who put the Jason mask on his head?  Nonetheless, the man-whale clearly wanted down.  He wasn't all who wanted down.  Several rocks wanted down, or as the Minnesotans say, racks.  We sent the racks down first, though a rock cut to the front of the line and only made it down a ropelength; we disciplined it for its naughty behavior.\
\
The man-whale had a pretty smooth ride down before a bumpier ride below, unicycling above and below logs and weaving around rocks.  When we got back to the cars, we came under heavy fire.  Misguided hillbillies?  Man-whale hunters?  Insurgents?  We honked our car horns to announce our location,  but the attack did not subside.  We decided it was time to resort to our secret weapon and activated it for a few seconds... and then silence.  We quickly drove away with the man-whale before the infidels could regroup, and we hid for an hour in some place resembling Mexico to let things cool down.  \
\
This is the Enigma Range indeed."
,"Is there an I in Liberty?","I'm not looking to counter other's comments here as there is much sound advice found above, only to offer another perspective. To lead '5.9 alpine routes' seems to be taboo in one's first season. In my opinion it's a cultural restraint in our little sub-culture that's strong on ethics. You need to be experienced .. like me ... if you want to do stuff like that. You haven't done Eldo yet, you definitely shouldn't be on NF Shuksan. Maybe it's ok to cross a few trade routes off the checklist.  \
\
In my opinion the easiest way to get comfortable on those mystical 5.9 alpine routes (along with mountain weather, terrain ... unforseen circumstances etc.) is to go do a bunch of them. While certainly true that someone who can lead 11's on gear will be able to move through technical terrain of lesser difficulty more easily than someone at their limit, it seems like there's a built in limiter for those deep in the learning curve. I've also seen much stronger technical climbers fall apart when the pressure cranked up. Playing it safe hadn't taught them how to get through a situation where all the chips were down. Don't push yourself. Play conservatively. These are mountains after all, you should be far below what you're comfortable with. I have friends who are blazingly fast on class 3-5 terrain when this is in fact the upper end of their technical desires or experience. But, they get out and do it on a regular basis. If I'm not mistaken this is what Ben's been doing, getting out there on a very regular basis taking leaps and bounds. And it's my guess he's been getting out more than those of us posting afterwards here.\
\
If your love is in the mountains then moving to the crags isn't the answer. In my estimation Ben wants to climb mountains rather than becoming a rock jock. Know your limits. Know the risks you're undertaking. Jump head-first into the deep end and go for it. Living through the experiences you throw yourself into will reward you immensely with growth across the board. \
\
Colin Child seems to keep learning \""the hard way\"" that limits can be limitied to those that are self imposed rather than the limits imposed by others. And really I don't see a large degree of risk involved if Ben had led the upper pitches. If a point was reached to back off, Baldwin was there to take up the lead. A ropegun can offer a considerable margin of safety. Those who've posted here should know that. \
\
Different philosophies for different people. Some dig dancin 'round the rock. Some just head to the hills.\

"Mount-maude","Mount Maude 6.8-9.05","Margie and I climbed Mt. Maude via the S Face. \
\
After we finished our finals, at 10:30 Wednesday morning, Margie and I headed out to the Entiat range to climb a 9,000’ peak. The day went by slowly after the exam, and the drizzly hike up to Leroy Basin was enjoyable in spite of the conditions and the remarkably steep trail. We got moving about 6:15 the next morning with the intention of climbing Mt. Fernow via the SW Gully/E Ridge route. After cresting the incorrect col at the end of the Leroy Creek gully (7800’), we thought that downclimbing 1200’ of steep glacial ice wasn’t the best idea for this trip. Margie looked downright hypothermic, and we decided to descend to camp to warm up and regroup. \
\
By the time we traversed to our trail down to camp, Margie was feeling warmer and she voiced interest in climbing the S Face of Maude without stopping at camp. After a lengthy traverse below SFJ and Maude, Margie kicked steps up to the lower ridge. Once we crested it, we found that we had, once again, screwed up the route and that we’d have to cross over another ridge (7600’) only to drop down into the big basin south of the S Face. After dropping in and plowing through the worst snow of the trip, we found some thoroughly crumbly class three scrambling that led east to the S ridge where, according to Becky, the (much more direct) correct route joins up from the W face. Once on the ridge, the route was cake. \
\
We descended via Becky’s route and got in a couple of good glissades, with some class three gully scrambling on Entiat gravel towards the bottom. We both enjoyed the trip immensely, even if it was a little long on traversing and short on thinking.   \
\
I think Margie has a few pictures. As soon as they're uploaded, I'll post 'em."
"Snowking-mountain","Snowking Mtn - 6/12/05","After turning around short of the summit on this same hike three weeks ago, I've been itching to get back.  Note to Aaron and Jeremy: at best 3+ hrs from where we stopped to summit.  It's a loooong way along the ridge to the summit. \
\
Charles and I drove in to the \""trailhead\"" on Saturday night and awoke to the sound of rain on the tent Sunday morning.  Pulled on the rain gear and were on our way by a little after 8.  Nice, dry, start to the day.  Ha!\
\
[img:2otooejw]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/bpolagye/snowking%20071&#46;jpg[/img:2otooejw]\
\
The first 2-3 miles of the hike are on FS 1570, now inaccessible due to a deep washout.  Someone has been brushing out the upper road and uprooting saplings growing on the brushy strip between the wheel tracks.  Oddly, they haven't cut any of the larger trees across the road.  Saw of a family of ptmarmigans out for a walk (mother + 6 chicks) near the intact bridge on the upper margins of the road.  \
\
Upon reaching the road's end, we blasted up through soaking wet brush and up the steep climber's path.  Felt kind of like taking a shower.  After getting \""turned around\"" on the way down last time, I was ready for the mountain's tricks and carved a number of directional arrows in the duff at confusing forks.  Which, surprisingly, actually worked to keep us on route on the way down.  On the way up to Pt 5790 (aka Slide Island Mtn) we had beautiful weather.\
\
[img:2otooejw]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/bpolagye/snowking%20079&#46;jpg[/img:2otooejw]\
\
Sometime between Found and Cyclone Lake, the weather started to break a little and visibility increased from 10 ft to about a half mile.  Even had a sucker hole open up that let down some warm sun.  This provided a much needed lift to our spirits since we were both pretty cold and wet from trashing through the brush at the bottom of the climber's trail.  Even got to see where we were headed.\
\
[img:2otooejw]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/bpolagye/snowking%20005&#46;jpg[/img:2otooejw]\
\
After a route-finding SNAFU that brought us too far down to Cyclone Lake (and required some fun heather side-hilling to correct), we reached the base of the south ridge around 12:30.  Couldn't really see much of the summit anymore, but the route seemed like it should be pretty easy to follow, so we decided to go for it (after consuming some welcome food).  Cool views of Mutchler along the way.\
\
[img:2otooejw]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/bpolagye/snowking%20014&#46;jpg[/img:2otooejw]\
\
Ascended snow and talus to the base of the summit block, where we left our poles and scrambled rock and snow to the top.  Summited with limited visibility around 3:00.\
\
So here's the weird thing.  On the summit, with the exception of a few minutes of Mutchler, we were in a 360 degree white-out.  But right overhead was a huge sucker hole of blue sky.  So we took a nap on the summit for about a half hour, enjoying the sun, then headed back down. \
\

\
Managed to stay on trail the whole way back (something of an abberation for Charles and I) and returned to the car around 8:45.  Sucker hole closed over at the bottom of the south ridge and we were back to low visibility and heavy, wet snow as we headed back to Pt. 5790.  Of course, the clouds had cleared by the time we got back to the car.  Ah, how the North Cascades taunts the hapless hiker.  Can't wait to go back.   <!-- s:twisted: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_twisted.gif\"" alt=\"":twisted:\"" title=\""Twisted Evil\"" /><!-- s:twisted: -->"
,"Gators Are For Chumps","This was typical. A part of me couldn't wait to get out there and suffer. But the larger part of me wanted nothing to do with this enterprise. The taste of summer had quickly blackened. Rain kept taunting me as I drove through the north cascades. I should have gotten an earlier start- should have foreseen half of the snafus I'd have. I value sleep. On this day I was dropping stores of suffering in the bank. Why hadn't I been getting out? It was sorta stupid to try this sort of thing  off the couch as my friends say. Whatever. It'd just add to the suffering. \
\
In 7 hours we were about to find out about this approach steeped in mystique. Would it be the 5 hour breeze Nick was told of or would it be the day and a half march through hades I'd been informed of? \""They must of had drastically different conditions.\"" I don't think so. They were on the same trip together. The approach time didn't seem to matter now. In my mind it was still infinite just like the rain. \
\
I finally made it to sleep in the back of my car. The headache brought on by gas fumes lingering in the carpet only added to the situation. I hated this particular morning. It called for action when that was the last of my desires. Nick was early. That figures. I've heard him claim to appreciate suffering. I packed quickly- nothing like a slow girl to cure a slow boy. \
\
Four flat miles went uneventfully. I think the light drizzle even disappeared at times. This was the road section along Goodell creek. The road is well on its way to rejoining the medevil forest. We began to ascend. I walked in and out of consciousness. I hated, no, loathed, slow travel. There wasn't really much I could do about it though. As expected the elevation was not our main combatant. The spirit of this place seemed to be against us as we weaved our way through. Stuck. Stop. Fight. Stuck. Stop ... Stuck. Surrender. \

\
I may have made fun of gu in the past but I was devouring one of it's cousins at an alarming rate. The caffeneine consumption worried me a bit but to tell you the truth I didn't really care about feeling the guilt of running away from BYU. I didn't care about the now pounding rain. And I certainly didn't care that we were going to sleep in the unjustly steep forest. We'd be in Crescent creek basin the next day. That seemed certain but about as far off as the strip in Miami. At least the day ended as it should with dinner and sleep. \
\
Morning came. I was in a different world from the previous morning. Hopes and dreams were simple. Would my hips hold out against the battering? Would my quads start cramping bad?  Banana chips, water, bars and that gu relative didn't seem to be living up to the hype or hope of nourishment. I started using devils club to pull myself up. What did it matter? It was better than slipping and falling on some root I was climbing. The infamous words of Fred Beckey certainly hadn't quit echoing in my head. In coming out to face these demons built up during the sixty some odd years of human visits here I'd come  face to face with my imagination. Perhaps I should have imagined an easier time. Perhaps I sould have dreamed of sunshine and flowers. In my daydreams though I have no memory of sleeping on a series of roots like the night before. Wow, I'd outdone myself. \
\
The basin! Finally. The sun even came out for a sec. Well this was probably a bit of a stretch but from living in Seattle during the bad years even a hint of the sun was the real deal. \
\
\""What should we shoot for today?\"" This caught me by surprise. I'd been looking forward to escape, laying in my sleeping bag, staring at the tent and thinking about ... nothing. I hadn't been thinking about the peaks above or The Barrier for some time now. \""Let's get some food. I'm wrecked.\"" And just like that my luck was running its usual magic. Wet snow started to fall. The tent came out and soon I was in dream world.\
\
At first this simple world was devoid of thought. A pleasing euphoria had set in. we had stopped and I was in the most perfect place. Slowly the cares of this world shuffled in my mind. Before long I was dreaming. \
\
Strangely things started out only scores of miles to the south. The Columbia River was perfect glass. I was by myself, driving, listening to songs that sounded much tinnier than just the MP3 compression defects.  Jet black clouds flirted with the white puffies. I didn't really seem to be concerned. I gave my forest pass to Nick. I had a forest pass! Next thing I knew I was hiking. Yes hiking, up a trail I'd seen many times. There weren't many secrets on this  path. In 2 easy hours I'd be at Colchuck Lake. It didn't matter I was way out of shape. First bridge, second bridge, zig zags, camp. Food. Ahh food. Nick went to bed early. I watched a stranger pass. Later he returned and asked about his partners. I'd seen one soul and that was him. More time passed. Things became fuzzy and the same voice explained they fire their guns if separated. That kept me awake for a while. Morning comes early in June and this one was no slouch. BILLLLL!!! Scottteeee!!!!!!!! Nick and I amused ourselves while scrambling up the morraine. What a strange night. \
\
Poonless at first, I advanced into the shade. Dragontail rears up from just about every side. Moving up the snow seeing only rock above I reaffirmed my earlier statements. \""This isn't even really a glacier man, you'll see. A rope would just be extra weight.\""  Small cracks can usually be countered with some common sense and firm snow. It looked like we had both that morning. I was dying for calories when we dropped our packs at the col. Nick spotted a snaffle. We ran up to the top of Colchuck. Nick wrote a word to the mountaineers. \

\
Eating wasn't doing much for me as my calorie deficit exploded like our nation's deficit. As much as I'd made fun of the Atkins craze there were times I did indeed carry too many carbs. 'Weather' as we called it was coming in. The gully leading up Dragontail seemed a lot more inviting than the trek down to the lake and back up another couple grand of vert. Sure the snow seemed a bit rotten in the narrow section and we didn't know how difficult the terrain to the summit was but ... down to the lake we went. I felt like falling over in the snow for siesta. During a lapse of some sort my feet sailed downhill as I was standing there. Maybe I was turning around. Who knows? As the shaft of my axe drove deep into the snow my right hand grasped the head. Moving again I noticed blood in the snow. Inspection showed chunks missing in two fingers. This was starting to feel like suffering. \
\
Asguard Pass loomed above. The pace felt like a crawl. Somehow we passed people.  Wow this was a popular place. There's nothing like a moment where a previously known fact becomes an ephiphany. Two females were on their way to climb Prusik's West ridge. This wasn't the Bugaboos, they weren't headed in to do grade IV routes, they weren't gorgeous and they didn't sound canadian ... but this was still a very notable event, my first such sighting in the US. \

\
An evening light show made for some Nikon time. I consoled myself in having used the 2 camera bodies, 3 lenses and tripod. At least they all served their purpose; besides carrying 10 less pounds would have been no load at all. As light shows go this wasn't spectacular but it'd been a while so it was a delight to watch the clouds dance among granite. Crimson faded. The inversion cloaking the west side of the crest said goodnite. I made my way to the tent. \
\
Snow fell softly. Dream world shifted gears. The night became colder. I stuffed legs inside my pack, draped the fancy Feathered Friends over my body. Well, I made it 10 years without puncturing a thermarest, but this trip ... this trip finally did it. With more wet snow I got to sleep in. \
\
Screw this. Let's get out of here. I didn't looked forward to the drudgery of this steep descent. That didn't matter; there was only one concern in my mind. Was I going to Seattle or headed back across the north cascades? Five days in the Pickets had seemed like such a noble idea.\

"snow-creek-wall","snowcreek wall &quot;orbit&quot;","The weather this weekend was looking fairly nice so me and Neri decided to do a little climbing, we had first planned to do the Improbable traverse on Guye peak but decided that it was to wet, so instead we made our way to Lworth to climb Orbit. \
\
We left Seattle at 4am after 3 hours of sleep ugh! When we arrived in Lworth the weather was nice sunny and cool!!!  To our suprise there was only two other groups of climbers, and they were doing Outer Space, we jumped on Orbit relishing solitude and peace. I led every pitch but the last two. The upper part of the wall had its fair share of run outs for a wuss like me, but we made it safely to the summit, only to get a huge Thundershower on our heads, we quickly made our way down soaked in water!!!\
\
Luckily we started our climb early, or else we would have been washed off the mountain, the hike back to the car was wet and uneventful.

Trappers Peak is basically a hike, but it affords a stupendous vantage of the Southern Pickets. The \""fence\"" is laid out horizontally making for great photography opportunities. I have a new digital camera and I was eager to test its features in the field. \

\
I set out at 8:45 and reached the summit in about 2 hours. However, I was abit too early as the low clouds had still not completely lifted out of the valley. Over the course of the next two hours, my patient (but chilly) waiting on the summit of Trappers Peak paid off. The Pickets were revealed with great clarity and the \""cloudplay\"" made for some nice photographs. I definitely want to get in there and climb some of those mountains! \

\
New snow deposits were apparent on the rock faces of the Pickets, but even more so to the south on the Snowfield massif and the Eldorado Area. \
\
\
\
The setting of Trappers Peak is interesting. On the one hand, civilization is almost directly below in Newhalem, and on the other hand, some the most wild and remote terrain in the lower 48 is just up the valley. All in all, I was very pleased with this hike and the photographs.\

"Glacier-peak","Glacier Peak Attempt - 6/18-6/19","Short version:\
\
Jim and I tried climbing Glacier Peak via the White Chuck Glacier and got turned back around 9300’ on Disappointment Peak.  Nothing disappointing about the trip, though – the views were spectacular on Sunday.  Long two-day trip, probably better done as a three-day.\
\
[img:1q6n3wnl]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/bpolagye/Glacier/glacier%20031&#46;jpg[/img:1q6n3wnl]\
\
Long version:\
\
Forecast is for partly to completely cloudy with showers?  Why not head out to climb a volcano?  At least that was the way my logic worked.\
\
We car camped at the NF Sauk trailhead on Friday night – lulled to sleep by sound of light rain.  Up and hiking in light rain a little after 7:00.  The Sauk valley was completely socked in – to the point that we only had occasional glimpses of Pilot Ridge on the ascent.  Both of us commented that the clouds were nice, but we could do without the rain.  Reached the intersection with the PCT around 11:30 and saw a group of three dear bounding effortlessly up the hillside.  Wished we were as graceful.\
\
Picked up the climber’s trail at White Pass and started contouring NE to reached the 6500’+ pass described in Beckey.  Not sure if we found the right one, or not.  The climber’s trail, which is very well established abruptly fizzled out in a grassy meadow and the rain intensified.  Cold and damp, we sidehilled on heather and snow to reach the pass.  For me, this was the low point of the trip.  \
\
From the pass, we descended about 800’ to the floor of White Chuck basin and slogged through semi-consolidated snow towards the White Chuck Glacier.  Weather conditions improved a bit – and we were able to see quite a ways across the basin, through a cloud ceiling at about 7000’ blocked views of any peaks.  Almost walked out onto the glacier without roping up thinking it was snowfield, but then noticed a large wedge of blue glacial ice protruding into a half-melted lake.  With no desire to experience more of the White Chuck Glacier than we had to, we chose to quickly gain the rocky ridge that cuts out into the glacier.  From the top, it was easy walking and a short hop up to Glacier Gap.  We had considered trying to move higher to get a jump on the next day, but we were both spent, there were good patches of flat protected ground, and running water, so we decided to stop.  A number of animal tracks were present in the snow.  There was a smaller set that looked like cat tracks and some very large ones that looked distinctly bearish.  I’m not sure what cats and bears eat at 7500’ feet.\
\
As we set up camp and made ourselves dinner, the clouds to the south and east started to break and we even had a few views to the west.  Glacier Peak, however, remained petulantly locked away in clouds.  We were both a little worried about route-finding on Sunday if the weather didn’t improve, so we did went to sleep and decided to see how things looked in the morning.\
\
Woke a little before 4:00 to almost completely clear skies – even towards Glacier.  \
\
[img:1q6n3wnl]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/bpolagye/Glacier/glacier%20032&#46;jpg[/img:1q6n3wnl]\
\
Our misgivings about route-finding vanishing, we shouldered our packs and headed up the ridge from Glacier Gap.  \
\
[img:1q6n3wnl]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/bpolagye/Glacier/glacier%20024&#46;jpg[/img:1q6n3wnl]\
\
Disappointment and Glacier both quickly came into view.  We could see our ascent route, contouring gently up the Cool Glacier to the east of Disappointment Peak.\
\
[img:1q6n3wnl]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/bpolagye/Glacier/glacier%20040&#46;jpg[/img:1q6n3wnl]\
\
We even found traces of old tread (or perhaps we were delusional) on the pleasantly sloped pumice ridge we used to reach the Cool Glacier.  And then everything almost went pear shaped.  Roped up and wearing crampons, we headed out onto the frozen snow covering the glacier.  About a hundred feet out I felt/heard a soft “whump” under foot.  The sound seemed quite localized to my foot, and though both Jim and I had misgivings, we continued on.  Another fifty feet and another soft “whump” underfoot.  “Air pockets?”  “No idea.”  Another fifty feet out.  “WHUMP”  This time the sound was not just underfoot, coming from a large area on the slope.  We simultaneously agreed that it would be prudent to get the hell of the glacier and immediately cut back to climber’s left on the fastest path back to the moraine.  About twenty feet later, I felt the rope go slack behind me and saw Jim moving really fast and shouting for me to go faster.  I readily obliged.  What I hadn’t heard, but he had, was a series of loud whumps on the slope behind us.  Fortunately, nothing let loose and we reached the moraine, exhausted and gasping for breath.  The slope we had been on was no more than 20 degrees, and probably closer to 15.  \
\
Once we had recovered our wits, we took stock of the situation.  Either the slopes we had been on were in danger of releasing in a slab or there was a very large grouse living on Glacier Peak.  The Cool Glacier increased in angle as it rose around the flanks of Disappointment, and if the low-angled slopes had been so unstable, we had no idea what it would be like on the high-angled.  Nor did we have any inclination to find out.  Both of us were reluctant to abandon the summit of Glacier in such outstanding weather conditions, so we decided to see if we could get up and over Disappointment.  I wasn’t quite as hopeful of this plan as Jim since I knew there were some modestly high-angle slopes between Disappointment and Glacier.  We ascended frozen pumice, rock, and snow to about 9200’ on the side of Disappointment.  In the shelter of a rocky outcropping we took break, enjoying spectacular views.  Rainier was clearly visible, as was Adams even further south.  Certainly not mostly cloudy!  Considering the time (8:10), we decided we wouldn’t be able to summit Glacier and get back to the car at a reasonable hour.  I decided that I’d give a go at the summit of Disappointment and started heading upslope on frozen snow.  Conditions were less than optimal.  I had to slam my foot repeatedly into the snow to break the icy crust, but once I did, all that was underneath was poorly consolidated powder.  After about 100’ vertical of this, I was exhausted and mentally past the limits of what I consider to be acceptable risk.  Decided that at the pace I was moving, it would take the better part of an hour to reach the summit (and once I did, I might be too tired to safely downclimb).  So, exercising the better part of good judgment, stopped, drank some water, ate some food, took some pictures, and started kick stepping back down to Jim.  \
\
Though we were both “disappointed” (ha ha) to have not reached either summit, the views and solitude we enjoyed were adequate compensation.  Descended in good time back to Glacier Gap.  I took a short side trip to Pt. 7622 above the gap (“Dammit, I’m going to summit something after all this trouble!”) then enjoyed some dry hill skiing on pumice back to camp.  Packed up and moving around 11:30.    \
\
The hike out was long and hot, though we had much better views than on the way in.  Looking back towards Glacier (now clearly visible with the limited cloud cover) we saw what appeared to be a massive crown from a slab release into the Glacier-Disappointment Col.  I was much tenser on the way out across the White Chuck Glacier after our close call with avalanches on the Cool and moved pretty slowly with a lot of probing.  Found some odd mini-crevasses (a few inches wide) on the traverse back to the rocky ridge from Glacier Gap, but neither of punched through anything on the slog out.  Snowshoes might have been nice here, but our packs were heavy enough without all the extra weight.  After a painful climb back to the 6500’ saddle, and annoyingly long contour on the climber’s path, we reached the junction with the NF Sauk trail around 16:00.  Jim commented that he’d never been so happy to have only 9 miles left to go.\
\
Reached the car a little after 21:00, exhausted, but quite pleased that we’d gotten as high as we had.  Managed to scrounge up some fast food at Exit 206 on the way back and, thanks to the wonders of caffeine, made it back to Seattle a touch before midnight.  \
\
Saw one pair of hikers and one pair of climbers on the way out.  The climbers were heading up to do the same route as we had, though they seemed oddly unfamiliar with the distances and elevations involved.  “2 or 3 miles from here to the glacier, right?”  This was about a half mile from the Mackinaw Shelter, so maybe 9 miles and 4500’ from the glacier.  At a little after 18:00.  Apparently, they had been told by a ranger (?) that the trip would be a piece of cake.\
\
Distance: 30+ miles (20+ on trails, 10 on snow and pumice)\
Elevation Gained: 7200’ (though lots of ups and downs to keep things interesting)"

\
\
LONG VERSION (get it? sorry thats terrible)\
\
\
One of the first scrambles I did when I started last summer \
\
was cascadian and I had to turn back because of snow over \
\
talus.  This year I also climbed the Stuart Ice Cliff but we \
\
opted not to tag the summmit, So summit fever was setting \
\
for me with Stuart.  The intent was to stand on the summit \
\
at all costs, except injury to myself <!-- s;) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\"" alt=\"";)\"" title=\""Wink\"" /><!-- s;) -->, and with a need to \
\
train for glacier peak in mind, I decided to do Cascadian as \
\
fast as I could.  Just to make sure, I left from North Bend \
\
at 4:30 in the morning.  Arrived at the Trailhead at 6,and \
\
was off by 6:15am.  I arrived at longs pass at 7 exactly, \
\
bypassing alot of the switchbacks along the way.  And then \
\
was at the start of the climbers path by 7:30am.  There were \
\
some ominous clouds trying to climb over ingalls peak but \
\
they appeared to be doing so without any progress so I \
\
headed on up Cascadian reaching the false summit at 9:30am \
\
and realizing I was going to have way too much time to kill \
\
and that mistakes are made when your tired, I relaxed and \
\
picked my way along some class 3 (by traversing too high on \
\
the ridge) to the summit arriving at 10am.  The sun was \
\
shining bright and the clouds were hanging far off so I felt \
\
inclined to relax on the summit, have a snack, sign the \
\
guest register, check my cell phone service(nothing), and \
\
wait to see if something would calve off the ice cliff, to \
\
my dissapointment,it was dead quiet up there for the whole \
\
hour.  I enjoyed a loaf of bread and some cookies, and was \
\
hoping to run into some other climbers since I brought way \
\
too much food, but I was up there too early for that. So I \
\
started down at 11am had a fun out of control glissade, and \
\
then plunge stepped the dirt whenever possible, reaching \
\
Ingalls creek at 12:30.  I iodined some water and headed \
\
back over longs pass and then straight down the middle of \
\
the switch backs and was back at the car at 1:45.  Spent 20 \
\
minutes stretching and 10 minutes in the nearby creek.  I \
\
set the timer going on my watch when I started, it read 3.5 \
\
hrs at the summit and 7.5 at exactly back at the car, though \
\
I had to run the last bit at 7 hrs 25 minutes.  Anyways I \
\
know I'm belaboring the time,sorry, I was using this \
\
scramble to test my pace.\
\
Notes:\
\
Cutting those horribly long switchbacks will save you around \
\
45 minutes.\
\
Snow conditions: \
Hard, got my light hiking boots in about .2inches on a 60 \
\
foot traverse, good thing there were some steps on the only \
\
other 100 foot section of steep snow  The route is almost \
\
snow free but an ice axe might still be worthwhile for those \
\
who like to glissade.\
\
Gear:\
Yourself, a mind to suffer a bit, a pen for the summit log, \
\
definitely some gaitors for the descent, cascadian has \
\
plenty of loose dirt and rocks, I also discovered that no \
\
rock is too big to start sliding when you stand on it. <!-- s;) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\"" alt=\"";)\"" title=\""Wink\"" /><!-- s;) -->  \
\
And a camera.\

"Argonaut-peak","Argonaut","I did Argonaut from the south June 25-6. I think this is the route Becky describes as class 2. Bollocks.\
\
[img:3h0zx1rx]http&#58;//www&#46;seektruth&#46;org/peaks&#46;jpg[/img:3h0zx1rx]\
Argonaut is on the far left, and looked more imposing than Colchuck or Dragontail to this climber.\
\
We came in on the Beverly creek trail for a few miles, turned right to go up to the pass, and meet the Fourth creek trail to descend to our campsite. We camped at the established site just past Ingalls creek. There was a log to cross on just downstream of where the trail hit the creek. Oddly enough, I was the only one (of five) to cross just by walking (linear momentum good, angular momentum bad! And no, I won't quit my day job as a physicist) - everyone else straddled it and scooted across. Including people who would free solo exposed rock that would scare the pants off me. Go figure.\
\
This being a Mountaineers climb, we didn't really know each other, so we mostly had separate sleeping arrangements. I ordered a solo tent last week, but it wasn't in stock, so I used my REI minimalist bivy. Good thing it didn't rain. I noticed after setting things up that I'd chosen a spot near a flycatcher's nest. When it was gone at one point, I was just able to see a small fuzzy ball inside that opened a tiny beak to the sky.\
\
We got up at 5:00, and headed up the trail, to the right at the fork. There we were supposed to find some climbers' trail 250 feet down. We thought we found the right spot, but then discovered the error in our ways. We went up the slope through pines for a while, then fought our way through a lengthy stand of alders that should have been dressed in black latex. These things were seriously into S&amp;M, and we, sadly, were on the 'M' end. We found the trail near the top, a bit west of where we'd been. Following the trail on the way back was much easier - it had a lot less through the alders, and was more clear - but it reminded me of the famous quote from [i:3h0zx1rx]Macbeth Goes Climbing[/i:3h0zx1rx].\
\
[quote:3h0zx1rx]
Out, out brief pathway!
A poor passage that twists and turns its moment on the mountain
and then is gone.
It is a trail made by an &lt;strike&gt;idiot&lt;/strike&gt; mountaineer,
full of brush and steepness,
signifying nothing.
[/quote:3h0zx1rx]\
\
Why is it that mountaineers who can master a z-pulley set up can't figure out how switchbacks work?\
\
Above the alder we crossed a clearing (marked by a cairn and surveyor's tape). From here we gained a ridge and walked through the heather for a while, then dropped into the main gully (around 6000' I think). The gully was class 2 to begin with - so far so good for Becky. We headed up towards a couple rocks that reminded me of the giant stone statues with outstretched hands in Lord of the Rings.\
\
[img:3h0zx1rx]http&#58;//www&#46;seektruth&#46;org/sentinal&#46;jpg[/img:3h0zx1rx]\
\
Higher in the gully we turned right, towards the smooth summit slabs. The gully was now class 3, with some class 4 maybe. The rock is nasty - a lot of loose stuff, although only one person (at the bottom, thankfully) was sending much down. Much of what wasn't loose was wet from the stream running down. This stuff surprised me somewhat by being easier to downclimb than go up.\
\
At the top of the gully on the right we found a narrow, steep gully leading to the summit ridge. We roped up for this, as it was exposed class 4 (or possibly very low class 5 given one move at the top to get around a chockstone).\
\
Once on the ridge we walked/scrambled west to the summit, up a bit of snow to the keyhole. The only slightly difficult bit there was getting over the rock at the bottom of the keyhole, and this was harder to do down than up. It must be even a bit harder when there's no snow, since I assume the added height of the snow helps. We rappelled down the narrow gully and downclimbed the rest.\
\

Colchuck and Dragontail from Argonaut.\
\
This turned out to be a far longer process than expected, mostly due to one person who was extremely slow. I mean, I was slow coming down - I don't have a lot of experience descending steep, loose rock, and I don't much like exposure - but this guy was a-g-o-n-i-z-i-n-g-l-y slow. We got back to camp about 6:30 (note: all times are hearsay, since I didn't have a watch). Packed up, and left camp about 7:15 (this guy was really slow packing up, too).\
\
There's a fair bit of up to the pass, which is [i:3h0zx1rx]not[/i:3h0zx1rx] something that is pleasant on a hike out after a long day. Ugh. Two of us waited at the top of the pass and the other two caught up, but not, you guessed it, slow guy. The fastest two of us (and really, we weren't going fast - I'm not in good enough shape to go fast after a day like that) then hiked all the way out. On the way we passed a Northwest Youth Center group that had come up to do trailwork. They were apparently camping  [i:3h0zx1rx]on[/i:3h0zx1rx] the trail (to be fair, it was the only large flat spot). They were supposed to have gotten to where we'd camped the night before, which was two hours at a fast pace. And there's no way you can get a large group of teenagers to move at a fast pace. By this time we had our headlamps on, so we felt consoled that someone else was way behind schedule too.\
\
We got out around 10:15, closely followed by one other guy who had carpooled with the person I'd walked out with. So they drove off, and I had to wait until... I don't know, since I didn't have a watch, but I think it was after midnight when slow guy came out with the party leader. We tried to find something to eat in Cle Elum, but the only places open were two convenience stores at gas stations. I tried to find something resembling actual food, and so ended up eating a box of Wheat Thins for dinner.\
\
And then on the drive home our driver started weaving and randomly dropping down to 45 mph on I-90. I decided to drive instead - a good idea, since she was, in her own words, \""seeing triple.\"" Slow guy was falling asleep too. So it was a long, quiet drive and I got home at 3am. Hey, but at least we summited and had good weather."
,"Alpine Lakes circuit","Lindsay, Laura, Kate, JP, and I arrived at Snow Lakes TH around 9:00 AM, after dropping a car at Denny Creek, for a hike.  The weather was overcast and misty; the crowds and mosquitos far and few.  \
\
The trail around Snow Lake is a huge jumble of paths and nonpaths and areas blocked off for restoration.  We eventually found our way to a sign that said:\
     Gem Lake\
     Middle Fork -&gt;\
so we hung a right.  Ten minutes later, we realized we were dropping into the wrong drainage and hiked back up.  When we returned to the sign, we noticed really faintly:\
&lt;-  Gem Lake\
     Middle Fork -&gt;\
so we etched the arrow in more with a knife.  We had characteristic sheep behavior.\
I didn't notice the sign.  The people behind me either didn't look at the sign or saw that Gem Lake was the other way but didn't speak up.\
\
After that short detour, we continued onward to Gem Lake, stopping by a party who thought they had already reached Gem Lake and passing a party coming back down from about 500 feet short of the lake -- they had given up.  We ate and drank and Gem Lake\

\
before venturing onward toward Chair Lake.  We traversed the eastern slopes of Roosevelt, weaving above and below cliffbands.  At one point, the terrain got much cliffier, so we had a little powwow.  We had a GPS so we thought we'd give it a try.  It sucked.  It took ten minutes to pick up the satellites, and then its accuracy was poor.  I didn't get the resolution I wanted on the map to determine up or down.  On the other hand, some old-fashioned scouting directed us to drop beneath the cliffs. \
\
Soon we were overlooking Chair Lake -- just we had to get to the other side of it.  Snow was pretty much gone from the slopes, so we scree-surfed, found some ledges skirting a rock rib, and hiked up talus, then snow, then mud to Melakawa Pass.\

\
We hiked down to Melakawa Lake, seeing a weasel along the way (too far away for a 105mm to do it justice).  \
\
It felt like a long way out to the car, especially when there's still a nontrivial distance to go after crossing under I-90.  \
\
Overall a good trip, though would be much better with snow around Chair Lake (and with better visibility and pleasant swimming conditions).\

"Dragontail-peak","Dragontail, Serpentine arete","Ralph and I climbed the Serpentine Arete on Saturday. We drove up Friday night, slept (poorly) at the free camping spot, and then hit the trail at 5:15 am Saturday. The hike to the lake went quickly, and I was impressed what a pretty spot the Colchuk basin is. No wonder it's a popular camping spot. A quick jaunt up the moraine brought us to the base of the route, and the start of the scrambling. Some class 4 brought us to a sandy ledge, followed by a dirty ramp with some snow that we avoided with some difficulty following blocky terrain. We got around the tower and then climbed the 2 or 3 good pitches on the route. They were indeed very nice, and the grade (5.8 ) felt stiff with a pack on, but was probably right on. After the good stuff, the route slabbed out again, and we had to contend with 1000 ft of scrambling up dirty ramps covered in loose rock. That part was a drag. The last pitch was probably 5.7-8 or so, and gave me a fright when a hold turned out to be portable. I barn-doored to the right as the hold flew off into space, but managed to hold on. Yikes. After another 50 ft of dirty mid-5th, we were on top, right below the summit. \
\
The hike out was first pretty, then tiring and boring. The crampons weren't needed on the descent because the snow was nice and soft. We got back to the car at 9 pm, almost 16 hours after we left. We were both slowed down by some 'digestion issues' and felt that we could probably have been quicker if we'd skipped the burritos and greasy ice cream the night before (FYI: Cold Stone Creamery sucks. Go if you like the taste of pure saturated fat.) It felt good to do the route in a day, although we were a bit disappointed in the rock quality. All in all there are about 4 good pitches on the route, and a huge amount of scrap. The position is pretty hard to beat, though. Good times. \
Ralph should have some pics up soon enough. \

,"The Beer Fairy","Sunday morning and we were hustling up the Snow Lake Trail.  My pack elicited a few smirks, and when they read the sign on the back, a few giggles.\
\
But finally, I had my first customer.  He was expecting a six-pack of Coors.  He was certainly flabbergasted to see a 6-pack of Deschutes, a 6-pack of Big Sky, and a 6-pack of Elk Rock, all chilled on ice.  We took a picture, and then he got his camera out and asked for a picture too.\

"Cashmere-mountain","Cashmere Mountain","The weather was mediocre, and I needed to be in the city Saturday morning for an event at UW.  Cashmere seemed like the perfect objective -- a scenic long-day / easy-overnight scramble in the generally better eastside weather.  \
\
The stars had aligned, and Lindsay, Lissa, Stephanie, Kevin, and myself all had the timeslot open.  So off we went, cruising down I-90.  The LissaMobile zoomed ahead, while the more aged Subaru plodded steady, until, at Cle Elum, it had a pulmonary embolism.  The carburator, where the air and fuel mix, clogged, preventing the car from going above 5 mph or 1000 rpm.  We nursed the car into town and found a mechanic.\
\
Then we needed to call the gals.  Most likely they were in Blewitt Pass, out of reception, and we'd next get them in Lworth.  The other issue was I knew only Lindsay's number off the top of my head, and of course her cellphone would be buried in a pack in the back.  I called my lab, and luckily (not really -- there's always someone there), someone was ably to look up Lissa's and Steph's numbers.  We got ahold of them, and they drove back to Cle Elum.  Magically, the mechanic had fixed the car just as they had arrived (he flushed the carburator).  We thanked him and told him we'd like to pay him for his services.  He asked for $15; we paid him $20.  \
\
We eventually arrived at the TH, about two hours behind schedule.  No big deal though -- days were long.  Another minor disaster -- Lissa's bottle of Irish cream had leaked into her bag.  But she quickly cleaned it up -- no sense crying over spilt milk.  We hiked up to Little Caroline Lake and set up camp there.  We had initially wanted to go further to get in a better position for light, but none was to be had.  As usual good food and drink for dinner, and then it was time to catch some zzzzzzzzzs, the five of us cozy in a Megamid.\
\
Kev got up early to hunt for light, while I preferred to sleep in.  He came back empty-handed and we all slept more.  We had breakfast around 8:00, but it was still nasty outside (there was about 3mm of snow on the ground), so we slept in even more, until around 11:00.  By then the sun had come out and melted the snow, and we headed up Cashmere.\

A thin layer of rime from the night before was melting off the summit block.  \
We traversed on compact snow across the NW face until we could go up the north ridge.  Steps were secure, though they required some effort to kick.  \

At the gas station in Lworth, I got teased by the gals for buying a blackberry sorbet, whereas they bought jerky and chips.  I must not let my figure go south!  On the drive back, we entered nasty rain as we headed west, but the car cooperated until we crested over the cloverleaf on the Montlake-520 exit.  But it started itself quickly enough, and we got home without having to coax it."
"buckner-mountain","Mount Buckner","Margie and I climbed Mount Buckner’s SW Face this weekend via Lower Horseshoe Basin. \
\
Arriving at the Cascade Pass Trailhead, we stopped packing to admire the N side of Johannesburg. After these few moments spent gaping, we hit the trail. After crossing over Cascade Pass and stopping for a brief rain delay under a meager canopy of scrub maple and juvenile cedar, we set up camp under menacing skies. Much to our delight, the clouds thinned overnight allowing us to scout the route during breakers. As it turns out, we should have spent more time figuring out the exit from Lower Horseshoe Basin and less time worrying about the upper mountain. Getting out of and then back into the lower basin were easily the most physically taxing parts of the climb. Beckey refers to a mysterious mining/cable trail, which we half-heartedly searched for but quickly gave up on in favor of some spooktacular waterfall climbing on the ascent and a couple thousand feet of alder swinging on the descent. \
\
The upper mountain was gorgeous, although fog made route finding difficult on the ascent. Margie voted to follow some old glissade tracks that went straight up the main North/South gully. I agreed. This turned out to be the wrong choice. We should have ascended the 40º snow finger/avy chute that branches off to the NE. However, after some loose, wet, gully scrambling W of the summit, we traversed beneath the summit block and topped out only 25 minutes after our turn around time. The descent was beautiful. I set off dozens of wet slides with extremely stylish glissades, scouring the slopes below. A few minutes into the descent we saw a hundred-foot long cornice on the E side of Sahale Peak snap off and plummet roughly 1200’. Soon thereafter there was a small, yet spectacular, ice-trickle that fell off of Buckner’s S Ridge. That’s when the fun stopped and the alder started. Swung down to the lower basin, packed up camp, and returned to the car at 9:30pm. The climbing was fun; the bushwhacking was tiring; and the views were memorable – a great climb in my book."

"Snowfield-peak","TR: Snowfield Peak - Neve Glaicer 6/30-7/1","Short Story: \
\
Climbed Snowfield Peak Thursday and Friday. We encountered everything from white-out and rain to crystal clear skies. We did the approach Thursday and summited early Friday morning. The approach and glaciers were in good shape with only a few crevasses open on the Neve Glacier. The views were awesome and the experience memborable. \
\
Long Story: \
\
It has been nearly 5 years since I last climbed Snowfield Peak. Then, it was my first multi-day mountain climbing trip and travel on an active glacier. I have fond memories of this outing and I thought Snowfield Peak would be the perfect trip for my newbie friend visiting from Dallas, TX. \
\
After waffling on the ultimate decision of where to go, we took a weather gamble and set out for the North Cascades. Clear skies in the Seattle area transitioned to a marine layer and even some drizzle on the drive. We set out from the Pyramid Lake trailhead at 9:30 am and fortunately it was dry there and even a sunbreak making for pleasant hiking. The trail to Pyramid Lake and the climber’s path up to the ridge coming off Pyramid Peak were straightforward. Long, steep, and dry; just like I remembered it. As we entered the subalpine, a huge sunbreak opened up and I thought we were set for good weather or at least an improving trend. I thought maybe I could climb some other peaks in the area in addition to Snowfield – actually I intended to – not to be! \
\
We continued up the ridge to the foot of Pyramid Peak with some minor routefinding making great time. The traverse over to Colonial Glacier was straightforward as well and mainly snowfree. We roped up on the Colonial and ascended to the col between Colonial and Neve Glaciers. At this time, the clouds started streaming over Paul Bunyan’s Stump with a cold wind picking up. We hurried up to the col, arriving at 2:30 pm. Just after we finished setting up the tent, it started to drizzle. It soon turned into a downpour, and combined with the howling winds, we headed straight for the sleeping bags. The rain stopped in the evening so we cooked Lipton’s Teryaki Noodles to warm up. We were still socked in, depressed, etc., and I was starting to regret choosing the North Cascades. However, I had not lost hope. With no “organized” weather system in the vicinity, I knew there was a possibility the marine layer would descend overnight. We set the alarm for 4:30 am in hopes of this occurring. Soon afterwards it started to rain, sleet, and gust even harder than before. I thought it would be a miracle if it cleared. \
\
Well, about 2 am everything became calm and I finally got some real sleep. I woke up at about 4:28 am and instinctively unzipped the rain fly to check conditions. I stuck my head out and I didn’t see a cloud anywhere! I woke Brett up and told him its game time. By the time we got going it was 5:20 am. \

\
The tour across Neve Glacier was awesome and we stopped for photos many times. The snow was hard making for great cramponing. Crevasses are starting to open up in two sections, but they were small and easily negotiable. A quick ascent brought us to the scramble high on the flanks of Snowfield. We summited at 7:00 with grand views 360 degree views. My favorite view is to Austera Towers and the McAllister Glaicer. There was still a chilly wind, but it felt nice in the sun and we ate some granola bars and pita bread. \

A couple thousand feet below, clouds were streaming in from the west and I knew the marine layer would creep up the mountains in a few hours. We left the summit at 7:45 and descended the Neve Glacier. \

\
About three quarters of the way down the glacier we descended into a quickly rising marine layer. Blue skies and sun turned into a whiteout. Orientation through the whiteout took some time, but we made it back to camp just after 9 am. The clouds pulled back a little at the col allowing us to eat some oatmeal, pack up, rest a little, and get one last view of Snowfield. With the fog settling in, we cruised down the Colonial Glacier at 11 am where it was still sunny. The hike down the ridge below Pyramid Peak was nice with the sun shining through. We made it back to the car at 3 pm. \

\
Overall, this was one of my more memorable trips. The views were stellar, but it was the dramatic fashion in which they appeared that will stick with me. I didn’t get to climb any of the other peaks in the area as I had hoped, but I am very satisfied with how it turned out. My newbie partner got a little taste of everything North Cascades!\

"Guye-peak","Improbable traverse 6-4-05","Me and a buddy decided that today would be a great day to do a local alpine climb. We left Seattle area around 5 am, and arrived at the trailhead around 6:00 am or so. After a brutal climb up the main gully, we rested for about 20 mins and then soloed up the first two pitches. I would have liked to have roped up, but there was no point, since there was no protection to place. \
\
The rock at the bottom was CRAPPY!! on a few  occasions I lost a foot hold or two. Wusses like me, pee our pants in such situations..... Finally we made our way to some cleaner rock that presented decent climbing. The traverse itself was very fun yet scary!! We simulclimbed the last few pitches. \
\
Instead of walking off the south side, we decided to rappel on two 70 meter ropes. It was fun, yet id prefer to walk off personally. All in all a fun day, but I dont think id be going back again anytime soom.

,"bald mountain","This spot is about 30 minutes from Sedro Woolley up near Mt. Vernon. It is up along a ridge back behind some mountains. PM me if you want specific directions. It is a beautiful spot, very secluded, quiet, and lush. The boulder field has really bad landings so a heap of pads is a good bet. Negotiating between boulders is also a bit sketchy. The rock is not the best (i.e. not granite). Moderate friction, not many positive holds, lots of moss and lichen. It is a fun spot, a bit far from here, but fun all the same."
"sahale-mountain","TR: Sahale Peak - Sahale Arm/Glacier 7/7/2005","With time and weather constrictions, we climbed Sahale Peak on Thursday. Even though I have done this route many times, the setting and reward is still very worthwhile. We had great weather and pleasant temps. I know that my visiting friend, new to the cascades, enjoyed the trip. \
\
We set out from Cascade Pass at 9:10 am, summited at just after noon, chilled until 12:50 when a large group approached from the Quien Sabe Glacier, and made it back to the car at 3:20 pm. Sahale Glacier is still a snowfield with generally good conditions for kicking steps. The final summit bloc was straightforward and I was glad we had some time before the large group showed up. \
\
Using my previous trips here as a barometer, it seems there is much less snow than usual below Sahale Glacier Camp, but approaching more normal levels above the camp.\

\
We got to camp at about 2:00, giving us a lot of time to lay around in the sun.  Had a lot of leisure time on this trip, felt pretty nice.  \
\
Got up at 4 the next morning and hiked up to the Jack/Maude col over pleasantly hard snow.  Then the long traverse over heather, sandy slabs, and snow to get to the base of the face.\

\
The snow conditions on the face were some of the best I've ever experienced.  Very firm allowing easy front-pointing on the 50 degree slope until my calves started to burn and I would kick hard enough to get a step to rest on.  I dropped one of my gloves about halfway up the face and it slid out of sight, its probably being ground into shreds in the Entiat Glacier now, but luckily it was warm and sunny.  \

Lots of lady bugs on the summit, huge red clumps all over the place.  Slept in on Independence Day and scrambled Seven Fingered Jack; one chossy peak I will probably never climb again.  The view was fantastic though.  \

\
There was a big AAI group that climbed the face on the Fourth who we spoke to on Sunday and then ran into again as we got back to the parking lot.  But in the parking lot I saw one of their party I hadn't seen back at high camp, it was the UW's own Josh Lucas.  He informed me that on their climb they were traveling roped on the traverse from the col to the face when someone fell and he had to stop them with his own body.  Yikes, but everything turned out ok apparently.  People who were there on Independence Day reported much softer conditions and falling cornices so I felt good about our timing."
"Mount-stuart","Mount Stuart","Jim and I kept the teamwork flowing for the second weekend in a row when we drove out to the Esmeralda Basin Trailhead Friday night for a one-day climb of the West Ridge.  This was a fun climb with a lot of scrambling on broken rock.  We found out just how broken when we were simuling past Long John Tower.  \
\
The sandy benches had already yielded plenty of gravel shots both spontaneous and triggered which put us on the alert, and I set off a couple grapefruit-sized bombs that had me scared, and I'm sure Jim much more, that I was going to accidentally halve our rope team.  I thought we were past the worst of it as we made our way up next to a snow-filled gully, but I touched a huge block right at the notch the ridge makes with the Tower and it started to move.  This fridge-sized behemoth started to slide when I put my hand on it, didn't even get a chance to test it, and I had to dig in and push against it with all my strength to keep it from cutting loose.  \
\""Jim, get behind something quick!\""  \
He did and I side-stepped the block and for about a half a second it didn't move and I thought I had steadied it, but then it tumbled, miraculously missing the rope and stopping after about ten feet.  It left a deep hole where it was previously planted, revealing just how large it was, and how tenuous the gullies were.  \
\
Thankfully the weather cleared and we were on the ridge, so no more death blocks to worry about.  But, we spent way too long routefinding on the sections we pitched out on the way to the summit, and ended up not getting out of the Cascadian Couloir on the way down until after dark.  It was after ten and facing the uphill hike back to Long's Pass we elected to get some rest and hike out at dawn.  So we made a fire and slept until the flames would die down, then rekindle it and sleep again, and repeated until the sky lightened.  Erased the traces of the fire and hiked out, enjoying the untrampled flowers that line the Long's Pass trail.  \
\
Anyone know what the wide graded bed is that goes from Esmeralda basin up to Long's Pass?  Snowmobile track, jeep road?"
"Forbidden-peak","TR: Forbidden Peak - West Ridge 7/15/2005","Short Story: \
\
Climbed the West Ridge of Forbidden in a day with descent of Northeast ledges. Both routes were in good shape. It was nice to be the only party on the entire mountain that day. \
\

\
Long Story:\
\
My good friend and I drove out to the Boston Basin trailhead Thursday evening and got a few hours rest before we set out for the West Ridge of Forbidden at 3 am. We knew that weather was coming in Friday, so we abandoned earlier thoughts of doing Torment-Forbidden Traverse. Either way, this was a first time on Forbidden for either of us, so we knew it was going to be fun. Doing an approach we had both never done at night was sure to be interesting. \
\
[img:3th0o787]http&#58;//www&#46;cascadeclimbers&#46;com/plab/data/504/3820DSCN02880001&#46;JPG[/img:3th0o787]\

\
We hit the approach hard with headlamps and made it up to Boston Basin with very little route finding problems. At Boston Basin, we lost the trail to Forbidden somehow, but still cruised up to the West Couloir in good time. The couloir is still snow filled with one moat a little past halfway up that is starting to open, but it’s still straightforward. The snow was soft at the bottom and a little hard towards the top. From the top of the snow, we chose the wrong gully up to the West Ridge which took some time but once on the West Ridge route, we cruised up to the summit, mostly free-climbing, and pitching out the 5.6 pin. We made the summit at 8 am as clouds were beginning to stream in from the northwest. \

\
A few photos (obligatory summit pose) and we were off the summit and rapping off the Northeast ledges. We rapped five times with some scrambling to the last ledge before it cliffs out before the Boston Glacier. Here, the ledge traverse to the East begins, at first descending and then ascending to the col along the east ridge. At this point, the descent should have been easy, but we chose another wrong gully and ended up using some more time to work out a wet, cliffy couloir. We finally made it back to Boston Basin and took a nice break in the last sunlight to eat and rest. The descent from here went quickly and we arrived at the car at 12:30 pm, 9.5 hours after beginning, and just as the rain drops began to fall! \

\
I can see why the West Ridge of Forbidden is a classic: great solid rock, sheer exposure, and impressive views. With an awesome partner and a nice weather window, the West Ridge was really fun. It was also cool to do the route with no other parties on the mountain that day. Route finding cost us at least a couple hours on the approach gullies, but we took it in stride and enjoyed the time on the mountain. Next time, route finding will not be an issue when we climb Forbidden and the Torment-Forbidden traverse. \
\
Used ice axe, small rack. Brought crampons but didn't use them. No snow in basin, trail a little muddy in spots, some large open crevasses in unnamed glacier below Forbidden Peak. \

,"Hurricane-Snowking Traverse (failed) 7/14-7/16","The Plan:\
\
Set up a carry ferry on Wednesday at the Slide Lake TH and the end of Tenas Creek Road.  Over the next three days, our group of four would traverse a high route in glorious weather from Hurricane Peak to Snowking Mtn.\
\
The Reality:\
\
Two of us literally sloshed out of Illabot Creek on Saturday evening, bedraggled and beaten, having been turned back from Snowking and spent nearly half the trip travelling in near white-out conditions.  As we hoofed it back up the road to where the car had been stashed, we weren't capable of saying much more than, \""Epic, man.  Just epic.\""\
\
The Story:\
\
The car ferry got set up on Wednesday night without incident.  Took a little longer than anticipated, but both Illabot Road and Tenas Creek Road were very drivable.  Got a sluggish start Thursday morning, but were up and moving on the fisherman’s trail to Boulder Lake at little after 10.  The trail features an impressive waterfall and looks to have been better maintained in the past.  In fact, there is even a Glacier Peak Wilderness sign at the wilderness boundary, which I didn’t think was that common for a fisherman’s trail.  The fish are nearly jumping out of the water at Boulder Lake for anyone who might be interested in that sort of thing.  Our pace, however, was pretty slow and Charles and I were getting worried about managing the traverse in three days.  We set out ahead of our other two compatriots and headed up to Pear Lake and then up a steep, mossy gully to a saddle below the top of the ridge to the east of Pear.  When the other two members of our party failed to join up with us, Charles and I dropped our packs and, after and hour of traversing the ridge, found them down at Pear Lake, laboring along.  Not good.  Charles and I had badly underestimated how slowly fit, but inexperienced, backpackers move on challenging terrain.  Around 5 PM we pulled in to our camp – a bench about 500 ft above Lake Toketie.  Charles and I decided to head up Hurricane Peak for an evening stroll and took in the magnificent views of Cheval, Buckindy, and Glacier.\
\
That night we discussed our options and decided that we’d split up.  The two less experienced members of our party would head back to the car at Tenas Creek while Charles and I would try to complete the traverse in two days.  Sure the weather looked to be deteriorating, but how bad could it get?\
\
Up and moving early the next morning, we headed north below Hurricane Peak and picked up the ridge running to Pt 6078.  There was a faint climber’s trail for much of the traverse which clung to the top of the narrow, occasionally exposed ridge.  Experienced some nasty side-hilling as we came around the east side of Crater Lake (looks seldom visited).  Once we started heading west around the Crater Lake basin, the slick heather was replaced by large granite blocks which made for really enjoyable walking.  As we reached the 6400’ col to the east of Cheval’s east peak we felt our first drops of rain.  Sure it had been getting cloudier during the morning, but things looked better to the west.  Conditions were bound to improve.  Right?  We glissaded down into the cloud shrouded cirque at the origin of Buck Creek.  On the way down we came across some curious wreckage including a metal tube, canvas, and some small wooden looking floats.  Further down in the basin, I would come across some yellow, rubbery looking fabric and some rusted pole sections.  Someone trying to raft down the cliff bands?  Conditions continued to deteriorate as we descended and soon we were down to only a hundred feet or so of visibility and blowing rain.  The descent down to Buck Creek was pure misery.  Wet brush, no visibility to speak of, and constant green belays.  We missed the correct ridge and halted our descent only when a brief break in the clouds showed the creek floor still nearly a thousand feet below us (the basin should have only been a hundred or so).  In good weather, the descent would probably be straightforward, but in drifting clouds and rain it kinds of blows.  Casualties for the descent: a nalgene bottle, a carbon fiber trekking pole that snapped like a twig, and a pair of boxers that ripped from stem to stern since the designers apparently never thought they’d be worn in heavy rain.  Upon reaching the desolate basin, we took refuge beneath an overhung boulder in the Buck Creek basin, trying to stay out of the rain while we choked down some food.  A few times I thought the rain had stopped, but then realized the wind had intensified and it was just blowing sideways.  This was really the low point of the trip for me – near hypothermic, stuffed under a boulder, with a 1500 ft climb to get up to our camp.  The waterfall coming down over the cliffs of the upper cirque was really impressive, though.\
\
Some additional brush bashing (we were starting to get pretty good at it) got us to the base of a talus slope heading up towards the Illabot-Buck divide.  For anyone who has a hankering to give this route a shot, take the ridge at the east end of the Buck basin all the way down.  By descending into a lower basin you can avoid hopping gravel bars and some of the brush busting and set yourself up nicely to ascend the talus slope.  Once we were back on solid talus, our spirits started to improve.  The walking was easy, the clouds were starting to break up, and we were feeling pretty good about ourselves.  Dropped over the ridge into the Illabot Creek drainage and steadily made our way up the side of the ridge to Pt. 6042.  Here we had a bout of confusion.  The GT map said there should be a lake just below us, but we couldn’t see a thing in the fog and clouds.  Had we somehow managed to end up on the wrong ridge?  Then the clouds broke a bit and we discovered we were about 50 ft above the lake.  Good times.\
\
Made camp in a col on the low, undulating ridge running along the west side of the lake.  Interestingly, the lake does not show up on the USGS map (but it’s really large) and the basin beyond looks to contain glacial ice, even though none is indicated.  We went to bed hoping that the weather would clear up by morning and we’d be able to get some views on our way over Snowking.  You’d think by now we’d have learned not to set expectations that high?\
\
The next morning we hurriedly packed up cramp in a break in the rain and set out up the ridge to Pt. 6995 with basically no visibility.  The wet talus was not fun for walking and became even less fun above 6500 ft where it was slathered in black lichen.  Around 6800’ we encountered a local high point on the ridge without any good way around.  In drier weather with better visibility, we might have continued on, but as it was, we decided to bail.  I think a better route might be to traverse to the right of the ridge, where the snow and talus looks to be pretty low-gradient, but to be fair, this opinion is based only on a few glimpses of snowfield as we were coming back down.  We staggered back into our campsite at 12:30, and pulled out our maps to figure out possible bail routes.  After some half-hearted consideration of going up the south side of Snowking by traveling on glacier not shown on any map, we decided instead to bail by traversing the steep southern flanks of Snowking to reach the relative safety of an unnamed lake around 4700’.  The worst part of the bail was the very beginning where we crossed the roaring outlet of the basin on a snowbridge of questionable stability.  The scene was one of swirling fog, water running and pooling over ice, and desolate glacial debris.  Kind of what hell might look like if it froze over.  Once beyond this impasse it was all sidehilling on talus and heather until we crossed over a ridge below Pt 6100.  Here, for the first time in nearly two days, we had a stunning view of Snowking’s shoulder – barren slabs and hanging snowfields.  We descended to flat meadow around 5200’ where we were pursued by a pack of mosquitos all the way down to the lake.  We circumnavigated the lake in wet, but manageable brush looking for a purported fisherman’s trail, but finding nothing (except for a firepit) resigned ourselves to a miserable bushwhack down the final 2500’ to Illabot Creek.  And that’s when we finally had a ray of luck in this otherwise cursed adventure – after crossing a creek we stumbled upon a very faint tread.  We’d found the fisherman’s trail!  The “trail” clearly sees little use, but we were able to follow nearly to Illabot Creek before losing it at a massive washout.  At some time in the distant past, this was clearly a better maintained route.  A number of huge moss covered blowdowns showed the marks of a cross-cut saw and in other places notches had been hacked in logs to make for an easier crossing.  In hindsight, we probably should have tried to descend the washout and find the trail on the other side, but with Illabot Creek nearly in view, we chose instead to bust down through the brush.  I didn’t know brush could grow so thick.  It was with great relief that we broke out on the banks of Illabot Creek about ½ mile from the road.  After an attempt to bushwhack through the brush lining the creek we decided to abandon our dry feet and waded down the creek, crossing gravel and sand benches with many interesting animal tracks.  As we rounded the final bend and saw the bridge of Illabot Creek Road I could have nearly wept.  Dropping packs, we briskly walked a mile or so back up the road to the Slide Lake trailhead where our car was waiting.  Epic.  Just epic.\
\
Despite my personal epic meter having spent probably a good quarter of the trip pegged heavily in the red, I’m already suffering from trip amnesia and want to go back.  I think something may be wrong with me."
,"Maude and Seven-Fingered Jack 16-17 July '05","Short Version:  \
Stephanie and I went up Mount Maude and Seven-Fingered Jack this weekend.  Great views, good sun and fun times.\
\
Long Version:\
Stephanie and I were looking to get out this weekend.  She’s training for Rainier and it had been more than a week since I’d set foot in the Cascades.  Time to head for the hills!  The forecast was slightly suspicious for Saturday on the westside and so we headed east to nab a couple 9000 footers that had been on the ole tick list.  \
\
Got to the Phelp’s Creek TH at 8:30 and found 22 other cars in the parking lot.   <!-- s:P --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\"" alt=\"":P\"" title=\""Razz\"" /><!-- s:P -->   It seemed that everyone and their mom would be up in Leroy Basin this weekend.  We were a bit concerned as two more cars pulled into the trailhead.  Fortunately, most people who signed the register were destined for Spider Meadows.  We headed in that direction but turned off for the spur trail at Leroy Creek.  For not being maintained, the trail up to the basin is in very good condition.  Made good time going up, grateful that the sun hid in the clouds as headed up the steeply graded trail.  \
\
By 11:30 we arrived in the meadows below Seven-Fingered Jack and Mount Maude.  Apparently a few other people from the TH had the same weekend plan in mind.  With a couple parties in camps and lounging about, it was bit more crowded than what we had become accustomed to in recent trips (no one else around).  Both peaks were still socked in the clouds, so we set up camp and decided to wait out the weather since the blues skies were promising to break through.  Sure enough around 1:30 the spires of 7FJ and the bulk of Maude appeared.  We set out for Maude and while informing another basin visitor about Ice Lakes, ran into Matt Peters and his friend John who were headed off for Mt. Fernow.   \
\
Onward to Maude…the guy interested in Ice Lakes hiked with us up to the saddle which we thought might lead to the lakes.  Turns out he was from Steph’s kick boxing class.  Leroy Basin apparently attracts a smaller circle than we thought.  The south route up to Maude is for the most part a self explanatory stroll up loose scree.  JStern’s song, “I love loose rock,” repeated itself in our heads from 8000 feet onward.  About 500 feet from the summit both of us could feel the effects of going from sea level to almost 9,000 feet.  We kept going and the summit marmot greeted us not long after.   While we had blue skies above us, the mountains to the west, just a ridge over, were still hidden in the clouds.  Buck Mountain tried to break through a few times, but the clouds really wouldn’t blow away until the evening.  Headed down to camp and spent part of the night playing Crazy 8’s with a couple of guys bivying in the meadow neighboring ours.  They had the weekend off from their families and were out to reclaim a few of their past outdoor days by summiting Maude the next morning.\
\
Sunday I work up at 5:30 to clear skies and great morning light.  But we were up there for a leisurely weekend of scrambling so we ended up sleeping in until 7:30.  The night before as we were coming back from Maude we had heard rock fall and shouts of, “ROCK!” from 7FJ.  A party of nine was coming down from the mountain.  Becky, other guides and other scramblers recommend doing the route in small groups to avoid injury from rock fall.  This was evidence to support their recommendations.  So Sunday morning Steph sussed out what other parties camped in the meadow were up to.  Not wanting to be near their inevitable rock fall or vice versa, we left camp a little before 9:00.  Headed SE on the trail toward Maude, we turned off trail at a spot that looked promising to gently ascend to 7FJ’s 7800 foot bench; traveling through open meadows and large loose rocks.  Traversed through some more loose rock and were at the bench.  From the snow fields we followed a boot track and cairns up to the gully, through more loose rock.  By this point in the weekend, we were tired of loose rock and went up the gully enjoying the opportunity to grab on to some nice, solid class 3 rock.  From the gully, we went another 500 feet or so up to the summit.  Made it there by 11:30 and as we stood on the top we could see someone on the top of Fernow and two people on the top of Maude.  Quite the popular area!  Had amazing 360 degree views of the Cascades (Adams, Rainier, Stuart, Glacier, Three Fingers, Baker, etc.) and were able to trace the route of the Buck-Fortress trip we’d done 4th of July weekend.  Buck’s glaciers looked impressive and Clark looked inviting.  After a summit nap in the warm sun (no need for a jacket at 9100 feet this time), we headed down.  Slowly tracing our route back to the snowfield, from there we descended some steep heather slopes to the basin below the bench where by chance we found the climbers path.  We hadn’t been that far off this trail in the morning, but this route was a steeper, shorter way to get back to the meadows.\
\
Back in camp by 2:00, we didn’t stay long as the heat of the day was blazing down and the bugs that had been held at bay by the cooler temps the day before were out in hordes.  Left the meadows around 3:00 and were back at the car by 5:00.  Headed back to Seattle with a stop at the Lake Wenatchee general store (open ‘til 9:00 pm if you ever need to know) in search of popsicles (none there) and post trail refreshments (Fritos and Orange Crush, tasty).  Good times!\

"The-tooth","Big Send!","This past weekend I achieved my summer alpine climbing objective, by sending The Tooth South Face (5.2).  We climbed it on Sunday, and since the weather was awesome we didn't start until 3:00 in the afternoon to try to avoid the crowds.  This tactic worked well, as the last party was just descending as we got to the base, and we had the route and summit to ourselves.  It was pretty fun, I climbed it with my girlfriend and her sister who is visiting.  The \""climbing\"" was pretty casual but fun, we all climbed it in our running shoes and didn't place any protection except for belays.  The last little steep bit at the end was fun, with the super postive giant flakes.  The only downside was the mosquitos, which were the worst I have experienced in Washington, maybe they breed in source lake or something."
"Mount-rainier","Rainier - Kautz Glacier","Stephen, Tim, and I had a perfect trip up Rainier. Our first day was spent in the fog until about 330pm, which kept us cool on the approach. Our friend Katie graciously told us about a fixed line that saved us a lot of work to get to the start of the climb. The chute is now composed of ice in the 2 steepest sections, which we simul-climbed in the dark using ice screws and pickets. We made slow and steady progress from there to the summit, where we found about 40 people lounging around and feeling jubilant. Getting down the chute was challenging and we ended up leaving some gear so we could get down more quickly as rocks and ice continually fell off of the cliffs around us and shot down the chute. It took us about 8 hours from the car to high camp, 8 hours to the summit, 4 hours back down to camp, and another 4 hours to make it back to the car.

,"fixed line","The fixed line is at about 11,200 feet on the Wapowety Cleaver.  The line is connected to a bunch of cord and webbing wrapped around rocks, and is only about 10 feet long.  It allows one to rapp/downclimb a short rock section to a snowslope that leads to the base of the Kautz Glacier chute and bypass the rte above Camp Hazard.  The last photo on my webpage slideshow has the location marked with a waypoint."
"Sloan-peak","Sloan Peak 7.17.05","Ben Long, Justin Evans and I climbed Sloan Peak last Sunday via the Corkscrew Route. \
\
After meeting up, driving to the Sloan Peak Trailhead, and getting the gear sorted we set off around 7:50am only to find the much-ballyhooed ½ mile of river crossings to be rather straightforward (at least on the ascent). As others have said, this approach would not be fun if there had been a hint of rain during the previous week. At some points, the scrubby Hemlocks get so thick they completely obscure the trail and one’s lower body–not fun when wet. Luckily our approach was dry and we made great time up to the foot of the glacier, arriving around noon. \
\
From our vantage, the glacier didn’t look all that bad. We followed tracks made by the two parties ahead of us–both of which had failed to successfully traverse the glacier and make the summit, one citing lack of crampons and hard early morning snow and the other unwilling to cross the cracks sans rope. We brought both of these items and gladly trudged onwards, until we got to the bergschrund. We decided to try an end run, which turned out for the best. To navigate the middle of the glacier, we had to drop some elevation before heading uphill and daintily crossing a few thin snow bridges. After negotiating the bergschrund, we traversed as quickly as possible under the E face and I swore at myself for not bringing a helmet. The glacier is definitely the crux of the route and it probably will not be navigable in a few weeks (or days). After the glacier, the rest of the ascent was cake. \
\
On the way down, the glacier went much quicker. We did, however, spend about ½ an hour getting lost in the dreaded marsh that had been so painless on the ascent. What I learned: try to hurry when caught on broken up glaciers late in the day, but don’t rush on  poorly marked paths through marshy lowlands.   \

"Mount-baker","&quot;Did you summit?&quot; (Coleman Headwall attempt)","I prefer my mountain adventures to have relative solitude.  Such was not the case on our hike in, with dozens of hikers and climbers on the trail, and huge camps on the moraine and by the Buttes.  But it didn't matter.  We were in a good mood.  A group of six Mounties offered to let us pass.  We declined, saying that we were going to take a food/water break and didn't want to play the leapfrog game, and we're not in a hurry -- but if we caught up to them again, we'd take them up on their offer.  The weather forecast was right on.  The clouds lifted off the mountain in the early afternoon, and by evening, they were clearing up in the valleys.  \
\
The hike out was different.  I now had to buy a new camera.  We didn't complete our route.  It was hot, and we wanted to go home now.  The first question came, to be repeated many times: \""Did you summit?\""  \""No.\""  Sometimes they'd ask why or they'd wonder if they'd suffer a similar fate.  Sometimes we'd tell them that we attempted the Headwall, not the Cat-Dog route.  One party asked us if we turned around because we didn't bring enough pro.  We explained that it was more like, there wasn't anywhere solid to put in pro.  We finally just got into the pattern of just saying \""No, but the C-D is in great shape,\"" and moving on.  We didn't want to be, \""We're badasses and we attempted the EXTREME headwall and check out our huge silver belt buckles.  Our dicks aren't small, we swear!\""  Finally at the car, \""Did you summit?\""  \""No.\""  \""Did you almost summit?\"" \""We came back alive.\""  \""Well, I suppose that's a good thing.\""\
\
I had last been high on Baker a few years ago when I did the North Ridge with Jule in late June in a better snow year.  Aaron had last been high on Baker a few years ago when he did the C-D route in September.  As we approached our high camp, we noted that glaciers in May and September are nice (skiiable or dry), but they suck in July.  That would be the common theme of the trip.  Instead of heading up to the Black Buttes, we found a line aiming more or less straight for the Roman Nose.  I shouldn't really call it a line though -- it was quite the zigzag, having to end-run half a dozen crevasses and cross several more snowbridges.  Camp was higher than expected -- we pushed all the way up to 7800.  It had been over a year since either of us had been on glaciers of this scale.  We set up camp, the UWCC's new ID MK3.\

\
We had plenty of time to cook dinner, prep for the morning, etc., and we were in bed by 8 PM.  It's a sweet tent -- larger than the Bibler (home of the Kunz sandwich), and it has two doors, a main/cook door and a back/pee door.  I peeked out of the tent around sunset, but it wasn't the same without my trusty camera.  3 AM the alarm went off.  The skies we're far from black, but a headlamp was appreciated for dextrous skills.  The lights of Bellingham and Vancouver polluted the sky, nearly drowning out what looked to be a faint green aurora.  I had wanted to be moving by 3:30.  We had our harnesses and rope all rigged up, and we ate cold breakfasts.  So much for the perfect plan.  I needed to take a shit, and then I lost my bluebag (I placed it for safe-keeping under my pack).  On top of that, I put my crampons on before my harness (it's faster for me to redo the crampons as opposed to redoing the leg loops).  When we walked out of camp, I didn't look at my watch.  I didn't want to know.  All I knew was I slowed us down.  \
\
As we headed out of camp, we were greeted by an unexpected sound.  Icefall.  We had heard several avalanches the day before coming down the cliffs to the right of the North Ridge.  That's expected -- it's the afternoon.  But icefall before dawn?  That didn't bode well with me.  When I first heard it, my eyes shifted immediately to the headwall.  I didn't see anything, and the noise sounded like it was from the right of the nose.  Well, we'll still give the route a try.  Route-finding past the Nose to the base of the route was a little tricky.  We had weave past several crevasses and cross a thin snowbridge.  But we were finally at the base.  We knew what the route looked like from afar, and from below, we could see ice cliffs looming above us.  It looked like once we passed the cliffs, we'd be home-free.  A snow ramp would take us to the upper snowfields, and we'd have to skirt far left of the bergshrunds, but otherwise no big deal.  \
\
We climbed up hard snow for a few hundred feet until I was able to set a belay in solid ice.  Aaron took the first lead, climbing up the ice until he set a belay with about 30 feet of rope to go.  Time is relative between climber and belayer.  It always seems like forever, dodging/bracing for ice and feeding out rope.  Why is he taking so long to put in that screw?  Why did he stop there?  Couldn't he have topped out within the next 30 feet?  Regardless of how Aaron performed objectively, a little light went off in my head that it feels like he's not performing with the speed and confidence that I know he's capable of.  Soon the rope went tight to me, and I climbed quickly up to Aaron,  going dagger instead of swinging and trying to reuse his placements -- on lead, I'd swing overhead, but in this case, I'd take advantage of the toprope.  \
\
Then it was my lead.  The ice was pretty good -- not too much dinnerplating -- though I'm sure Aaron was having as much fun belaying as I was.  The ice steepened, and the 30 feet that I thought would take me to the crest of the cliff turned out to be more like 100 feet.  I crested, placed a screw, and turned to my right, where I climbed a little higher on the ice fin.  To my left, in between myself and the next ice cliff, were hanging snow blocks about 20 feet wide.  The snow was soft, and I felt that if they gave way, I'd get sucked down with them, getting crushed under tons of snow.  To my right was a gap in the snow and ice.  It was passable with a bouldery move on the ice fin, but further ahead, I would still have to cross those accursed snow blocks.  As I pondered the universe, Aaron shouted up asking what was taking so long.  Clearly, he was on belayer time and I was on climber time.  We were both hearing moaning and creaking in the glacier beneath us, which wasn't exactly reassuring.  Lacking the economy-size alkaseltzer to cure the headwall's indigestion, I made the call.  \

Semi-accurate sketch of what I saw when I turned around.\
\
I downclimbed to my last screw.  We were aborting.  Good thing I had brought the coathanger.  After some monkeying around and two V-threads, we got to terrain that we were comfortable downclimbing unroped.  We were obviously disappointed with the outcome, but we were safe.  One thing I really like about climbing with Aaron is we're a team.  We feel responsible for each other, and we do things for the good of the team.  He never once did question my decision to turn around, nor demand that he be brought up to see it for himself.  We didn't blame either of us for the failure.  We trod back to camp as the sun slowly spread its light to the north slopes of the mountain.  As we packed up camp, noting the climbers gaining the North Ridge from the right-hand start.  The time was 9:30; Jule and I had been at that same position at 6:30.  Not our style -- whether it's for safety reasons (obj hazards) or aesthetic reasons (soft snow sucks, sunrise on the ridge rules), I wouldn't want to be where they were when they were, but that's their call.  \
\
We really didn't give a damn about slogging up the C-D in mush, so we went down to the lower Coleman and TRed some seracs for a little while.  We hiked down, myself at least, a little morose, but we cheerily talked about a variety of stuff -- other routes, the climbing partnership and the importance of teamwork, plans for next year.  Selective memory is a bizarre thing.  Now this is what I remember about the trip -- having a great time with a great partner, despite the fact that we bailed and my camera died.  The summit questions seem totally inconsequential.  I'm already thinking of what trip to do next, and Aaron's on my speeddial of who to invite.\

,"TR: Eldorado, Austera, Klawatti - 7/19-20/2005","Eldorado Ice Cap\
\
Story: \
\
We did the Eldorado Ice Cap traverse to Austera Peak camping at Klawatti Col and climbing Eldorado on the way. I also climbed the southwest buttress of Klawatti Peak. \
[img:3ltgc2bv]http&#58;//www&#46;cascadeclimbers&#46;com/plab/data/503/3820DSCN05220001&#46;JPG[/img:3ltgc2bv]\
\
Long Story: \
\
We set out from the parking lot at 9am under clear skies which made me want to get up into the alpine as fast as possible! The approach was steep and long, but not too bad the second time around. We made good headway and arrived at the base of the east ridge of Eldorado at 2 pm. Very few crevasses on either the Eldorado Glacier or Inspiration Glacier to this point. We ascended the Eldorado ridge under brilliant blue skies finally topping out at the famous knife edge. Tracks and steps from the previous days ended at the top of the snowridge, but I continued and kicked steps all the way to the rock outcropping on the west side of the snow arête. The views were marvelous and we took time to take photos of the summit ridge and views. \
\
After descending Eldorado, we continued on the Inspiration Glacier, traversing at around 7800 feet to Klawatti Col. There were a couple crevasses in one section to navigate thru, which can be bypassed either above or below, but pretty straightforward. Arriving at Klawatti Col at 5:30 pm, we set up camp quickly on the snow as the shade from nearby towers was approaching. With the shade came plummeting temps and a cold wind sending us into the sleeping bags. I came out of the tent for a great sunset with awesome alpenglow on the summit ridge of Eldorado and a full moon rising over Forbidden. \
\
We got out of the tent to see the sunrise under clear and cold conditions. The light on Eldorado was great. We set out for Austera-Klawatti col at about 6 am. The frozen snow made for great cramponing conditions. The moat crossing at Austera-Klawatti col was not too bad although we found an easier route on the return trip that was not obvious from the Westside of the col. The walk from the col to the top of Austera was fast and soon we were peering down at the expanse of the totally awesome McAllister Glacier and its twin ice falls. I continued to the true summit of Austera which was a 10 minute excursion thanks to the beta from Klenke on summitpost. We rested on the summit and watched the lighting change. \
[img:3ltgc2bv]http&#58;//www&#46;cascadeclimbers&#46;com/plab/data/509/3820AusteraMe0001&#46;JPG[/img:3ltgc2bv]\
\
We made it back to camp at 11 am after a leisurely walk across the Klawatti Glacier. From camp, I ascended the southwest buttress of Klawatti. The hardest part was the first 100 feet of getting on to the buttress. Afterwards, the climbing was class 4, then class 3, and finally class 2 for the last couple hundred feet. The roundtrip up Klawatti was less than an hour. \
 \
Back at camp, we rested in the warm sunshine for a bit and then departed camp just after 1 pm, making it back to the car at 5:20. The view from the top of Austera is well worth the effort to get there - some of the best scenery I have seen in the cascades and endless photography opportunities. Hauling gear up the approach paid off with a fabulous sunrise and sunset.\

From here on with the exception of one pitch the climbing is not as good.  Kinda of reminds me of liberty crack in that respect.  The first 4 pitches are awesome, then the climbing kinda breaks down with the expection of one cool pitch higher up.  Who ever gets the second pitch is going to get the reminder of the 5.10- pitches.  Suppose thats cool though because I am clearly the fattest memeber of the IMA staff and therefore shouldn't have to lead that many \""hard\"" pitches.  We skipped the wildcat crack topout and traversed to a gulley which had a snow patch because us fatass get thirsty.\

Cheers to Aaron, Ben, and Brian for a great weekend!  If you read Gemini's TR on his GP attempt from a month ago, the mountain they were on and the mountain we were on were for all practical purposes, different mountains.  It felt that all the stars aligned for this trip -- the gear we packed, the conditions we encountered, our group dynamics, our physical abilities relative to each other, our split times versus my expectations -- I'm not sure how it could have been made more perfect.  Well, I guess there could have been an aurora overnight, we could have been camping at a hotspring, and the Swedish Bikini Team could have greeted us on top.  <!-- s:wink: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\"" alt=\"":wink:\"" title=\""Wink\"" /><!-- s:wink: -->\

,"TR: Northern Pickets - Whatcom/Challenger/Luna 7/24-28/2005","Northern Pickets: Hannegan Pass to Big Beaver Ross Lake\
\
Short Story: \
\
Started at Hannegan Pass Sunday night and ended at Big Beaver Landing Ross Lake Thursday afternoon, basically crossing the park. We entered the Pickets via climbing Whatcom Peak. We climbed Challenger/Luna and traversed the Luna Cirque. Amazing scenery and adventure!\
\
See more pictures in my gallery [url:3i9ue151]http&#58;//www&#46;cascadeclimbers&#46;com/plab/showgallery&#46;php?cat=500&ppuser=3820[/url:3i9ue151]\
\
Long Story: \
\
The partnership of last weeks Eldorado Ice Cap trip continued into the Northern Pickets. The car shuttle took awhile to set-up, but in retrospect I think it was worth it. After we finished work on Sunday, we set out finally arriving at the Hannegan trailhead at 10 pm. We made it to Hannegan Pass under a beautiful star-filled sky with headlamps at 11:30 pm. \
\
Day 1: An early wake up to climb Hannegan Peak for some views. It was nice with a great display of wildflowers up there. We got back to camp and were off down to the Chilliwack River at 8 am. The trail here was great and nicely downhill so we made great time to the cable car. The cable car wasn’t really needed, but we did it anyways for fun. Brush Creek is aptly named right now as there is copious brush to deal with. A small section of washed out trail is easy to navigate through. Finally at Whatcom Pass, we continued up the steep trail to Tapto/Middle Lakes. We first surveyed Middle Lakes, but decided that Tapto fit the bill. A glorious afternoon of exploring around the lakes and alp slopes above concluded with a great sunset. \

  \
Day 2: Sunrise provided awesome reflections in the lakes, but we knew we had a long day ahead so we packed up and left at 7:30 am. Whatcom Arm and Peak took longer than planned, but we finally made the summit and continued down the ridge to meet the snow. The snow patch from Whatcom to Perfect Pass was one spot that allowed for quick progress. From Perfect Pass down to the glacier, we had to downclimb some slabs that were manageable. Once on the Challenger Glacier, we made good progress once again traversing the Challenger Glacier with few crevasses on the route (although many gaping ones above and below) finally arriving at the eastern shoulder of the mountain. The walk from here to the summit block was straightforward with no bergshrund problem. The 40 foot rock block was a fun bit of rock climbing. From the summit, we made it to the rocks at the foot of the mountain in a half hour. It was nice to have sun here for another few hours to rest and dry things out. \

\
Day 3: Departing at 8:30 am. We traversed the eastern section of the Challenger Glacier and then entered Luna Cirque. At first the going was fast traversing heather and wildflower meadows with stupendous views all around. Then there were innumerable streams to cross, loose boulder fields, more loose boulder fields, mega-flies (with stinging bites) and then the mucky glacier above Lousy Lake, another aptly named feature. Refusing to descend all the way to Lousy, we found a reasonable route up a stream in the moraine which put us near Luna Lake. Luna Lake to Luna high pass was a fun route with boulder fields, granite slabs, heather, and finally snowfields, arriving at the pass just before 5 pm. \

Day 4: We knew Luna Peak was one objective we would wake up for. I got up at 4:45 and set out at 5 am. I reached the summit at 5:30 as the colors of the sky were advancing from the east. The next two hours on the summit of Luna seemed like they past in a flash - a truly amazing morning. I was happy to have cell phone reception at the summit to organize a boat pick up at Beaver Landing. Quick work back to our camp at Luna High pass, packing up, and we were off at 8:30 am. The traverse from Luna High pass to the gully heading down to Access Creek was awesome with wildflowers and the Southern Pickets always in sight. Once we descended the ridge, the grunt work began. We stopped at the head of the valley to fill up on water, but flies prevented us from resting too long. The bushwhacking thru groves of old-growth slide alder sucked, but I disliked the devils club further down even more. Big Beaver River was a pleasant sight to see and we didn’t even bother looking for a log, instead wading right thru to the other side. Laying on the trail on the other side, we were immediately covered by a swarm of flies. The hand I was using to swat the flies was covered in flies! Suffice to say, we were outta there! The walk down the Big Beaver Trail went by really fast despite the blisters on the bottom of my feet. We made it to the boat dock at 4:15 pm with plenty of time to chill for the water taxi that arrived at 6 pm. \

\
The Northern Pickets were a great adventure. It seems like the mountains first want to try and keep you out, and once you’re in, they make it hard to get out! It’s basically impossible to accurately describe the highs and lows of the Northern Pickets, but I think the highs definitely win out once you can start to reflect on the boat dock at Ross Lake! My partner for this trip was totally awesome. While our judgment and skills were tested in the beginning, we prevailed resulting in a stronger partnership and friendship. \

"Mount-shuksan","Shuksan: the perfect weather window","Shuksan: the perfect weather window

I grew up in Bellingham and have stared at Mt. Shuksan my entire life, always wondering how anyone could climb such a rugged and complex mountain. When I began climbing, I attempted it right away via the Sulphide glacier, but failed due to bad weather and the slowness of my group, a Seattle Mountaineers party of 12. My second attempt, with a fast Everett Mountaineers party, was via the Fisher Chimneys route. We camped at the top of the Chimneys in beautiful weather, but awoke to a howling blizzard and down-climbed the 4th class gullies in the rain. After that, I swore I'd never a) go on a big Mountaineers climb again, and b) never go on Shuksan again unless the weather forecast was perfect. 

Shuksan Sulphide Glacier FAIL. June 2006.

Shuksan Fisher Chimneys semi-FAIL (still completed much of the route and considered it a good day in the mtns). July 2007. 
[img:24bm1ga4]http&#58;//farm2&#46;static&#46;flickr&#46;com/1235/957737498_a6e724b1eb_m&#46;jpg[/img:24bm1ga4]

Well, I have kept my first resolution, only climbing in groups of 2-4. But this time I broke the second resolution: the weather was very iffy for this climb. When Jon and I picked the Sulphide Glacier as our objective, we originally planned to bring skis. However, our skis were in poor shape after a few spring tours, and we suspected that the cloudy weather would yield concrete sun-cupped mank, rather than beautiful spring corn. We didn't want to navigate Fisher Chimneys in the rain, and the North Face was out due to my fear of steep snow (exacerbated by seeing a few nearly fatal accidents on snow, one just last season). 

It rained the entire first day, but we hoped that the weather would break for us the following morning. We departed from the car at 4 PM on Wednesday. The approach trail was beautiful, lush and full of wildlife. Jon serenaded me with various self-composed ditties. We stopped to admire a single thread of spider web that spanned 20 feet!  
[img:24bm1ga4]http&#58;//farm4&#46;static&#46;flickr&#46;com/3580/3641724266_bae8ccd31a&#46;jpg[/img:24bm1ga4]

After a few miles of trail, we bushwhacked through some clear-cut, following helpful pink tape. We followed Shannon ridge to a notch, and then traversed  beneath some cliffbands that showed evidence of recent avalanches. There were some refrigerator-sized blocks!  We passed two other parties on our way to camp, and the clouds began to break as we set up our tent at 6,000 feet. 
[img:24bm1ga4]http&#58;//farm4&#46;static&#46;flickr&#46;com/3577/3641725520_76df992cda&#46;jpg[/img:24bm1ga4]

We reached camp around 7:30, set up the tent, made dinner, and melted water. I packed the food this time, and unthinkingly packed for two people with smaller Lisa-sized appetites. Jon was horrified when he saw the small hunk of cheese, the seven energy bars, bag of Triscuits, ziplock half full of Swedish fish, and the single package of tortillas.  &quot;We're going to starve!&quot; he exclaimed. I raised an eyebrow when I went to light the stove and noticed that Jon had not added to the fuel canister since our last trip, meaning that it was only 1/3 full. &quot;Jon, what if we can't melt enough water?&quot; 

My efficient water melting/filtering system!
[img:24bm1ga4]http&#58;//farm4&#46;static&#46;flickr&#46;com/3370/3641725918_63c911575e_b&#46;jpg[/img:24bm1ga4]

It turned out that we brought exactly what we needed for this trip. Our packs were very light, and felt like daypacks. Couldn't have been more than 25-30 lb, which is a BIG improvement over how I used to pack for glacier trips like this. I became interested in the statistics of the trip, given the recent discussions on how to save weight. 

Water: we consumed 1.5 liters of water each on the approach and had enough left for dinner and starting the snow-melting process. We melted and filtered 7 more liters at camp, for breakfast and summit day. 

Food for 2: 12 whole wheat tortillas, 4 oz cheese, 1 bell pepper, 1/2 box Triscuits, ziplock of Swedish fish, 2 Pemmican bars, 6 Nature Valley bars, 4 servings of instant cheesy mashed potatoes, 1 vacuum-sealed chicken breast, granola with powdered milk and craisins added, 2 tea bags for morning caffeine. Total: about 7000 calories for the two of us to share. Jon ate about 60% of the food. We ate the last of it on the hike out, and were hungry as we drove home. 

gear: 8 oz alpine harnesses, 30m/8mm rope, REI half dome tent (not the best, but it's what I've got! I'd like a MegaMid or something similar), 1 sleeping bag (didn't work as well as we'd hoped - we're going to try to make a &quot;sleeping quilt&quot;), 2 small foam sleeping pads, Whisperlite stove, titanium pot, 2 runners, 2 pickets, poles, axes, light packs, 2 locking biners, 2 pulleys, prusiks, crampons, shell jackets, down jackets, light gloves, soft shell pants, small 1st aid kit, PLB. 

&quot;I want more crackers!&quot;
[img:24bm1ga4]http&#58;//farm4&#46;static&#46;flickr&#46;com/3396/3641744894_c483b1a09b&#46;jpg[/img:24bm1ga4]

First light was at 4:30 and we woke naturally. Clear skies awaited us! We were above the clouds. We left camp at 5:30.
[img:24bm1ga4]http&#58;//farm3&#46;static&#46;flickr&#46;com/2476/3641728054_001c4e4b01&#46;jpg[/img:24bm1ga4]

We saw the other parties far ahead of us.  Our competitive streaks came out, and we booked it up the Sulphide glacier. We didn't want to be behind large groups in the summit pyramid. 
[img:24bm1ga4]http&#58;//farm4&#46;static&#46;flickr&#46;com/3336/3640920231_f64ca5afd5_b&#46;jpg[/img:24bm1ga4]

We flew by all the other parties, reaching the base of the summit pyramid in less than 2 hours, with no breaks. The summit pyramid's central gully was partially melted out. From a distance it appears very steep! A good family friend of mine skied it a couple of weeks ago. Crazy!
Views opened up to reveal the tops of many North Cascades peaks. We saw Sloan, Glacier Peak, and others. Baker was looking good. 
[img:24bm1ga4]http&#58;//farm3&#46;static&#46;flickr&#46;com/2466/3641735364_4afdb66e4f&#46;jpg[/img:24bm1ga4]

Up close, the summit pyramid is much more inviting, though since the gully was melting out it made things more interesting. We scrambled up it, simulclimbing with pickets for a short stretch when the transitions between snow and rock got tricky. The snow was brittle, and since it was melting out by the rocks, we punched through a few times. In the early morning, some of the rocks were covered in verglas. Overall, though, going up it was quick and straightforward. Looking down:
[img:24bm1ga4]http&#58;//farm4&#46;static&#46;flickr&#46;com/3649/3641737806_eb5c4d2127&#46;jpg[/img:24bm1ga4]

Then, at 8:45 AM, we reached the summit, elevation 9131! It was bright up there. 
[img:24bm1ga4]http&#58;//farm4&#46;static&#46;flickr&#46;com/3545/3640933685_e0d2d4888a&#46;jpg[/img:24bm1ga4]

The party of 8, who turned out to be an AAI alpinism course, arrived and took this photo for us. They were nice people and a lot of fun. Sounds like a really good course that they take. The other party, a group of 3, turned around at the base of the summit pyramid.
[img:24bm1ga4]http&#58;//farm4&#46;static&#46;flickr&#46;com/3569/3641743990_c826d0ac3c&#46;jpg[/img:24bm1ga4]

After lounging on the summit for an hour, we down-climbed. Jon went first and then waited, out of the line of fire, while I followed. There is a fair amount of loose rock in the gully, and chunks of snow were also raining down as the temperatures warmed and things turned to mush. Soloing down a few pitches of 50 degree snow was good for my mental toughness; I don't really like doing that, and felt nervous a few times when the steps collapsed underneath my feet. But the ice axe placements were generally good and I stayed focused and relatively relaxed. We reached some rap anchors and made 2 short rappels to the bottom. I was glad to be done with that part of the descent, but it was a good warmup climb for me to work on my head game. Jon down-climbing 4th class rock in crampons:
[img:24bm1ga4]http&#58;//farm4&#46;static&#46;flickr&#46;com/3646/3640953561_0fe4a217c8&#46;jpg[/img:24bm1ga4]

The MOMENT we reached the base of the pyramid, clouds closed in! We got a little disoriented in the whiteout, so we went down a ways and stopped on some rocks for a lunch break. When the clouds cleared again for a moment, we saw this awesome ice cliff and the summit pyramid. Shuksan has such a beautiful landscape!
[img:24bm1ga4]http&#58;//farm4&#46;static&#46;flickr&#46;com/3546/3641763894_dd37ef1b4e&#46;jpg[/img:24bm1ga4]

We ran down the Sulphide and followed the boot track back to camp. It started raining the minute we got there, so we got into the tent and napped for an hour while it cleared. 
[img:24bm1ga4]http&#58;//farm4&#46;static&#46;flickr&#46;com/3613/3641765860_1e3d46568b&#46;jpg[/img:24bm1ga4]

Then we hiked down to the car, which took 2 hours. It was a beautiful hike out, with layered clouds and glimpses of Baker. This was a lovely, enjoyable climb with about 6700 feet of elevation gain, a lot of variety, a spectacular setting, and a satisfying summit. It was the perfect warm-up for summer and we both feel like we're in great shape for the season.  Definitely recommended!

"Exfoliation-dome","Jacob's Ladder on Exfoliation Dome","Climbed Jacob's Ladder on Exfoliation dome on saturday.  This route is continuously challenging, but very doable if you are a 5.10 climber and don't mind frenching the crux section of the 4th pitch.  This is an awesome climb.  It was reminiscent of many classic crag climbs I have been on, but harder than most I have done.  The climbing is steeper than the few Darrington moderates I have been on, but also more interesting.  The pitches are each very unique and the position on the wall is really incredible.  It is exciting, but well protected where you need it.  I climbed it with Matt Perkins, the route's developer, but the topo on his site seems like it should be totally sufficient.  If the forecast is hot, you can get an early start and spend most of the morning in the shade.\

,"TR: Tank Lakes - 8/4-5/2005","Yea, I know this isn't really a climb, but I got some nice photos and it was fun. \
\
I had under 24 hours off of work. I finished up Thursday at 1:30 pm and started Friday at 1 pm. I decided to go for a quick solo trip to Tank Lakes in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness above Necklace Valley. \
\
[img:2mvfzqm1]http&#58;//www&#46;cascadeclimbers&#46;com/plab/data/509/3820DSCN11220001&#46;JPG[/img:2mvfzqm1]\

\
I left the parking lot just after 3:30 pm. The first 5 miles are relatively flat and fast. Then, the 2,600 ft of elevation gain in the next 2.2 miles to the entrance of Necklace Valley went slower. From here, about another half mile of trail takes you to the cabin and Emerald Lake. A little further from here and just as you get to Opal lake, I headed up meadowy forest that lead to rock slabs higher up. 1,000 vertical feet (1.5 miles) of off trail hiking and a traverse over slabs and rocks put you atop a beautiful plateau in which Tank Lakes are nestled. I arrived at my sleeping bag spot at 7 pm on flat slabs beside the lake. The remainder of the evening was nice with some great post-sunset color on the cirrus behind Chimney Rock. \

 \
I woke up in the morning for sunrise, ascended point 6263 above the lake, enjoyoed the views some more, and set out for the return trip at 8 am. I made it back to the car at 10:30 am jogging the last couple miles so I could go home and shower/eat before a long shift that started at 1 pm. \
\
Tank Lakes are a pretty sweet place. Snow is definitely hard to come by in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. All snow melt was finished in the Tank Lakes area and Mount Hinman looked very dry to the east. Chimney Rock looks like a cool climb. \
\
Bring Jungle juice. The trail to necklace valley is rocky, rooty, and eroded from Foss River to the first lake.\

"Mount-baker","Mount Baker - Easton Glacier route","Tim and I climbed Easton Glacier route on this past Saturday.  Slept at the trailhead - left the car at 4:30am.  Made slow progress on the approach trail, but sped up on the glacier, reaching the summit at 10am.  \
\
Solid, hard snow conditions until 11am when it softened up drastically, making a plush descent.  Crevasses open in sections for the entire route, but the route is partially flagged.  Don’t be fooled into following the bootpath blindly, though – what was safe earlier this summer is had definitely changed in places!    \
\
I’ll drop some photos when I get them from Tim."
"Mount-rainier","TR: Rainier - Kautz 8/6-7/05","Ben and I climbed the Kautz glacier on rainier this weekend, starting from paradise, carrying over and descending the DC.  This was a great trip; our paces matched well, our packs were not too heavy, our bivy was sunny and warm, there were only two other parties on the route (neither of which we ever saw during the day) and the route was challenging enough to be fun but not scary.\
\
Day 1:\
We left Seattle around 6AM, registered at paradise and by 9:30 were hiking towards the nisqually.  The nisqually crossing is mostly dirt with small ice patches except in the middle which is ice with small dirt patches.  We were a little apprehensive about \""the fan\"" because of reports of loose rock.  However, we found it to be generally solid relatively low angle small talus/streambed all the way to the edge of the wilson glacier.  Climbing the edge of the wilson included two short sections of ice.  A few hours of mostly snow climbing led to scenic bivys with flowing water above 10,500 feet.  We arrived around 3:30, rested, had dinner, enjoyed the views, sunbathed, and ben told bad jokes. We slept out in sleeping bags on top of our packs, I had a bivy sack but didn't use it.  \
\
Day 2:\
Around 3AM a party that had camped 1000 feet down the ridge walked past our camp with headlamps.  We had decided we wanted to be able to see in the ice chutes so we got up at 3:45, packed up, had breakfast and were hiking towards the ice cliff by 4:30.  Staying on the left branch of the climber's path took us to a short drop onto the kautz that we rappelled, bypassing the debris gulley at camp hazard.  We simulclimbed the lower (?30 degree) section of the ice chute and ben led the upper section as one pitch, protecting it with ice screws (pickets were useless here).  We took a route off to the left side of the chute that was slightly steeper but more featured than the center of the chute.  Once past the chute we ascended easy slopes to the summit saddle and then up to columbia crest, arriving at 10:15.  Routefinding on the upper kautz was pretty straightforward but we crossed about a dozen crevasses that were just starting to open up; in a week or two this upper section will take a lot longer.  We had lunch at the summit register, then descended the DC route.  This was definitely the way to go; we left the summit at 10:50 and were back to the car by 3:00.  Neither of us had been on rainier before and we enjoyed the contrast of descending a different route; the DC route currently has much more interesting crevasse/serac fields than the kautz.\
\
Gear:\
Sleeping bags, crampons, two ice tools each  (I had two regular axes which worked ok for following in the upper chute but would have been scary for leading), 4 ice screws, bean and cheese burritos\
\
Booty found:\
Blue sit-pad, banana gu, advil"
"Guye-peak","TR: Improbable Traverse - Guye Peak West Face","Josh Stern and I completed the Improbable Traverse after a slow morning this past Sunday (8/7/05).  The approach, though shitty scree, is quick.  Josh and I simuled the first \""pitches\"" to just below the traverse itself.  \
\
I have to say the lead on the traverse was extremely exhilerating - Josh had similar sentiments!  \
\
For the Cascades, I was impressed with the rock quality and enjoyed the climb thoroughly.  This route seems to have a bit of a bad rep.  I agree it's a bit short, but other than that, it makes a great short day and hosts some sweet moves IMHO.\
\
NOTES:\
- Think about rope drag before jumping on the traverse.  \
- There are two fixed pitons (albeit rusty) on the traverse.  I clipped these bad boys.  Thanks Beckey??\
- We took ~4 hours to do the route.  We could have scrubbed off some time by soloing earlier higher up.  Rope just gets in the way after the traverse.  \
- I suggest establishing some backup communication w/ your partner before getting too far.  I couldn't hear a damn thing with I90 there when Josh was yelling at me.  \
- Turn off your cell ring whilst on the traverse!"
"Bear-mountain","Bear DNB","So I finally got around to climbing the direct north buttress of bear.  For some reason I had the route up on a pedestial.  A 2500ft grade V granite 5.10 buttress deep in the north cascades seemed like the ideal climb to for me.  \
\
Last weekend while sitting around after not being able to find a partner I decided that this weekend would be \""The WEEKEND.\""  I called Scott saturday night, he was planning on climbing with his girlfriend through the weekend.  But He started seeing things my way when I told him it was longer than half dome.  Sunday night I had a maybe out of him.  Monday night after calling him we had plans.\
\
Orginally planned on driving up there friday night  but a tr on cc.com had us conviced we could do the approach in 6 hours.  So we did what all the other 22 year olds do with there friday nights and spent it drinking.\
\
Left Seattle at 8am saturday morning.  After getting stopped at the boarder and a few other shaninians we reached the tr head at 1pm!\
\
We started hiking right away. Soon came to the end of chilliwack lake.\
\
[img:2z2s5do9]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/egratz/photos1/Bear%20DNB/beach&#46;jpg[/img:2z2s5do9]\
\
We hike south along the chilliwack river for 4 hours, losing the trail numerous times and suffering though some bushwacking.  Eventually reached Bear Camp.\
\

\
Then climbed steeply up the ridge for the next 5.5 hours, with one route finding mistake costing us an hour.\
\
We settled in for a bivy at the col.  We decide to bring these lightweight fleece sleeping bags that Scotts had only my sleeping bag was really only a small fleece blanket.  It had never been previously opened.  Thankfully nights were warm so it was that cold, though we both shivered a lttle.  \
\
By 6 the next morning we we hiking down from the col towards the buttress. \

\
After a few sketchy snow crossing, and climbing in out and over the moat  we manged to reached the rock. \

[img:2z2s5do9]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/egratz/photos1/Bear%20DNB/racks%20up&#46;jpg[/img:2z2s5do9]\
\
Scott then led a runout slabby 5.7 pitch towards the diehdral\
[img:2z2s5do9]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/egratz/photos1/Bear%20DNB/pitch1&#46;jpg[/img:2z2s5do9]\
\
We carefully climbed another pitch trying not to knock any lose rock on each other.   This put Scott in a position to tackle the diehdral\
\
[img:2z2s5do9]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/egratz/photos1/Bear%20DNB/Not%20that%20grim&#46;jpg[/img:2z2s5do9]\
\
Its supposed to be the crux at 10b.  There are harder 5.9 pitches on route.  The pitch above it had me questioning the 5.8 rating by Kearny turns out both Nelson and Beckey give this pitch 5.9+.  Call it 5.9.  I linked that pitch with the short 5.8 chimney.  \
\
[img:2z2s5do9]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/egratz/photos1/Bear%20DNB/pitch4&#46;jpg[/img:2z2s5do9]\
\
Scott then linked the 5.8 corner, with the 5.9 traverse with the 5.4 ramp with about 30ft of simul climbing.  While belaying this pitch a rock unbenounce to me came and glanced off the side of my helmet.  Good thing I was wearing my brain bucket.  Did I mention there was a lot of loose rock on this hill.  \
\
So anyway after 4hrs of climbing we were halfway at the snow patch thinking we were going to cruise the route.  A little bit of trouble finding the correct right leaning crack above the snow patch (Beta: its on the left side of the pillar, could have saved 15 minutes knowing this) Scott linked this with the 5.8 blocky face cracks pitch.  I then walked along the ledge east to set a belay at the base of Kearney 5.9 corner fist crack.  This was the best pitch on route and would be a classic at squamish or wherever.  Only us left with this really nastly contrived taste in our mouths because instead of walking around the corner you could just climb striaght up the buttress crest and save yourself a half hour.\
\
Scott belays a top the 5.9 pitch\

The somewhat infamous chimney slash offwidth.  Which We bipassed, Would have been cool to just go up it if we had big enough gear.\

\
Scott tired to link this with Kearneys wandering 5.9 pitch.  Which I must say wanders.  Actually looking through beckey, there is the original Beckey option, the Kearney option, the Burdo option, and the Bebie Westlund option.  I think we did a combo of the burdo kearney, and seriously considering heading up the bebie westlund which beckey says is 10c plus aid.  But I don't really know.  I can tell you from Scotts belay above the fixed pin described in beckey.  I downclimbed right of the crest traversed more right, climbed a 5.9ish lichen covered corner finger crack gained the crest and traversed to the other side of it.  from here I told Scott to try a steep left facing corner Bebie Westlund???  After a bit he found away to climb back on the crest and found Kearneys 10- twin cracks.  From here its a walk to the top.  We wasted an hour maybe more on that one section.  All total 9.5 hours on route.  Descend is straight forward down the ridge with one skecthy rappel.  We managed to make it to bear camp that night at 9:30.  \

Quotes from the weekend\
\
Scott having just returned from runout climbing in tolumne regarding ratings \""Everbody's balls must shiveral up when the get into the mountains\""  \
\
Scott around 8pm saturday night still 2hours from the biby \""The longest I have hiked in the past 5 years is like 1.5 hours\""\
\
All told I had a good time and it was a challenge but the actual route was surpisingly easy its was the rest of the stuff that make it alpine that made it challenging.  Neither the rock or the climbing were as good as I would have liked it is the ambience that makes this climb.  A good one for Scotts first alpine climb but maybe we should have done something in the stuart range with better rock and climbing.  I'm going to have a harder time convincing him next time.\
\
The route could be done in 2 days.  I suppose we could have continued to hike along the river in the dark but sounds really annoying.  I have would need to be 2 hours faster, which could have gotten from elimataning those mistaked or starting earlier."
,"Bench Lake and Mount Bruseth 30-31 July 2005","Well Stephanie, at long last, here’s the trip report I said I’d post two weeks ago.\
\
Short Version:  \
Steph and I went up to Bench Lake and scrambled Mount Bruseth (7,220’) over in the Glacier Peak Wilderness.\
\
Long Version:\
30 July 2005 – In search of a trip that didn’t entail heading to Cole’s Corner, Stephanie and I headed out toward Darrington Saturday morning.  By 9:00 am we were strolling past the Suiattle River and headed to the Downey Creek trailhead.  The bridge to the TH washed out a while back and now one scrambles up a ladder of 2x4s to walk the ~0.3 miles to the original TH. One of the rungs was broken on the ladder, which made things a little sporty (those who care to join Steph and I for beers sometime can see the non-digital pics).  Given that this was a few weeks ago, I hope that by now someone has come by with a new piece of 2x4 and some nails to fix it.\
\
The 6.5 miles of trail is relatively flat and meanders through classic North Cascades old growth forest: mossy floor, scattered huckleberry bushes and giant hemlock and Douglas fir with 6-7 foot DBH.  Large enough that one could fit a kitchen table for four on their stumps.  Met two parties of folks fresh off the Ptarmigan Traverse as we headed up the trail, they’d just come off the Bachelor Creek trail and spoke of perfect weather and crevasses opening up along the route. \
\
After crossing Downey Creek we tried to stay along the stream bed, but numerous log jams were slowing our pace so we headed up hill for our first brush with bush whacking for the weekend.  A classic forge through devil’s club alternated by blue berries (nearly ripe, just a bit tart) led us to a few mirage trails that seemed to peter out as they headed away from the creek.  Took us a bit, but we finally made it to the Goat Creek crossing.  Scurrying across the log quickly to avoid the abundant biting flies we scrambled up the steep and prickly rib up to the blow down labyrinth.  The blow down is a large, cumbersome obstacle, but all the same, kind of fun to wind through.  I’d liken it an organic jungle gym for grown ups.  Stumbling out of the log jam, we soon found what we thought was mirage trail #3.  It actually proved to be the fisherman’s trail up to Bench Lake, which winds through steep open forest, eventually topping out into heather meadows with views of the Buckindy peaks and the very welcome site of the lower lake.\
\
After the hot, dry slog up to the meadows (around 5,000 ft), Steph and I dropped down to the water to take a needed hydration break and toyed with the idea of an afternoon swim.  We decided it’d be better to head on up to Bench Lake and enjoy a dip there.  We followed some tread toward the creek and up through the forest, going across slick, pine-needle covered terrain.  Turns out that’s not really necessary.  As we found out the next afternoon, there is a boot path that goes up to the lake.  Go about 100 feet or so north of the lone boulder and the boot path magically appears.  In any case, it didn’t take us long before we encountered the trail further on and we were soon at Bench Lake and the base of Mount Bruseth.  Which looked like this: <!-- m --><a class=\""postlink\"" href=\""http://www.nwhikers.net/forums/download.php?id=2974\"">http://www.nwhikers.net/forums/download.php?id=2974</a><!-- m -->  We had the basin all to ourselves <!-- s:D --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\"" alt=\"":D\"" title=\""Very Happy\"" /><!-- s:D --> , Bench Lake seems to be one of those places only a few people get back to each summer.\
\
We cooled off in the lake as trout darted through the shallow waters.  Set up camp in a grassy area where some past campers had built a fire pit.   <!-- s:P --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\"" alt=\"":P\"" title=\""Razz\"" /><!-- s:P -->   Enjoyed a gourmet dinner and dessert of oatmeal raspberry bars before falling asleep to the sound of fish jumping in the lake.  \
\
Wanting to avoid the heat of mid-morning and retreat back to the shady forest by afternoon, we left camp at 6:00 am and headed north around the lake toward Bruseth.  At first we planned to go through the trees up to the lower bench, but some unforeseen ledges early in the process proved that the Beckey route would be much easier and more straight forward.  We dropped back down and traversed the lake shore to the talus.  From there, the route entails bounding large boulders and heading up a dry creek bed of mostly stable rocks to another boulder field and then through about 30 feet of dense mountain hemlock, which guard the ridge line.  Popping over the ridge, we had our first views or Lizard Mountain, the Cascade Glacier and Woods Lake.  The lake looked inviting, but scree around its entire perimeter makes Bench a more suitable camping destination.\
\
As we meandered up the SE ridge of heather meadows to the summit block we had views of Glacier Peak to the south.  The walk up was easy class 2.  We were about 30 feet away and 20 feet below the actual summit when we got to a class 3 move.  Soon it was feeling a bit class 4, normally not a problem, but given that on either side of the knife-ridge stretch there was a 150-300 foot drop <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\"" alt=\"":shock:\"" title=\""Shocked\"" /><!-- s:shock: --> , I decided to turn around and head back to Steph.  No need to make it to the summit register that morning.  A pair of rock shoes would probably have done the trick in giving me just a little more grip on the rocks.  Stomachs settled, Steph and I enjoyed a mountain brunch, just below the summit block.  Great views of the Ptarmigan Traverse, Baker, Shuksan and other stellar cast members of the N. Cascades.  \
\
Headed back to the lake a little after 8:30 and grazed on blueberries (just ripe!) on the way down.  Enjoyed another swim and sun warming session as we lazily packed up camp.  The heat and flies were back in full force.  In fact they’d land on us, just after we’d liberally apply various forms of DEET; apparently they didn’t get the MEMO on how they’re supposed to react to bug repellant.  (Some one should make them write a TSA report.)  We said good bye to Bruseth and Bench Lake and headed out on the trail to the steep, pine-needle carpeted path along the rib.  We took our time getting down and winding back through the blow down.  Noticing along the way that someone has placed blaze marks along the trees that are visible while heading down the trail.  After a little back tracking (no blaze marks for a stretch) we came out to the Goat Creek crossing.  Did another devil’s club, salmon berry and other spiny plant encumbered brush bash back to where we left Downey Creek.  Came across some other cool climber girls who had just finished the PT and chatted for a few minutes.  Then Steph and I busted out the long, dry 6.5 miles back to TH.  Made it out by 7:15 and soon we were driving back to Darrington in search of cheeseburgers and milkshakes at the Burger Barn.  FYI, the BB closes at 8:00 on Sundays.  If you get there at 8:01 you’re not likely to encounter another chance for a cheese burger until you get to Denny’s in Arlington.  Just not the same.  Wanting to get back to Seattle sooner than diner style affords, we settled for some much needed grease at Jack in the Box.  Good times, beautiful alpine lake setting and looking forward to going back and making it all the way to the top.\
\
Stats and Notes:\
Round trip: ~20 miles, 6,000 foot gain\
Bush whacking: a little bit of BW purgatory, but good for first time BW route finders\
Lost gear: Steph’s good trekking pole, but it was picked up by the cool climber girls on their way out\
Baked goods: two kinds of raspberry oatmeal bars\
Don Frazier’s report on summitpost.org is spot on for getting up to Bench Lake; Beckey seems to underestimate the scrambling"

I enjoyed using my new cams but I recommend not buying the $30 climbaxe cams because they twist easily when trying to put them in.  The route was fun but I kept getting a lot of rope drag because of blocky, zig zaggy, routes and slinging trees for pro.  So the climbing was kind of intermittent.  We also stopped and let another party go by that started up on our heels and was going just barely faster than us.\
The bear hug was definitely fun and one #4 cam protects the bottom of the bear hug just fine.\
\
\
We downclimbed the whole south arete.\
\
Took us somewhere around 6 hours with plenty of view breaks, waiting to be passed, slow hiking, and some good conversation.\
\
Will add pictures."
,"photo","thanks for the photos justin. To make the shots smaller use something like photoshop etc. to size the photos down to around 4 inches, then save-for-web jpg to make them less memory. That usually works for me. Are those photos of the big overhanging boulder near the small stream. Did you find any other good problems near there?"
"Eldorado-peak","Eldorado NE Face ice extravaganza","Justin Evans and I went out looking for some ice on saturday.  We booked it up the steep trail to the McCallister glacier and then up the left side of the NE face.  We cut right above the schrund and started up the first of three extremely mild pitches of slush over ice.  It was fun anyways and we placed some screws for practice, but Nelson is full of **** about an august ice climb.  But the views, the weather, the laxidasical pace, the lounging on the summit, all well made up for any lack of real ice. We had the climb completely to ourselves until back down in the meadows when the sat. pack mule wanna be's we trudging in.  One day seemed like a much better idea on this climb as the steepness of the trail was murder on the knees on the descent.  Back to the car in a few hours, a big fat elk burger, and we were off to the hairpin turn.\
\
Good times.\

Pictures to come."
"Mount-rainier","Mt Rainier, Kautz Glacier, 8/13-14","Ben Kunz and I climbed that big mountain next to the Paradise Visitor Center and Parking Lot this weekend.  Except for the circling helicopters, current and former UWCC types, and the ten thousand other people we met between the summit and Paradise, we had the place to ourselves.\
\
The rangers were the crux of the route.  We had to dodge them and their wily schemes on several occasions.  First, the guy at climbers' registration convinced us to tack another two grand of vert on to our approach by starting from Comet Falls TH rather than crossing the Nisqually (supposedly hard ice covered in ball bearings), then hiking up the Fan (supposedly instant rockfall death), then traversing the Wilson (which supposedly some people have been belaying due to bare ice).  The check-in guy also insisted that there was no fixed rope at the rappel from above Camp Hazard toward the ice chute.\
\
On the hike up, we were flagged down by a red-bearded ranger and given our first interview.  We like interviews, but prefer to have them after the climb so we can chestbeat whilst drinking beer.  Red was relieved to find out that we weren't another search party intruding on HIS search area.\
\
A few thousand feet higher, two climbing rangers gave us another interview.  The female ranger, named after a soft and pleasantly fragrant French cheese, had just done a patrol of our route the previous day and tried to scare us off with tales of \""really steep\"" ice that \""wouldn't even take a pick... bulletproof... dinnerplating... no penitentes... blah blah blah...\"".  Everything is scarier when you're soloing, I suppose.\
\
And then there were the helicopters, ostensibly [url=http&#58;//www&#46;king5&#46;com/topstories/stories/NW_081505WABmissinghikerSW&#46;76da9bf0&#46;html:2lqx8ylz]looking for \""some doofus\""[/url:2lqx8ylz], as Miss Fromage, in her professional capacity as member of the search party, referred to the lost hiker.\
\
Despite the NPS' obviously coordinated efforts to divert, distract, and delay us, we eventually found a sweet bivy spot and practiced crevasse rescue.  This practice was useful in illustrating how much it would suck to have to haul out your partner on a two-person team.  We agreed not to fall into any crevasses.\
\
(Now there's a big gap in the chronology of the TR, a departure from the usual mode, in which I write at length about food, \""the brotherhood of the rope\"
"Mount-rainier","Kautz Glacier route 8/9 - 8/11","Well, seems this is the popular route of the season, and I understand why.  It was very satisfying for Matt and I, and I had fun on my first technical alpine ice.  It was also my first successful summit of Rainier <!-- s:D --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\"" alt=\"":D\"" title=\""Very Happy\"" /><!-- s:D --> , and we highly enjoyed having the route almost all to ourselves.  Glacier travel is relatively new for me, as are high elevations, so the route took us 2 and a half days.\
We also started at Paradise and crossed the dirty Nisqually, went up the loose fan (not much auditory rockfall heard here), and made our way up the Wilson (where we roped up for the first time), and made camp at around 10,000 feet below camp Hazard.  Wind picked up at about 9 pm and didn't let up until 7 am.  No sleep to speak of.  We got off to a bit of a late start the next morning because of howling wind, and wanting it to be light when we climbed the chute.  We also came accross the short fixed line to the W of Camp Hazard, and used that to lower to the level of the ice chute.  There was a party of 3 above the ice chute when we were starting it.  The climbing on the ice chute was fun and felt good.  We each had one ice tool and an ice axe that was just used for balance if at all.  We started to simul climb, but I was having trouble and feeling a little sketched out by the steep grade.  So Matt lead with ice screws (when needed), and I belayed via a munter.  After my first couple of messy swings, the ice ended up being really nice, and I was sticking my ice tool quite nicely.  The belaying definitly made us fall behind schedule. The next thing that cost us some time, was that above the chute we went W (left) up the upper basin, instead of E up to a saddle, which is where it sounds like most of the TRs went.  Here we ran into a lot of crevasses that had to be walked around, or hopped over.  The scariest one was about 14 feet wide, and the top edge was more like a long serac.  We found a snowbridge type ramp that would take us over it, and with some ice-axe belaying, and quick feet, we negotiated it okay.  Phew.  \
The summit was accomplished later in the evening, where I was quite affected by the altitude (dull headache, wavering steps), and after a 4 minute picture session we hurried down the DC to the first rock outcropping we came to to set up camp.  Matt's GPS read at 12,300 feet, so I prayed my headache wouldnt' get worse, and we set up the tent with a rock in the middle so it wouldn't blow over the cliff.  Thankfully our stove worked long enough in the wind to melt a liter for each of us, and water for lasagne.  Again, the wind was so strong that we didn't get any sleep.  Especially around 3 am when group after group of standard-routers stopped to rest by our tent and talk loudly over the wind.  <!-- s:? --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_confused.gif\"" alt=\"":?\"" title=\""Confused\"" /><!-- s:? --> \
The next morning we enjoyed a quick and needed descent in elevation (even though I lost a contact that morning) to Camp Muir where some friendly folks who had been on guided climbs snagged water for us from the guide service.  Back at the parking lot I unfortunately had to deal with my car who's alarm would trigger when I turned the car on (after many dirty looks from tourist's, we finally figured out how to cancel the alarm, but now my headlight fuses are messed up . . . hmmm)\
All in all a great trip, despite the long second day.  And I finally got up that mountian I've been wanting for the past 2 years.\
(New to the digital world, I will try to get some pictures up.)"
,"TR: Northern Pickets - Early July - Whatcom, Challenger,Luna","So this is super late, but here it is:\
\
Ralph, Jon, Dave and I planned a week long trip into the Pickets in early July with hopes of climbing Whatcom Peak, Mount Challenger, North Buttress of Mount Fury, and North Face of Mount Terror.\
\
On Friday, July 2nd we made our way up the Hannegan Pass trail to the Chilliwack River where we joined the Brush Creek trail to Whatcom Pass.  It drizzled all morning and remained overcast all day long, making the 17 miles a damp start to our trip.\
\
On the second day, we hiked about a half-mile, found a campsite, and slept in the sunshine on the ridge below Whatcom.  This was Jon's recovery day.  We commenced reading The Hobbit.  \
\
The next day, the clouds cleared and the prospects for climbing looked excellent!  Our goal was to climb over Whatcom Peak as the approach to Mount Challenger, and see how far we might get across the Challenger Glacier.  Getting a reasonably early start, we climbed the north ridge of Whatcom up steep snow (40-45 degrees) to a class four scramble up loose rock to the summit.\
\
By noon, we were making our way down the back side of Whatcom to the Challenger Glacier.  We started across the Challenger Glacier, but rain started shortly thereafter.  We bailed and set up a quick camp at Perfect Pass instead of getting ourselves soaked on a slippery glacier crossing!  For two hours, the rain pounded the North Cascades while we ate and read the Hobbit (our loud to each other!) to pass the time!  The rain passed and the sun returned.  \
\
We quickly packed and returned to the glacier in hopes of making the summit that day.  We crossed the Challenger Glacier without incident, dropped our packs and made our way up to the summit rocks.  We summited near nightfall, enjoying the view of the northern Pickets lit in the warm sunset light!\
\
We set up camp and since the sky was filled with stars, I slept outside to give Dave and Ralph more room in the tent.  A sun-filled morning meant an early start across the remainder of the Challenger Glacier where we started a long, annoying traverse into Luna Cirque.  We figured we dropped ~4500 feet from Challenger to Luna Cirque over some pretty hairy terrain.    At one point, we downclimbed an algae section next to a waterfall (read: sketchy moves on wet, slabby terrain – not fun!).\
\
By the time we reached Luna Cirque, it had clouded over and it appeared that we might be in for another afternoon rainstorm.  Not long after we’d setup the tent, it indeed began to rain.  We nestled in the tent, making bets on when it would stop.  It rained for the rest of day and throughout the night and throughout the next day – all the while, the three of us were jammed in the 2 person Bibler tent!  We did our best to enter Standby mode, moving only when really needed and focusing on the words of the Hobbit to escape our current plight!  (With all the rain, the difficult approach and rockfall danger, we bailed on Fury the night previous, hoping to possibly climb Luna if the weather improved.)\
\
Camping at Luna Cirque is truly an amazing experience.  Seracs from the cirque’s hanging glacier steadily peel off and rockfall echoes intermittently.  The sounds create an arena of impressive geological action, but leave the spectator feeling humbled, and frankly, scared! \
The next afternoon, the rain still hadn’t stopped, but we couldn’t take it anymore [boredom, stench, dampness]!  So we emerged from our tent during a short lull in the rain and quickly packed.  We were mostly wet so we figured it wouldn’t matter if we traveled in the rain at this point.  (And it did continue to rain for the remainder of that day!)  \
\
We made our way across the moraine of Luna Cirque, climbed a short snow section to Luna lake and picked our way up to a bench below Luna col.  That evening, we finished the Hobbit and experienced the worst sleep of the trip so far.  It rained most of that night, was the coldest night yet, and we all tossed and turned (which resulted in spastic kicks in the head from time to time).  Thankfully in the morning, the clouds had moved on and the sun shone fresh light on all the dampness!   We were ecstatic to see the sun and feel its warmth on us as we prepared the same breakfast we’d prepared for the last six days!\
\
We strapped on crampons and reached the col in short order.  The spectacular views of the Northern and Southern Pickets rose in front of us, making everything worthwhile!  We climbed the typical scramble route on Luna Peak, which is a crappy climb on loose rock, made particularly sketchy by the wet lichen covering the rock!\
\
On our way down, clouds started to fill the valleys, which made our descent off Luna all the more interesting!  Later during our descent, we ran into grouse and fatty marmots.\
\
The rest of the story, though not at all eventless, brings little to tell!  Dropping the 5000-6000 feet from Luna peak to Big Beaver trail (that eventually hooks up with Ross lake) involved plenty of steep heather traverses, a seemingly endless scree descent, a bloody awful bushwack down Access creek to an unwelcome river ford across the Big Beaver creek (which was flowing very healthily I might add!)!  Basically, it was your typical exit out of the North Cascades – unforgiving!\
\
We managed to get out of the park (in rain) the next morning!\

"Mount-fernow","Fernow","Eric Babson and I climbed Mt Fernow this weekend via the Southwest route. \
\
After battling traffic for over four hours, we set up camp around 6,100’ in Leroy Basin and set the alarm for 4:00am. Underway by 5:00am, the climb to the 7,700’ col west of Seven Fingered Jack took an hour. After looking straight down from the col onto rather steep dirt, we traversed west along the ridge to a slight gap. The descent on classic Entiat range class 3 “rock” led to a snowfield that had long since melted out (i.e.- dirt). After crossing a few rock-studded ice patches, we sidehilled above the Gloomy Glacier’s Moraine, so as to not lose elevation. This was not helpful, as we were crossing sparse scree and gravel over hardpacked dirt. A much more efficient way of crossing the Big Creek Basin is to descend to the moraine, or just above it, and walk on relatively level glacial debris. We arrived at the basin just below the SW gully roughly 2.5 hours after setting out. The gully was straightforward, with solid, water polished rock on the right and Entiat crumble on the left. At the SFJ-Fernow col, we headed up and left to a notch that allowed easy access to ramps across the SE face. The final scramble was straightforward, and we reached the summit at 9:15, 4.25 hours from camp. If you can deal with loose rock, this summit is pretty awesome. If, on the other hand, you’d rather avoid miles of scree and the thrill of  breaking hand and footholds, count this one out.  \

,"boulders","yeah, that boulder was not too deep in the woods by the stream covered with sticks and such. we also went a little deeper and found a huge boulder with 10 or so problems all around it. this is what we worked for the rest of the day.\

"Mount-baker","Some observations on guiding (Baker 8/12-8/14/05)","While teaching a NOLS mountaineering course in the Winds this summer, I was inspired by a fellow instructor to venture into the realm of guiding.  It seemed like a good idea- better pay than NOLS, more flexible schedule, shorter trips, glamor, romance, prestige, and all that great stuff.  I was initially hesitant to leave my role of instructor and take up the role of guide, changing from a teacher to getting people to the top.  I applied to Alpine Ascents International based here in Seattle, and was promptly offered work on Baker.  The expedition manager told me this would be a good introduction to the experience.  Some of my expectations were met, some were exceeded, and while I did encounter a few frustrations it was, on the whole, a rewarding time.\
\
The route was the Easton glacier, and seeing as the other guide (another NOLS instructor) and I had never climbed the mountain before, we would have some fun exploring the volcano.  In the profession this is known as \""aggressive guiding,\"" onsighting routes with clients/students, a practice that is embraced at NOLS but generally avoided by guiding companies.  The difficulties posed by the Easton hardly made it an \""onsight\"" so leading a bunch of newbies up was not a big deal.  \
\
We had nine clients from as far away as Wisconsin and Phoenix and a couple Canucks.  Everyone was fun and I liked all of them, which I was cautioned not to get used to.  The approach hike (in plastic boots  <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\"" alt=\"":shock:\"" title=\""Shocked\"" /><!-- s:shock: --> ) was strenuous for many of the clients, and I wondered what I was getting myself into.  Plastics in the hot dust, 50-pound pack, slow pace, this was not my personal style but I had to remind myself that I was getting paid to do it and this cheered me up.\
\
We pitched our massive 4-season expedition tents on the moraine around 6,400 feet and enjoyed some great views from camp.  I cooked dinner for the whole group:  tortellini with pesto, pine nuts, and parmesan prepared in two 6-liter pots on 4 Whisperlites.  Damn.  It was a fine meal.  No boiling water on the micro canister stove, this was a production of luxurious commercial proportions.\

The second day we taught glacier travel skills and some snow school stuff.  A helicopter buzzed our camp.\

After another massive dinner of couscous and chicken we gave the plan for the summit push.  The moon rose and we went to bed.\

\
At midnight we rose, but didn't actually leave camp until 1:40.  Clients are slow at doing everything.  We moved up the glacier slowly in three rope teams, and were treated to some beautiful views in perfect climbing conditions.\

\
We reached the summit at 9:30.  Later than we had hoped but earlier than the Mountain Madness group that was behind us.  We shared the summit with numerous groups.  It was very crowded up there between the guided groups, the Mounties, and all the private parties.  A dog even summited.\
\
[img:xsbuhrqf]http&#58;//cascadeadventure&#46;com/groupee_files/photo_albums/1/0/6/1061013913/7061013913_767FD3B38F66381CE92F03E5F5603C79&#46;jpg[/img:xsbuhrqf]\
\
We took off at 10, hoping to make a swift descent so we could reach the parking lot at a reasonable hour.  Not so fast:  it took us nearly as long to descend the Roman Wall as it did to climb it.  Patience, Bratton, patience.  We used the Alaskan Long Rope technique to descend in two rope teams.  It sounds cool, but wasn't.  More people on a rope = more time to go down.\
\
[img:xsbuhrqf]http&#58;//cascadeadventure&#46;com/groupee_files/photo_albums/1/0/6/1061013913/3061013913_DCD4CE130F08264B837CB5B36E17DF07&#46;jpg[/img:xsbuhrqf]\
\
Then came the highlight of the trip.  The woman in front of me set her pack down on the snow to remove her jacket.  Her pack started rolling down the mountain, and she freaked out and started running after it.  I reined her in with the rope and watched it bounce into a crevasse.  She was distraught, I was trying not to laugh.  Guess who ended up climbing into the crevasse to pull her pack out?\
\
[img:xsbuhrqf]http&#58;//cascadeadventure&#46;com/groupee_files/photo_albums/1/0/6/1061013913/1161013913_FBF817F385E48AC75469EA7E6925F7DA&#46;jpg[/img:xsbuhrqf]\
\
The rest of the descent went smoothly, but I was a little concerned to see a Mountain Madness team stopped to pull one of their clients out of a crevasse.  Mark had watched her take a header into a 3-foot wide crack, but she made it out okay.  Fun times on the glacier.  We packed up camp and were moving down the moraine by 4.  It was late and we still had a long way to go.\
\
[img:xsbuhrqf]http&#58;//cascadeadventure&#46;com/groupee_files/photo_albums/1/0/6/1061013913/4161013913_6C53246E1972DB9B971037F3DCF6E190&#46;jpg[/img:xsbuhrqf]\
\
The hike down was painful for most folks, but everyone made it out before dark.  Mark was the hero when he pulled a cooler of beer out of his van.  I loaded all the company gear into my truck, said goodbye, and hit the road around 8:30, finally reaching my house at 11.  A 23-hour day with 12 miles of hiking is plenty long, thank you very much.\
\
It was a successful climb.  All the climbers returned safely to the parking lot, everyone summitted, and everyone had a great time.  The skill level and personal organization of the clients made the trip a lot longer than it could have been.  Some people never learned how to put their crampons on by themselves, some were in poor physical shape, and some didn't take good care of themselves.  These were the kinds of frustrations I had, because they are all delays or problems that are easily avoided.  In a sense I felt a bit like a babysitter, but it forced me to concentrate on my patience and help my clients out as best I could.  The trip was too short to delve into instruction in much depth, so there was a lot less leadership for the climbers to assume.  On the other hand, everyone was deeply grateful for the guides' efforts to coach, encourage, and support them.  I felt like everyone appreciated what I was doing and realized that I was there to help them staf safe, enjoy themselves, and achieve their personal goals.  This was undoubtedly the most rewarding part of the trip.  Everyone was there for different reasons, and everyone did succeed in accomplishing what they set out to do, which was much more than just reach the summit.  It was cool to see.  It was a satisfying experience.  Not in the way NOLS is satisfying, but all the same it was a new perspective on mountaineering that I had not seen before.  I think I will stick with it for a little while, and if I am lucky Alpine Ascents will send me to Alaska next summer.\

All photos were taken by client Mat Chacon, the guy on the far left in the summit picture.  Well, I guess he didn't take that one."
,"Wilman's Peak - 8/27/05","Short Version:\
\
Lindsay, Lissa, Ian, and I headed out to Monte Cristo on Saturday to climb Wilman's Peak in Glacier Basin.  Great trip with scrambling that ranges from wonderfully clean rock to dangerously loose scree.\
\
RT Stats: 8 miles by bike, 5-6 miles on foot, ~4000' gain\
\
Long Version:\
\
When Ian said he'd pick me up in a truck on Saturday morning to scramble Wilman's Peak, I didn't expect to see a truck the size of a Ryder moving van show up in front of my house.  But that's what I got.  Which got some interesting looks on the ride out to Barlow.  Departed Barlow around 9:00 on our bikes and made good progress for about a mile under Ian's chain snapped.  But he's super hardcore, so he ran the rest of the way to Monte Cristo.\
\
Up to Glacier Basin at a good pace until we ran into blueberries and huckleberries - grazing always slows you down.  From Glacier Basin we ascended a talus fan to the gap below E. Wilman's Spire.  The talus is significantly more sound sweeping up from climber's right.  Upon reaching the shallow basin beneath E. Wilman's Spire, we followed Beckey's instruction to head east of E. Wilman's Spire until south of the upper notch.  This instruction is incorrect - from the basin, one is supposed to ascend the steep gully between E. Wilman's and the north and south spires.  However, the decision wasn't all bad.\
\
After crossing a nasty bit of loose scree on crumbly rock, we found ourselves on some of the most beautiful class 2-3 climbing I've ever been on.  In the early season this would be a mess from snowmelt, but this time of year the rock is dry, clean, and beautifully solid with none of the portable holds I've come to expect from the Monte Cristos.  After nearly 1000' of this fun, the rock turned back to choss of the worst kind about 200 feet below a saddle.  I headed up a semi-rotten arete, which led into some fairly solid rock, and then a quick scree traverse to the saddle.  As I was traversing the scree, my right foot abruptly blew releasing a hail of pebbles and fist-sized rocks.  Fortunately, both Lindsay and Lissa were out of the major fall line, but the experience was unnerving.\
\
Once we reached the saddle, it was an easy scramble the rest of the way to the summit.  Great views of all peaks near and far.  The summit register indicates this one doesn't get a lot of visitors - about a party or two a year since 1995.  Anyone heading up that way might want to bring along a new register and pencil.\
\
After lounging for a while, we decided to head back down, this time staying on the south face of the ridge which we (correctly) ascertained to be the route described by Beckey.  We reached the notch to the west of E. Wilman's Spire on a neat, easy ledge system and downclimbed the gulley.  The gulley contains a lot of loose rock and the occasional rap sling indicated that not everyone feels comfortable with the downclimb.  Largely without incident, we made it nearly to the bottom of the gulley where we were confronted with a ten foot rock step.  Up-gulley was a mass of rap slings.  Bugger - I hate finding rap slings on scramble routes.  Lindsay opted to head up on some loose rock to climber's left to find an alternate route.  Lissa and I hung around waiting for her and I decided to give downclimbing a try.  Once out on the rock, it actually wasn't that bad and both of us were able to downclimb it without any trouble.  I'd say it's a stiff, semi-exposed class 3 move, but the rock is very solid and the feet and hands are quite good.  I'd say that this is the crux of the downclimb.\
\
Down the talus, back to Monte Cristo, and out to Barlow by bike by 7:30.  Good times, great company, and awesome/miserable scrambling."

The next step is understanding how Eric remained calm all the way up outerspace.  I guess on the plus side you dont have to downclimb that one."
"South-early-winters-spire","SEWS SW Rib","Friday, Matt Elise and I had originally planned on doing a traverse of the liberty bell group (s-&gt;n), but upon reccomendation from some experts on the area, we scrapped those plans and did the SW rib on SEWS.\
This was a great opportunity to try out my new half ropes. I lead the first 3 pitches (through the top of the 5.8 splitter) then Matt took the lead and took us to the top.  The rock was awsome as was the weather making a great day of climbing and a nice first alpine climb for me (for whatever reason, its taken me a long time to finally make it up into the hills).\
The next day we went and cragged at fun rocks in Mazama before returning to Seattle.  I lead a long 5.8 arrete followed by a .10b overhanging route and finally a 30ft-long .10d/.11a route with 2 bolts within 5ft of each other about half-way up.  Then we went to K9 crag where I lead a .10d in bad style (I don't even want to talk about it...) and finished the day by tr'ing a .11d.  The weekend overall left me feeling pretty good about my climbing abilities despite my severe lack of climbing this summer."
,"Spider Meadows","Jim Nelson and I headed out Sunday with hopes to escape the weather on the eastside and get some photography in around the Spider Meadows / Lyman Lake / Dumbell area.  The meadows were smaller than we anticipated, though quite pretty.  The clouds made for some rapidly changing lighting.  We made camp at around 6200' on the way up to Spider Gap with partly cloudy skies overhead.  We took a peek at the Spider \""Glacier\"" -- it's more like Big4 Ice Caves.  In the middle of the night, the skies let loose, and it continued into the morning.  At one point, the sun poked through, and we started packing up camp, only to have it start raining again a few minutes later.  We escaped to under the tarp again.  Finally, around noon, we packed up for good and headed back down.  The cloud level was around 8000 feet, and snow had fallen the night before down to 7500 feet.  The skies cleared up a little bit on the hike out (maybe because we were hiking south), and though it were partly cloudy near Lake Wenatchee, there was heavy rain from Stevens Pass to Goldbar.  The quinessential moment of the trip was when we were waiting out the rain under the tarp, and I picked up the Nalgene of port and asked Jim if he wanted some, which he responded with a consoling, 'Yup.\""  Anyway, it's a beautiful area, and I'll want to return sometime in better weather.  We had a lot of tent-time for a 36-hour Seattle-to-Seattle trip, and it was a pleasure exchanging stories with Jim.  I'll post some pics when I get around to posting pics and a TR from Dragontail Backone and pics from Curtis-Gilbert and Bruseth and Index."
,"Torment Col Wanderings","Yoav, recently repatriated from Tasmania, and I spent a weekend in the North Cascades. Between the Inspiration Glacier and the crags of Forbidden lies a gentle ridge of polished granite and soft meadows perched above the cirque of Moraine Lake. Well provisioned with Lindsay's lembas cakes, we traversed both Boston and Torment Basins. We set up camp at the lowest point on this divide and explored the surrounding knobs. \
\
From the depths of the Cascade river just past the Eldorado trailhead, a faint but inviting track leads upwards through cathedral-like old growth forest into Torment Basin. Although it was indeed where Becky said it would be and perhaps the more direct route, it did not appear well travelled and not even the rangers seemed to know much about it. Curiosity momentarily satisfied about its existence, we instead opted for a traverse across Boston Basin via the more known route.\
\
A well-used track leads to treeline, rough at first but then becoming nice after crossing a chaotic avalanche path. After leaving the track we traversed through some classic alpine greenery, with sweet huckleberries keeping the pace slow. The polished granite of recently deglaciated terrain below Torment was especially interesting to ponder, rivulets cascading from freshly calved ice blocks plunging into shallow pools in the rock.\
\
This is also Ptarmigan Country -- I think that I have seen these little birds near just about every major col over 6500' that I have visited in the North Cascades. A family paid us a visit in the evening as we were setting up camp, remarkably unalarmed for being so low on the food chain. Their camoflage rendered them nearly undetectable until they were within shooting range of the 50mm.\
\
Saturday was a typical summer day, warm and cloudless. By Sunday morning however, there was a distinct change in the air. Lenticulars were building to the west and a strong breeze whipped over the ridge. Bands of broken stratus took on crimson hues over the icecap. The horn of Forbidden could be seen spouting molten fire as clouds swirled past its summit. Nevertheless, the darkest part of the skies held back the rest of the day allowing for an uneventful walk out. Some class 3 slabs and ramps provided enjoyable scrambling on the divide between the two basins but could have been tricky when wet. Passing back through Darrington, gusty winds whipped up the leaves and clouds of dust and then the wall of rain finally hit.\
\
In the end, a nice return to the mountains after a summer of work, and I look forward to returning for the complete Forbidden circuit!\

"index","More Index","Went this morning with Jesse H from cc.com.\
\
We warmed up on Aries and Libra Crack.\
\
We then headed over to Thin Fingers, which Jesse sent in fine style.  The top of the 1st pitch doesn't freak me out any more.  I flailed for quite a while on the boulder problem at the start of the 2nd pitch.  Jesse is taller and was able to highstep from the ledge to the good hold and do a powerful sidepull to stand up on it.  I gave up and opted for the bypass to the right and then went up the rest of the route in good styke.  Don't think I'm ready to lead it quite yet though -- need to get stronger so the liebacking feels more like a cakewalk.\
\
Then we headed over to the notorious Saggitarius.  I led up to the big roof in one pitch.  Damn, that's a lot of liebacking.  Jesse finished off the 11b roof, which I flailed mightily on.  Clearly I need to spend more time sport-climbing and bouldering to get stronger.  \
\
The rack I used to just below the roof was, I believe:\
\
1 yellow alien \
1 red alien \
2 .orange alien \
2 #1 Camelot \
1 #3 Camelot \
1 #3.5 Camelot \

"snow-creek-wall","outerspace","This saturday I did it with Eric Babson and while fun, I didn't think it should be worthy of classic status.  If there were no chicken heads I would have found it way more fun.  \
\
The start of the route wasnt real clear to us so we started off route on some 5.7 dirty stuff but eventually traversed back to two tree ledge.\
\
The finger traverse was cool and got my heart rate up a bit.  It actually gave me a lot of trouble with rope drag.  I extended every piece I put in with a single runner and the piece right before the corner I put a double runner on, but this unfortunately put the rope right at the level of a notch in the rock that increased rope drag to the point where by the time I got around the corner beyond the traverse and under the overhang below the anchor I was frozen by rope drag.  I managed to haul out enough rope to climb on up to the anchor and then clipped in and couldnt haul any more rope.  hmmm what to do  <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\"" alt=\"":shock:\"" title=\""Shocked\"" /><!-- s:shock: -->   I put my prusik on the rope and untied from the end and tied the end of the rope into the anchor, then downclimbed with my prusik self belay to back below the overhang and took out the piece there.  Then I could just barely haul with all my strength so I hauled up the rope one bit at a time and put Eric on belay while hanging from the anchor above.  (I backed up the prusik with a figure 8 first.  ANd I had backed up the anchor tree with a big solid nut but the tree shifted a bit while I was belaying Eric up, yikes.  Eric kept on going past me, definitely surprised by my hanging stance and clipped into the anchor and I self belayed back up after him.\
\
Almost got a cam stuck but otherwise everything went smooth.  The downclimb was super dusty and loose.  Coming out we saw a girl with a splinted ankle making her way down the climbers path, that must have really sucked.\

"Mount-stuart","W Ridge of Stuart 9.6.05","Jesse and I climbed the West Ridge of Stuart yesterday to give me food for thought while I’m in hilly, bonny Scotland for the next four months.\
\
We woke up in the trailhead parking lot at 4:30am. After packing up the tent and rocking out to some tunes, especially the soundtrack for this climb – “Age of Pamparius” by Turbonegro, we hit the trail by 5:00. Hiking fast in the dark, we neglected to turn off for Ingalls Pass and instead arrived at the western end of Esmerelda Basin by 6:30. Not seeing Stuie, we backtracked to the Lake Ann trail and took this over a ridge to Lake Ann on the northwest slopes of Ingalls Peak. We then crossed over the NW ridge of Ingalls Peak and sidehilled across the N slope on talus, scree and gravel. After an agonizing half hour of this, we ascended loose rock to the East/West Saddle near Stuart Pass. We had effed up the approach big time and we felt it in our minds and our bodies. We gained the first gully at 10:00, about 2.5 hours behind schedule. \
\
The first two gullies went extremely quickly. We soloed up a few low-fifth sections to the notch behind Long John Tower. We then ascended to the prominent scissor formation on the West Horn and traversed just below the crest to a few hundred feet above the West Ridge Notch where we met a couple of fellow climbers. All four of us swung onto the north side for about a hundred yards of frosty 4th class. Back on the south side, we said goodbye to our fellow climbers and scrambled up more 4th class until we arrived at the first and only section we pitched out. Jesse led on my doubled over 60m, 8.1mm half rope. He guessed the pitch at about 5.4 and that only because of three short, but steep crack sections. We arrived on top at 2:20. \
\
The summit was great, as always, and we lingered for about 40 minutes. Returning to the bumbling, inept form that had characterized the approach, we followed a group of inexperienced scramblers about 300 feet down the rib separating Ulrich’s and the Cascadian and wasted about ½ hour before climbing right back up. (Beta: to access Cascadian, stay high and cross the Ulrich’s/Cascadian rib just south of the false summit.) We eventually made it to the soft, forgiving soils of the Cascadian Couloir where evidence from Ben’s unforgivable descent had been completely obliterated by the well-defined trail. The hike out went smoothly until just above the timber west of Cascadian meadows where Jesse spotted a mountain lion in time to see it crash into the dense brush that our trail was about to wind its way through. We both picked up a few baseball-sized rocks for self-defense. Luckily, we did not see or hear the lion again. After filtering some water, we went up Long’s Pass, snapped some photos and arrived back at the car (and Turbonegro) by 8:00pm – 15 hours after our departure.  \
\
A fantastic, if taxing, climb with a terrific partner. Pictures later today."
,"Not Classic","Ben, \
\
Nice work, I know you have been wanting to get on OS for a while now.  I'm surprsied you didn't find the climbing on par with its classic status.  Granted the regular start is kind of crappy, but after that the climbing is awesome IMO.  The chicken heads make most of the headwall pretty easy, but it is still some of the most enjoyable climbing I can imagine.  Plus, the short finger crack bit adds a little bit of spice to things.  Are there other local moderates you have done that you felt had better moves/position/quality?"
"Vesper-peak","Discoveries Beyond Vesper Peak","[img:1o1e9nco]http&#58;//www&#46;catdaddy&#46;com/people/kevin/images/05_09_Vesper/small/GraniteNirvana&#46;jpg[/img:1o1e9nco]\
\
Brian and I spent a day and a half in the vincinity of Vesper Peak off the Mountain Loop, exploring a high ridgeline connection to Big Four. We indeed found the connecting passage by going over Vesper near the Copper Glacier, but turned around short of Big Four’s Chossy Knuckles, for we had stumbled into Granite Nirvana- \
\
We left Seattle Sunday evening with dark clouds building up all around. Rumor has it that those clouds delivered some impressive downpours to the city that evening as the convergence zone shifted south. Evidence in the form of what appeared to be snow down to 4000' on Pilchuck attested to some convective activity earlier in the day at the Mountain Loop. As we approached the Sunrise Mine trailhead, three soaking wet hikers staggered out onto the road, appearing surprised that anyone else would be venturing back up there with only a few hours of daylight left.\
\
We hiked up Wurtz Basin in the evening accompanied by remnant showers to clearing skies, camping in a nice spot Brian had bookmarked earlier in Elan Lake Basin. Morning brought clear skies, and I went for a sunrise run up the clean white granite of Vesper. Flames spewed forth from Headlee Pass. Wispy inland seas evaporated as soon as the light hit them. After sunrise, we both set forth to see if we could discover a route out of the basin and onto the continuous ridge leading toward Big Four. We applied some non-linear routefinding techniques, wandering first from Marmot Ledges to Signal Knob, then down through the Copper Glacier Purgatory and up the Captain's Chimneys, finally reaching Granite Nirvana.\
\
It was the best of the Cascades and Tuolumne all in one concentrated spot. Clean polished granite everywhere. Horizontal slabs formed a gentle ridgeback, which were then warped into smooth bowls by the glaciers and carved upward into a sharp vertical ridges and arching walls. The impressive north face on Vesper towers above.\
\
At the base of the slabs a small tarn pokes out amidst golden grasses and sweet low-bush huckleberries. A pair of dragonflies intertwined in flight rise from the waters edge. Glacier Peak smiles in the distance with a fresh dusting of snow. The waters reflect a world of granite with a backdrop of building cumulus. Soon however the shadows grow longer and it is time to go.\
\
If only Nirvana were so easy to return to. A single rappel proved useful getting back down the Chimneys to the Copper glacier – the solid 4th class terrain was not too bad going up, but tricky to downclimb. Back down into the Copper Glacier Purgatory and we hear the distinct sound of a glacier burping -- ahh the sweet smell of pulverized rock -- yum! The ascent passed without incident, but each of us applied some more nonlinear routefinding techniques to get back to camp. Brian tags Vesper’s summit and I find some photographic reflection in Lake Elan. We set sail again back down the rocky trail with the Captain at the helm, and the spires fade out into the evening glow.\

"Dragontail-peak","Backbone Ridge on Dragontail, July 31, 2005","Gary was my sherpa to/from camp.  It was fabulous.  I really liked not shlepping all that weight.\
\
The climb was memorable:\
  1 - The Goodness Gracious offwidth (5.9) was horrible.  Traumatizing.  I've never worked so hard on a pitch.  Gary lead it, thank goodness.\
  2 - The 5.9 face on the fin was fabulous face climbing on solid rock.  Possibly the best alpine rock I've ever climbed.  I lead it, thank goodness.\
  3 - The gulley we took to top out was the sketchiest, loosest stuff I've ever climbed.  (I think that's the wrong way to top out.)  I lead most of it, and I'm just thankful I never went sliding.\

"index","Index: All Dewy-Like","Ben Kunz and I went to Index on Sunday, starting off the day around 1pm at the Inner Walls.  It was a little damp in the shade there, but we both led Corner Flash to warm up and did the optional offwidth section again on TR (practice for Backbone Ridge).  There was another party over at Toxic Shock, but they never started up the route for some reason.  The lieback start on the left was wet, so I led the left crack on the right side (#4 Friend and Camalot useful here), pulled the rope, and continued up.  What an awesome pitch!\
\
Ben followed and set a TR on Even Steven.  Ridiculously good, one of the best single pitches I've climbed in a while.  The gear looks great, too, so I'll have to go back and lead it.  Ben followed without cursing nearly as much as I did.  Those Canadians are so polite!\
\
We then hiked back down to GNS to be greeted by some friendly dogs.  They bouldered around on the rocks and whined for their owners while Ben racked up for the deceivingly easy-looking first pitch of Aries.  Who should wander by but Mike Schmitt?  Poor guy, stuck at Index with no rock shoes <!-- s;) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\"" alt=\"";)\"" title=\""Wink\"" /><!-- s;) -->\
\
Ben dicked around with the belay below Libra for a while, but eventually I got to lead off.  The upper crack on the slab takes hexes 8, 9, and 10, in that order.  Neat-o.  Ben climbed through to the top of the GNS and we hiked up to Winkie Dinkie Cliff.  There are three decent-looking routes up there, but we only had time left for one: a dirty little 5.8 up some thin flakes, a hand crack, and a couple bolts, finishing with some offwidth/flake-humping.\
\
We rapped/downclimbed in a hurry, since it was getting dark.  There's a fixed rope in the approach chimney on the right side of GNS for a quick descent of the last tier.\
\
Traffic on Hwy 2 was ridiculous, even at 8 o'clock, thanks to I-90 being closed.  It took almost 2 1/2 hours to get home."
"prusik-peak","Prussik Peak, South Face","Gordy Smith and I climbed this route yesterday. It was burly! But fabulous.\
The grade of \""5.9+\"" is nice for historic purposes (what, 1968 or so?), but by modern standards the last pitch would merit about 5.10a or 10b. I mean, the crux on Outer Space (5.9) is just a few miles away, but is definitely a couple of grades easier. I thought the chimney pitch was even harder, but I'm just not a chimneying kind of guy. \

There it was, the top of the corner and of the route! Within spitting distance, I got all excited, slotted the jam, pasted my feet in a layback, stretched - and my foot skidded...\
\
Nooooooooo! I fell on the last move of the whole climb, my head practically peering over the summit. The move wasn't any trickier than stuff lower down, but I guess I was impatient. I got back up and did it just fine, furious with myself. I guess I'll have to return and do it clean one of these days. Gordy seconded and took a hang there, just to make me feel better. \

,"I have a fever and the only perscription is...","Ice climbing in September!\
Since I climbed with him, I'll do this TR a laNick Bratton:\
\
Short version-  Nick heard from a friend about an alpine ice climb near Rainier that stays in shape all year and that he should go solo.  Nick was kind enough to invite me along so I could swing tools one last time before leaving the states\
\
Long Version- Leaving Seattle at 6am, we made the quick drive (~1.5hrs) to the Mowich lake trailhead in Rainier Nat'l Park.  From there we took the trail to Spray Park (2.8miles) and then hiked up through Spray Park to a climbers trail near 6500' (maybe another 1.5-2mi).  Followed the climbers trail to the base of some small patches of glacier.  The problem up until now is that Nick's friend said the route was easy to find because you could easily see it from Spray Park, howevey, Spray Park was in the middle of a bunch of clouds, so we were just hoping we were on the right path. \
Past these small glaciers we saw a ridgeline to the west that we jogged up and found ourselves bathed in sunlight above a large sea of clouds- it was pretty sweet.  We immediately found our route (a broad ice face on Observation Rock that was pretty obvious once we actually saw it) and began traversing across scary scree to its base.\
I've never been real big on soloing and we had brought a rope so I suggested we simul the whole thing since it wasn't all that difficult: beginning with 45degree slope slowly progressing to 50 or 55 degrees.  I racked up all 5 ice screws and lead out.\
We finished the route in 39 mintues and as he got to the top Nick pointed out that he didn't feel that a single one of those screws would have held a fall   <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\"" alt=\"":shock:\"" title=\""Shocked\"" /><!-- s:shock: -->   oh well, the climbing was easy and the alpine ice was super sticky, every swing was awsome and stuck perfectly.\
We then toped out on Observation Rock with awsome views of the Mowich face on Rainier and began descending.  Once we hit the cloud cover we got pretty lost without having a map or compass (oops)  but eventually found our way back to the trail.\
On the hike out I was feeling pretty tired and the 2.8 mile hike from spray park to the parking lot fellt pretty long, so I deduced that Rainier Nat'l Park sandbags their milage ratings: it's like the Index of hiking.  Or I'm just really out of shape and like to complain...\
\
Notes on the climb-  This is a lot of hiking for just a little bit of climbing, but it makes a great day-trip for people needing to climb ice.  Like I said, the route is in great shape right now (most of it stays out of the sun) but the pro isn't really there so it would make (like Nick's friend said) a good solo or simul solo if you want to bring a friend.  I don't have a website right now, so if you want pics of the route or more info ont eh approach, just pm me and I'll give you what you need.\
Thanks Nick for and awsome day!"
"Mount-rainier","labor day mt. rainier trip","I brought my friend up the DC over labor day weekend; I assumed it would be packed but it turned out to be just a few climbers outside of the RMI crew, so Muir was actually pretty uncrowded...The shelter being closed must have made people change plans. The route was in great condition, albeit a bit longer than usual because it traversed way out the Emmons above the DC and then switchbacked to the crater. It wasn't a very exciting trip, but we went from Port Angeles to the summit to Port Angeles in 48 hours, which included a night at my friend's house in North Seattle and a lengthy teriyaki stop in Tacoma.

"Burgundy-spire","Paisano Pinnacle + Burgundy Spire, Sep. 18","[b:2yvf0fqy]Short attention-span version:[/b:2yvf0fqy]\
\
Ben and I climbed some rocks on Sunday.  This was preceded by some hiking, which we enjoyed immensely, and also some camping.\
\
[b:2yvf0fqy]Usual long-winded version:[/b:2yvf0fqy]\
\
Ben and I left Seattle Saturday around 1pm and got to Burgundy Col well before dark.  I drive fast and aggressively, at least compared to the polite Canadian norm.  The hike to Burgundy Col is on my shit list of steep and/or annoying slogs, right up there with Camp Muir and Ass-taastic Pass.  But at least it's a straightforward, get-'er-done kinda deal.  And it sure is purty up there.\
\
We passed two groups on the hike up, both of which gave us earnest and useless beta.  The first, two guys who were bailing from \""a traverse\"" of unspecified breadth, told us that everything was covered in verglas.  They seemed credible and, in hindsight, were probably guides, so Ben and I laughed nervously.  The second group were Mounties or similar, the leader of whom wasn't really listening when we said we were climbing the North Face of Burgundy and proceeded to give us useful tips for accessing the Corkscrew Route.  We slogged on.\
\
It was chilly that night, but our bivy spot was well-sheltered from the wind.  We read a photocopy of Kearney's route description and, on his recommendation, decided to check out Paisano Pinnacle before dark.  Tacking on a few more pitches by starting with the Pinnacle looked like a good idea, as long as we were up there.\
\
In the morning, Ben used up the last of my camera's juice taking panoramic photos, so there are no pictures of sweet granite jamming and such.  We started up Paisano and enjoyed several pitches of varied climbing on the West Buttress, all on good to excellent rock.  The climbing so far had gone pretty quickly, even if we didn't do much simulclimbing, so we figured we'd fly up Burgundy, too.\
\
From the top of Paisano, we scrambled down into the mini-amphitheater partway up Burgundy's North Face route.  Ben led an easy pitch on crumbly rock, with me yelling \""Protect the traverse!\"" and grumbling about cold hands.  Ben had enjoyed the only sunlit lead so far and I was eager to get moving.  I climbed straight up a series of flakes that finally got the blood flowin', especially when my foot skated and I thought I might go for a ride.  I hate liebacking.\
\
Ben led a short pitch to the big sandy ledge and then our routefinding troubles commenced.  He tried up a short rightward ramp, but blanked out.  Then over toward the left skyline, but saw only black lichen (I think this is where Eric and Mike went).  I eventually untied and walked under a huge fallen block to the far right end of the ledge.  Aha, here were some options!\
\
First I tried the \""obvious long clean corner,\"" a phrase used in Kearney's description.  This corner, however, ended in what looked like a 10a chimney, which gave me The Dreaded Shrinkage.  I downclimbed to a rappel sling and we both bailed to the sandy ledge.\
\
I gave up the lead to Ben, who did a left-traversing lead over a licheny flake, ending at a bolted anchor.  Sweet, now for the business.  I went up a short Squamishy finger/hand crack to a stance, then chose the right-hand offwidth/squeeze, which looked easier than the left one.  This last stretch involved the most grunting and sweating of the whole route, and it ended right at the summit.  What a cool finish!\
\
We started rapping right away, since it was getting cloudier in the west and we sensed we'd be racing darkness on the hike out.  Our several extra routefinding pitches had eaten up lots of time.  On the fourth rappel, the rope got stuck and I got that sinking feeling.  Thankfully, the stuck end whipped down at us after a big tug and we rushed to pack up and bomb down the trail, reaching the car a few minutes after dark.\
\
I have to agree with Kearney in calling the Paisano-Burgundy linkup a classic.  Plenty of climbing, plenty of variety, mostly awesome rock.  I'd go do it again... and next time, I'm doing that chimney."

Of note, the wind was a blowing on this particular evening. Photos of a ridge and a face were obtained at over 170mph (90-100mph in the other direction). These two photos were about 50 ft above summit level and 300-500 ft away from the mountain horizontally. Turbulence was encountered on this pass."

Beautiful, we were the only ones there until we were back within a mile of the trailhead."
,"Jacob's Ladder on Blueberry Hill","In an effort to keep our sanity/productivity, Ania and I went to Darrington in search of beautiful granite.\
\
Matt Perkins had been raving to me about Jacob's Ladder, a route he put up on the steeper headwall north of the West Buttress (which Ania and I climbed about two years ago).  We drove up there, the 2wd scraping bottom some on the first washout.  Soon we were hiking up the Granite Sidewalk.  We kinda bungled the approach, bypassing the first two low-5th pitches by scrambling from the side to a grassy shelf.  \
\
Here's Ania following pitch 3, some 10b face/slab.  Our pack marks the top of the second pitch, where we merged with the route.\
\
[img:2bd4lmzv]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/JacobsLadder/zIMG_1386&#46;JPG[/img:2bd4lmzv]\
\
The route, being west-facing, was in the shade in the morning.  But the peaks to the west looked great.  Fall is pretty in Darrington, with the brush turning red and yellow.  The promiment buttress is home to Dreamer.\
\
[img:2bd4lmzv]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/JacobsLadder/zIMG_1389&#46;JPG[/img:2bd4lmzv]\
\
The fourth pitch was the crux pitch, supposedly having a single mid-11 move and otherwise generally being sustained 10+/11- face climbing.  We were waiting for the sun, and Ania took her time warming her toes, warming her shoes, switching from her comfy shoes to her Katanas, etc., but the sun seemed to creep ever so slowly.  So she began climbing.  We had bets on whether she'd have to hang, or have to pull on bolts, but I don't think we remember what exactly the bets were on, and I don't think we ever decided what we were betting.  Anyway, she climbed the pitch in style, consistently staying 5-10 feet above the su n.  Higher on the pitch, she had to hang and rest, and got the crux on her second attempt.  (The pitch has bolts 6-8 ft apart when the climbing's hard.)  Higher up, she started to feel the sun, at least on her body, if the rock was still in shadow (meanwhile I was gloriously basking in it at the belay).\
\
[img:2bd4lmzv]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/JacobsLadder/zIMG_1395&#46;JPG[/img:2bd4lmzv]\
\
Ania and her Katanas were quite happy on the crux pitch, while I whined and blamed my struggling while following on my comfy alpine rockshoes and the pack.  I couldn't pull the crux move but was ok otherwise.  \
\
The next two pitches were listed as low-mid 10 and were pretty challenging.  I haven't climbed much rock this season, and most of that was steep crack at Index, very different from face and slab.  It was spooky, but I got through it (though with nowhere near the elegance that I cruised Merci Mi last year).  Ania found her pitch to be harder than the crux pitch!  There was one bolt lower down (traversing into a steep blank corner and then mantling to the top of a pedestal) that we both yarded on.  \
\
Ania describes the grades as, 5.11 is like low-5th -- it's easy and elegant, whereas 5.10 is like 4th class -- it's hard and scary.  She also describes herself as, \""You can make me climb trad, but I'll always be a sportclimber at heart.\""  I'd have to say the converse applies to me. <!-- s:P --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif\"" alt=\"":P\"" title=\""Razz\"" /><!-- s:P -->\
\
Here's Ania, in true Sporto style, changing shoes mid-pitch:\
\
[img:2bd4lmzv]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/JacobsLadder/zshoes&#46;jpg[/img:2bd4lmzv]\
\
A 5.8 pitch with some face and a short roof took us to a traversing pitch that led to the terrace.  We declined that pitch, as we had already done the cool climbing, the rappel might have been a pain, and we wanted to be back to the car by dark.  So we rappeled through the golden hour.\

"Seven-fingered-jack","Seven Fingered Jack 10/1-2","Fresh back from the trip and I'm trying to delay homework, so here's a tr.\
\
Friday afternoon Mal and I decided that we needed to seize our last weekend before field trip madness and head to the hills.  The forecast was for rain west side, snow in the Olympics and beautiful weather on the east side.  I ran into Lindsay while scouting for a trip in the library and she recommended Seven Fingered Jack for an eastside weekend excursion.\
\
Mal and I planned carefully over beer Friday night and departed at 8:30ish Saturday morning with a general idea of where we might be going.  The whole drive was rainy, but it was more or less not raining by the time we got there.  We hit the Phelps Cr. trailhead at 12somethingish and started a dilly-dally casual hike at 1somethingish.  After some side excursions we reached our camp at Leroy Cr at dinner time o'clock.  Mal had the all-you-can-eat Mountain House buffet and I had some PBand J despite his objections. We then did a little more wandering and decided to build a fire with wet wood to kill some time.  This fire would later claim my boots.\
\
We awoke to find a clear, but frosty everything at about 7:00.  We were on the trail and gaining elevation by 8 something.  On the hike we had some hopefully (but still too early to confirm) non-poisonous berries of unknown species, but of the genus Vaccinium.  We saw a spruce grouse and I almost stepped on a pair of ptarmigans.  Mal identified the wildlife while I added insight such as \""Oh, yeah\"
"sahale-mountain","Sahale (attempt) - 10/1/05","[i:2c18cdhw]2:00 PM, Saturday[/i:2c18cdhw].  I'm standing in wet, slushy snow on a flat about 50' below the summit of Sahale.  From time to time, the clouds thin enough to make out a talus field and glacier some 100' below.  Ben's trying to find some way up the snow covered rock above us and Mike has him on a tight belay.  I'm wearing soaking wet socks on my hands because I forgot my gloves.  The sun breaks through the clouds for a brief moment, the snow fades, and even the wind calms.  These are the good times.\
\
[img:2c18cdhw]http&#58;//photos25&#46;flickr&#46;com/48656764_8c42bd6bc4_m&#46;jpg[/img:2c18cdhw]\
\
Mike, Ben, and I decided to ignore the lousy weather forecast on Saturday and check out Sahale Peak.  We car-camped on Saturday night a bit below the Cascade Pass trailhead after doing our part to move a tree off the road a few miles from Marblemount.  I jokingly commented that someone might move the tree back onto the road for our return trip with a stern note to \""Leave no trace\"".\
\
Under dark skies and misting rain, we headed up to Cascade Pass at 7:00 am.  I hear the views are really nice, but all we got were occaisional glimpses.  As we neared the pass, signs of fresh snow abounded (all pictures are courtesy of Mike - one of these days I need to pick up a camera).\
\
[img:2c18cdhw]http&#58;//photos29&#46;flickr&#46;com/48656754_31913061cb_m&#46;jpg[/img:2c18cdhw]\
\
We reached the pass in good time and then made the mistake of letting Ben lead the way up Sahale Arm.  He told us he was feeling tired from soccer and running the day before, which was good, because I was certainly breathing pretty hard to keep up.  \
\
[img:2c18cdhw]http&#58;//photos29&#46;flickr&#46;com/48656757_b747ca700d_m&#46;jpg[/img:2c18cdhw]\
\
Despite the snow cover and low visibility, the trail was pretty easy to follow and we stopped for lunch at the base of the Sahale Glacier.  I chose the route on the way up and placed a lot of unnecessary ice screws (but hey, they're kind of fun to use).  The glacier has a few inches of fresh snow on it which reinforced the need to pick up now anti-balling plates for my crampons.\
\
[img:2c18cdhw]http&#58;//photos27&#46;flickr&#46;com/48656762_226e25f040_m&#46;jpg[/img:2c18cdhw]\
\
We had just enough visibility to navigate towards the semi flat area below the summit block where we unroped.  Ben found us a scramble route along the SE ridge.  As the rock steepened, we roped back up and Ben led a pitch up to the first rappel anchor on the standard route.  Here despite valiant efforts by both Mike and Ben, we were stopped by wet, snow-covered rock 50' below the summit.  So, reluctantly, but feeling pretty good for getting as far as we had, we rapped back down to the talus field.\
\

(note: my first left-handed rap.  good times)\
\
With a little help from a GPS (weather still not cooperating), we made it back down the Arm , noting that there was a lot more snow than there had been in the morning.\
\
[img:2c18cdhw]http&#58;//photos31&#46;flickr&#46;com/48656753_3ee586fe15_m&#46;jpg[/img:2c18cdhw]\
\
The weather finally cleared a little near the bottom of the arm, giving us a chance to take in some magnificent fall colors, larch, and fresh snow.  Summer seems to be officially over.  Powered by wasabi cashews, we dropped down to the cars and headed back to Seattle.\
\
RT: ~12-13 miles.  Nearly 12 hours car-to-car."
"Vesper-peak","UWCC storms Vesper Peak!","Brian's first hiking trip of the year provoked a massive outpouring of enthusiasm from the UWCC ranks, both new and old. A keen group of 22 folks turned up at the Burke on Sunday morning, despite clouds in the sky and the difficulties of getting up on Sunday mornings. \
\
Six cars roared off to the Mountain Loop Highway. Destination: Vesper Peak, a worthy objective promising a stout approach hike and some scrambling on granite slabs. We convened at the parking area and quickly took off into the dark forest. \
\
\
(this photo sucks, but is a nice beginning to the story; other pics are better)\
[img:jf9rkwri]http&#58;//i11&#46;photobucket&#46;com/albums/a166/perkins666/VesperPk_01&#46;jpg[/img:jf9rkwri]\
\
The massive group soon evolved into at least 3 separate groups hiking at different speeds. Because we're all so nice and chummy, the faster folks waited periodically, and we managed to regroup at a few different places. \
\
Finally out of the shrubbery and onto the talus (Kelsey and Dallas):\

\
After wandering upvalley some more, we reached the famous gulley below Headley Pass. What is it, like 27 switchbacks or something up that thing? \
\
Switchbacking up towards the pass (Dylan and ?):\

\
After Headley Pass, it actually feels like you're up in the alpine. Big rock walls, talus slopes, small tortured trees, misty vistas - it's all there.\
\
Dallas and hardcore cotton dude - sorry man, don't remember your name! - on the talus slope:\

\
We stopped by the lake at a slightly breezy and nipply lunch spot. All 22 of us (not including your humble narrator) amongst the boulders: \
[img:jf9rkwri]http&#58;//i11&#46;photobucket&#46;com/albums/a166/perkins666/VesperPk_07&#46;jpg[/img:jf9rkwri]\
(Brian, our fearless leader, is in orange just right of center; his equally-fearless roommate, Mr Peach, is also in orange, right in the middle)\
\
Above the lake, the trail quickly turns into a sea of slabs. Beautiful, clean granite slabs, with copious class 2+ terrain and maybe even a class 3 move here or there. Smear, smear, smear, pad pad pad - up we wandered into the mist. \
\
Here are Dylan and Cotton dude up near the summit:\
[img:jf9rkwri]http&#58;//i11&#46;photobucket&#46;com/albums/a166/perkins666/VesperPk_09&#46;jpg[/img:jf9rkwri]\
\
And finally, on top! We huddled around the summit blocks while Brian, prince of trip leaders, busted out the stove and brewed up some hot chocolate! What a guy. The Bailey's didn't hurt either. Dallas' cold cider was greeted with some skepticism, but eventually quaffed as well. Of course we couldn't see shit up there. \
\
Bust out those layers:\
[img:jf9rkwri]http&#58;//i11&#46;photobucket&#46;com/albums/a166/perkins666/VesperPk_10&#46;jpg[/img:jf9rkwri]\
\
And before we knew it, everyone had had enough of shivering around in the cold and drizzle. We packed up and descended, peering into the gloom to see the cairns leading back down to the trees, the lake, Headley Pass, the blueberry patches (abundant berries, but kind of tart) and finally the stream crossings and the cars. Hey, we didn't even lose anyone!\
\
Running back down the gulley from Headley:\

Many thanks to Brian for organizing, to Gary for playing sweeper and making sure no one got lost, and to all of the participants. It was a pleasure meeting the new folks on the trip. Welcome to the club!\

"Granite-mountain-snoqualmie","Granite Mt, Peak 5566, and some lakes","Saturday, 10/8/2005 \
\
Destinations: Granite Mt, Peak 5566 (aka Tusk O'Granite), and lakes\
\
Woke up early and headed for the Talapus Lake trailhead(take exit 45). I arrived at 7:45 and was the first car there except for someone who had spent the night. I made my way easily to Talapus Lake.\
[img:3se2ua60]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/31/52479903_8613d82410&#46;jpg[/img:3se2ua60]\
\
\
\
I continued on the trail past Ollalie and several hundred yards past the inlet stream I met the guy who had spent the night. We chatted a bit, and then I headed into the woods so I could intersect the west ridge of Peak 5566. I had to scramble up a talus field and the wetness made for some slippery rocks. I made it easily to the summit. Views were limited due to the cloud cover. \
\
Views near the summit.\

\
\
I then headed east and dropped down to Crystal Lake, a lovely little gem that doesn’t get much trampling.\

\
\
I found a faint path and followed it to connect up with the Granite Mtn trail just below the summit. There was a good deal of people headed for Granite today. Once on top, I stayed for a while to eat my lunch before heading for the saddle(5080+) south of Peak 5566. \

\
\
I then began the decent to the trail above Ollalie Lake that involved some very wet brush and slippery terrain. Needless to say, by the time I reached the trail I was soaked. I then crashed my way to Ollalie Lake before making my way down the busy trail to my car. \

I then rushed to Seattle and took a short nap before heading to work at five.\

,"Saska and Emerald Peak - 10/22 - 10/23","Looking at the forecast for the weekend Nick, Lindsay, and I headed east and were rewarded with great weather for two days out in the Entiats.  Managed to scramble Saska and Emerald on Sunday, but got shut down on Cardinal on Saturday due to time and route-finding.\
\
Getting there is probably the toughest part - about a 4 hr drive from Seattle to the North Fork Entiat River trailhead.  From Entiat, Entiat River Road is in great shape and FS 5606 is in better shape than nearly any other forest road I've been on.  In fact, I can't really say enough good things about how well this area is maintained - great signage, good roads, well maintained trails, informative trail signs.  Hell, even the camp spots are marked with names like Good, Buck, Buddy, and Devil.\
\
We chose to approach via the Pugh Ridge Trail.  No real views until you break out on the ridgeline, but then *wham* Pyramid Peak is right there in your face.  Great views of the valleys on both sides from the ridge.  The whole area is just ablaze with larches and the ground golden with fallen needles.  After about a mile along the ridge, we dropped down to Buck Camp and then quickly regained the elevation to Grousse Pass.  From here, the trail winds down to intersect the N. Fork Entiat River Trail.  We found a great campsite in the meadows about 5 minutes north of the trail junction and unloaded our packs for an ascent of Cardinal.  Unfortunately, as we headed uphill from camp, we looked back to see what we first though was a BBQ grill, but then realized was the rib cage of a horse (head and legs still intact).  \
\
Slightly grossed out, we continued uphill ended up in the wrong basin (thanks to some brilliant route-finding on my part), and then ascended some gnarly, loose, 3rd class gully to within about 100' vertical of the summit.  Great views of Glacier Peak, Rainier, and all that lies between.  In the alpinglow, we considered the exposed 3-4 class rock in front of us and decided to turn around.  Downclimbing and scree skiing got us back to our camp a few minutes after dark (GPS helpful).  Unfortunately, the wind had changed direction and the whole place now stank of dead horse.  With some haste, we tossed our gear back in our packs and headed further up the trail, finding a flat-forested area suitable for camping on the far side of the meadow.  Here, Nick and Lindsay whipped up some amazing alpine burritos which put all three of us into a food coma.\
\
Sunday, we woke to high clouds and got a liesurely start up towards Saska and Emerald.  Given our lack of success with Cardinal the day before, we decided to start with Saska - which is the easier of the two.  From where the trail curves around the south ridge of the peak (about 0.25 miles from the high meadow at 6900') we slogged up scree and fractured rock to the ridge proper.  The slog is pretty benign if you leave the trail just after rounding the rib.  The ridge afforded us some broken, but suitably solid rock and improved the higher we got.  There is a large marker cairn where it is best to cross from the south side of the ridge to the north.  From where you cross the ridge, the rock is quite sound and scrambling easy.  From the summit, we could see that nearly everything to west looked pretty socked in.  Maude, Jack, Fernow, Clark, and Bonanza all had their heads in the clouds.  Hung out on the summit for a bit, signed the register, and then headed back down.  1.5 hours up, 0.5 hour down.\
\
Feeling pretty good about our sucess on Saska, we decided to give Emerald a go.  Returning to the 6900' meadow, we took off generally uphill following a dried up streambed into a basin.  From there, the best route is to head to climber's left and up to a long scree and talus slope.  We went to climber's right and had to cross over onto this other slope on the way up.  From the correct slope, cross back to climber's right at an obvious marker cairn (do not go all the way to the top on the talus and scree) and then scramble pleasant rock to the summit.  There are a few reassuring marker cairns if you're on the right route.  From the summit, we could see that the clouds had advanced further west and had now engulfed Pinancle and seemed on the verge of swallowing Saska.  A spritz of rain convinced us to head back down without loitering too long.  We think the highest summit is the one on the left, but both are scrambles.  1.5 hours up, 0.5 hour down - consistent, eh?\
\
The spritz on Emerald never materialized into anything worse and we made it back to camp, packed up, and hiked out the North Fork Entiat trail under a mix of clouds and sun.\
\
This is a great area to visit this time of year.  The larches are spectacular (I've never seen so many!), rock remains snow free, and enough rain has fallen to cut down on the dust and provide a steady run-off in most of the streams.  Saska and Emerald are both fun scrambles (class 2, minimal exposure) and it's entirely possible that Cardinal is as well if you end up on the right route.  All three involve some annoying scree on the uphill, but that provides for some scree glissades on the way down.\
\
Good times had by all, of course."

\
Got up thinking I'd solo the icefall so I climbed back up to the col and started the long ass traverse with a beautiful sunrise keeping my spirits high\
[img:2c9pwodk]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/benlong/pictures/Maude/DSCN1612z&#46;jpg[/img:2c9pwodk]\
\
Finally got to a glacier, but didnt know where I was so I thought it was the top of the icefall\
[img:2c9pwodk]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/benlong/pictures/Maude/DSCN1617z&#46;jpg[/img:2c9pwodk]\
\
and if that was true then this must be the rock ridge to go up\
[img:2c9pwodk]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/benlong/pictures/Maude/DSCN1620z&#46;jpg[/img:2c9pwodk]\
\
Well that didn't seem like 4th to low 5th...  So I backed off and started traversing back dissapointed, thought \""might as well scramble up to the summit anyways and started going up another gully E of the S face\
[img:2c9pwodk]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/benlong/pictures/Maude/DSCN1626z&#46;jpg[/img:2c9pwodk]\
\
That didnt feel much better so traversed around to the south side and went up the regular way.\
\
Getting close to the summit\
[img:2c9pwodk]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/benlong/pictures/Maude/DSCN1629z&#46;jpg[/img:2c9pwodk]\
\
\
from the summit looking at a sweet couloir on the S face, now why didnt I get my courage up and traverse the glacier over to that couloir, would have been fun, but I was feeling pressured to get back to camp since Jesse would soon get up, pack up, and hike to the car without me.\
[img:2c9pwodk]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/benlong/pictures/Maude/DSCN1631z&#46;jpg[/img:2c9pwodk]\
\
Dropped down some gully on the west side to get back to the col coming out of leroy basin, man did that suck, big loose scree and dropoffs, sidehilling, etc.\
\
Made it back to camp before Jesse had packed up my stuff and out we went.\
\
Beta:\
No clue <!-- s:? --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_confused.gif\"" alt=\"":?\"" title=\""Confused\"" /><!-- s:? --> since I never got to see the icefall, but the snow from last weekend is definitely dimished.\
\
Is it me or does the approach seem really indirect."

"Mount-rainier","Skiing on Rainier","I skinned up to Camp Muir on Saturday Oct.29 from Paradise with some friends.  Someone had left the door open to the hut and it was drifted in with waist deep snow.  We shoveled it out and then ate a quick and cold lunch.  Skiied down in about a foot of stiff powder for 3000' in patchy fog.  Not bad for October.  We then walked the rest of the way to the parking lot but many others skiied all the way down.  With the recent wet and cold weather the snow will probally be filled in all the way to the parking lot by this weekend."
,"Umtanum Creek","Saturday, October 29, 2005\
\
After a month of alternately crutching or slowly hobbling, I decided I'd been cooped up at home (or very nearby) for too long and decided to go on a hike.  Rain was forecast for west of the Cascades, so I drove east to Umtanum Creek, located about halfway between I-90 and Yakima.\
\
It was very pretty out there, with reds and yellows of fall among golden grassy hills.  The trail is very flat and mellow as it follows the creek. It's wide enough for easy crutching.   I think it'd be perfect for mountain biking with a 6 year old, although I don't have access to kids of that age to test my hypothesis.  I followed the trail for a mile or two, sat down and read for a bit to enjoy the outdoors without killing my wrists.  (Mind you, proper crutching technique should not bother your armpits in the least.  But that's a topic for the Know-How forum.)  Finally, I returned to the car. A mellow and beautiful trip, perfect for the cripple I have become.\

\
I also saw a bunch of birches that had been hacked along their bottoms.  Some were already dead.  Others were surely on their way, with the bark removed from the entire circumference.  I've no idea why people would do this, nor what animal would.\

"Mount-angeles","Mt Angeles","A few months back (something like 15 to be more exact) a group of us headed out from the wilds of Bainbridge Island in search of adventure in Olympic National Park. Here is the photographic evidence shot by Peter Nelson (known as bro Nelson in some circles). \

,"Snowshoin' to Boulder Lake and a 6000' knob 6 Nov. 2005","Thanks to Dallas and Oliver for posting their pics so promptly.  Their photo essays better illustrate this long-winded version of our snowshoein’ adventures. \
\
Short version: Sunday, 9 of us snowshoed (and skied) up to Boulder Lake. Fresh, heavy, undisturbed powder made the trail breaking slow going (for most of us). So instead of heading up our original objectives of Hurricane or Boulder Peaks we took in some views from a nearby knob, ate tasty snacks, lounged in the snow and had a good time while doing so. \
\
Long version: \
Sunday morning found two (pre-1995, relatively fuel efficient) Subarus headed north to Darrington where the first few rays of early morning sunlight illuminated a sucker patch of bright blue sky. Encountered snow on Tenas Creek Road above 2000 feet. After a slight swerveage of path brought the lead Subaru a few feet too close to a bridge’s guardrail   <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\"" alt=\"":shock:\"" title=\""Shocked\"" /><!-- s:shock: --> , we decided it was time to put the chains on. Soon after the two ‘Roos forged ahead to the trailhead, having just enough clearance to plow through the last mile. \
\
By 8:45 nine of us (Dallas, Stephanie, Brian, Oliver, Ethan, Kevin, Jim, Steffen and myself) were heading up the brushed out fisher's trail on route to Boulder Lake. Dallas and Brian took the first turn at breaking trail-\""slammin' jammin'-style”.  We followed a trail of sorts staying close to the creek and under the trees to minimize the wallowing in the deeper snow of the open areas.  While wandering through the forest, we eventually put on our snowshoes and broke out onto open slopes where trail breaking began in earnest. Each of us got a chance to part the white stuff from our path.  As the photos below show, at times we were wallowing in waist deep powder.\
\
Some of our photographer types stopped to capture the reflection of snow covered rocks in icy pools while others plunged ahead with the trail breaking duties up the talus slope that would eventually bring us to the lake.  As we switched back along the slopes Oliver developed an excellent technique for getting out of some of the more difficult posthole situations: slowly roll or slide down the slope to the more compact snow of the switch back below.  This method would later prove effective for a few other snowshoers (again, see photos below).  The slopes of the open forest were proving challenge to the diligent efforts of all us hearty trail breakers.  That is until, Steffen “The Plow” Mirsky and his snowshoes stepped in and rapidly hammered out a path up 200 feet of unconsolidated snow; spraying powder in the faces of those following behind him. \
\
Around noontime we made it to the shores of unfrozen Boulder Lake.  Views of craggy Hurricane Peak shifted in and out of the clouds while we warmed up with Kevin’s hot cider, Brian’s hot chocolate and other trail time goodies.  Well fed, we began the ascent to our high point for the day: a knob SE of the lake that would have views of the nearby mountains and possibly Pear Lake.  More deep powder, with quicksand tendencies, kept the pace of trail breaking slow; but we found ways to amuse ourselves as we loitered up the trail.  After Ms. Savage took down a few hundred feet of the white stuff, it was time, again, to send in “The Plow”.  Steffen staked out a path that carried us up and onto another ridge.  This one offered grand views of Hurricane Peak and Boulder Lake, so some folks decided to lounge in the snow and take in the biggest sun breaks of the day.  While our photographers snapped more shots, four of us headed up to the knob.  Topping out around 6000 feet, we had clear views of snow covered forests, the ridgeline of Hurricane Peak, Green Mountain and at times the flanks of Chaval.  \
\
With the sun finally low enough to break through the clouds it was time to head back.  We all enjoyed a few good slides and face plants as we descended back into the forest.  Alpine glow reflecting on the slopes and snow covered trees slowed a few of our photographers as they took the time to catch the good light.  Made it back to the cars just as it was time to don the headlamps.  \
\
Our drive down was through some slushy snow, but nothing eventful.  After making it pass the bridge, we took off the chains (thanks BP and EW) and headed out on the Suiattle River Road and back to Darrington.  After yoga stretches at the local Shell station we headed back to town.\
\
Good times had by all.\
\
Approximate trip stats:\
Around 7-plus hours to get to the top and 1.5 hours to get back down.  We probably covered 6 or 7 miles RT and gained 3000 feet over the course of the trip."

"green-giant-buttress-darrington","Dreamer attempt/approach 6.14.2009","This past Sunday Frank and I drove out to Darrington to try the climb Dreamer on the Green Giant Buttress. The road and trail suffer from a LOT of blowdown, which added a good amount of time to the approach, as did the hardcore bushwhacking to access the approach gully. We eventually ran into a large ice tongue in the gully and, because it was completely cloudy, couldn't tell how far it went, so we decided to turn around. It ended up not going very far, but we had already turned around and started descending, and didn't feel like trying the descent and hike out in the dark, which would have been required had we turned back around and tried to complete the climb (this was Frank's second attempt, having done the first 6 pitches previously). Despite not climbing anything, we had a good time hiking in what turned out to be a beautiful valley, and, much to my surprise, i actually enjoyed the bushwhacking. We did a good amount of trail work on the way out, but a lot still needs to be done, which will require loppers and a saw/axe/chainsaw.

"Mount-persis","Mt. Persis - 11/12/05","In a trip that could best be described as \""mellow\"" a number of UWCCers met up with some Mountaineers and a Bushwhacker for a snowshoe outing to Mt. Persis.\
\
After an obligatory stop at the Sultan Bakery, we turned off on FS Road 62 and after two left turns parked a bit above the snow line at the final fork.  The trail started off quite steep, but mellowed soon and would continue as such for the rest of the day.  Despite the powder and low visibility, we had little trouble staying on route.\
\
The summit area was quite interesting with high winds and variable freezing levels leading to rocks and trees heavily coated with crystalized snow.  I'm sure some of our photographers have some great shots (*cough* *Ethan* *cough*).  After a somewhat chilly lunch, we descended in good order, returning to the cars a bit before 3.  Nice to get back to Seattle while its still light.\
\
In attendence were: Dallas, Lindsay, Ethan, Oliver, Josh, Mike (schmmd), Robert, and myself.  Aaron overslept (again - though he swears he has a failsafe wake-up system for the next trip).\
\
On an unrelated note, I seem to be coming down with something which may or may not be related to staying up until 5:00 am Saturday night playing multiple rounds of \""flip-a-cup\"".  I may need to organize some sort of UWCC holiday social."
,"Uhhh, skiing(?) with Jimmy the Kid","The Persis trip being a success (see Brian's tr), I was back in Seattle Saturday night and ready to meet up with Jimmy the Kid to see Henry Rollins at the Moore.  Jim wasn't nearly as late as I would have expected, considering he had to work a couple of hours in the morning then drive about 8 hours.  Rollins was sort of a disappointment, I almost felt like I was listening to Tony Robbins at times, \""We are all hot in our own way.....\""  Plus some shameless movie plugs.  Anyway, on to the trip.\
\
We decided to head towards Arch Peak near Greenwater with Crystal as the back up plan.  The alarm went off at 6am and we had an exchange that went something like...\
Me \""It's 6, should I start the coffee or go back to sleep?\""\
Jim \"" Ummmmmm, ahhhhherrekdmfasdnsadj fjdfh;l ehhhhhh\""\
\
At 6:45 the alarm went off again and we were on our way.\
\
As we started onto FS road 70, we considered that we might need a Sno-Park permit, but continued onward..... Until we decided to turn around and buy one (about 10 minutes later).  Permit in hand (and a half hour later) we began to realize that it was Sunday and there seemed to be a congregation from the First Church of Internal Combustion heading the same way....\
\
[img:2oemq1ay]http&#58;//i18&#46;photobucket&#46;com/albums/b126/Hoscle/IMG_1469&#46;jpg[/img:2oemq1ay]\
\
The snow grew too deep for Jim's bald tires, the snowmobile traffic became too heavy for anyone's good, and, according to the GPS, we still had 1200 vertical feet to the trail head.\
\
To Crystal it was (now about 10am).  Instead of going up to Crystal, we stopped at the turnoff and skied into Rainier on a sheet of white stuff with about the same consistency as a Slurpee.\
\
[img:2oemq1ay]http&#58;//i18&#46;photobucket&#46;com/albums/b126/Hoscle/IMG_1470&#46;jpg[/img:2oemq1ay]\
\
Jim stopped to check out some bouldering problems, then he looked like this.\
\
[img:2oemq1ay]http&#58;//i18&#46;photobucket&#46;com/albums/b126/Hoscle/IMG_1471&#46;jpg[/img:2oemq1ay]\
\
The temperatures soared and we basked in the sun, while picnicking.\
\
[img:2oemq1ay]http&#58;//i18&#46;photobucket&#46;com/albums/b126/Hoscle/IMG_1472&#46;jpg[/img:2oemq1ay]\
\
The water ski down was kind of ugly and we decided to head up to Crystal proper.  As we stood in the parking lot, scheming on a bootleg strategy, Jim realized he longer had his GPS.  After an hour or so of stomping around in the snow, swearing, brain crunching, scouring the truck and considering skiing the now bare road, the GPS was declared lost.\
\
Back in Seattle we rendezvoused with DP for beer and za, then more beer.  We finished the evening by scouting some buildering;  Bank of America crack, Red Square towers, Kane hall, etc.  Then we were all tuckered out.  The End."

The following tr is for entertainment purposes only.  \
\
Once upon a time and a very good time it was, Brian, Carla, Ethan, and Dallas piled into an SUV and tried to drive up a steep road but the road was friend to ice and foe to cramponless automobile.  The dejected travelers were scared and fled into the mist of the valley below, where the cedars grew and the inversion layer chilled to the marrow.  The road of new was riddled with washout, passable only by the most stalwart of heart and fleet of foot.\
\
The depths of the forest ensconced the might of the slope, but our heroes sallied forth in search of God, gold, and glory.  Steepness of slope and depth of postholing were no match for the bottomless well of fortitude which sprung forth not in trickles, but in raging streams (cricks) from the quartet.  Day ebbed and night flowed as the high camp was constructed.\
\
[img:3ljl4s92]http&#58;//i18&#46;photobucket&#46;com/albums/b126/Hoscle/IMG_1500&#46;jpg[/img:3ljl4s92]\
\
A kitchen, paralled only by the lofty banquet hall of Valhalla, was constructed on a precipice to which Ethan fell victim innumerable times.  Brian was thwarted as many times as there are grains of sand in the Ganges by the corked bottle of Deltaforce.  \
\
In the balmy November night sprouted the seeds of anticipation for the challenges and rewards that the rise of Helios and his sick alpine light would bring.\
\

\
As day grew, the moon refused to perish and our band of mountain dwellers rose ever onward toward the hall of the mountain king.\
\

Menacing forms plagued the path.\

[img:3ljl4s92]http&#58;//i18&#46;photobucket&#46;com/albums/b126/Hoscle/IMG_1533&#46;jpg[/img:3ljl4s92]\
\
Finally, the summit was reached and the travelers were rewarded with feasts for the eyes and sustainance of the spirit.  Brian learned that a mountain is never conquered (even after four tries), but rather a treatise is attained between the primordial will of the earth and the endeavoring soul of man.  \
\

\
The force that compels the great ones upward must eventually give way to the force of gravity that binds them to this earth, for otherwise all would become seraphs on wings of Gore-tex (tm) (do seraphs have wings?).  Terra firma provides not only granite, but also the soil for the arborvitae (which we happened to see in a highway rest area).  The sun fell  as night grew heavy in the valley and overnight packs grew heavy on the shoulders of the weary travelers.  Their trusty vessel was found, still intact, on the shores of the mighty washout and it ferried them home to Seattle across the rivers of time and asphalt.\

Kudos to Brian for organizing one of the most beautiful weekends I have ever had in the mountains."
"Mount-rainier","Skiing on the big R","Sunday a full tele posse went to ski up to camp Muir. It was sunny and beautiful, and the snow was decent enough for slushy fun by the afternoon. To spice things up a big from the usual Muir Snowfield slog, we skied down the Nisqually chutes, to the SW from camp Muir. It was a mighty good time.\

Good times! I can't wait for winter to really be here.[/img]"
,"Exploring out by Money Creek: Pt. 4600 - 11/26/05","Short version:  A couple of us went out to play in the snow and explore the Money Creek drainage on Saturday.  We had good weather and lots of fresh powder and on the way home rescued a dog.\
\
Long version: A clear star-laden Saturday morning found Kevin, David, and I headed up Hwy 2 for a short day of snowshoeing.  Met up with Brad at the Sultan Bakery and drove on to Money Creek.  Our main objectives of the day were to play in the snow, get out to somewhere none of us had explored and if we were lucky have good views in the process.  \
\
About a mile from Hwy 2 we turned on to FS 6420 and proceeded to go up as far as the Subaru and then Brad’s truck would let us.  Hopped out of the truck and into a good 8” of fresh powder, already it was time to put on the snowshoes.   By 10:00 we were headed up the road toward Lake Elizabeth, each of us taking turns at trail bustin’.  The occasional patch of blue sky opened up around us and a few of the sucker holes seemed promising by the time we got to the lake.  Kevin had studied the maps the night before and had some ideas: head up and over to Crater Lake, seek out some interesting cliffs or forge up to a high point.  Looking in the direction of the largest patch of blue sky, we were soon scouting out a route up to the high point just south of Lake Elizabeth, later dubbed Point 4600.  \
\
Crossed over snow covered Money Creek and followed a few natural ramps up to a patch of easterly forest.  At times we were wadding through snow drifts almost reminiscent of the trip up to Boulder Lake.  Rounding SE through the forest (~4000’) we found a promising route up to our local maximum.  In the couple of hours since we had started out more clouds had moved off and at times the sun would shine at full force on our chosen summit and those of surrounding Crosby and Red mountains.  Thirty-five feet or so below the summit, icy snow-covered rocks threatened to shut down our plans to reach the local max.  But thanks to a determined Kevin, who scouted out a brushy route down and around these rocks, we were able to reach the top.  Elevation ~4600’.  The Tolt Reservoir and surrounding mountains offered a grand view as we warmed up with brownies and hot beverages.  \
\
Being that it was 2:30 in the afternoon and we needed to get a certain trip member back to town for his high school reunion, we headed down.  Often our descent involved glissading down our tracks and plowing through fresh powder.  The photographers among us stopped to capture the alpine light reflecting off the mountains, drifting clouds and the reservoir.   And even with a few of these stops we made it down to the lake and back to the car in good time.  What had taken us 4 hours to get up, took us one and a half hours to get down.  In all a beautiful, relatively mellow day out in the snow and mountains.\
\
While Kevin waited around to take a few more pics at Lake Elizabeth, Brad, David and I headed back to the truck and that’s where a few of the more memorable events from this trip began.  Brad’s truck seemed to have had enough of plowing through the white stuff on the way up and now it didn’t want to get out of the snow that was up to its floor boards.  30 minutes later after much shoveling, truck weighting and rocking we had freed the truck and it was turned in the direction to go back down to meet the Subaru.  Many thanks go to NWhiker member Jonathan  <!-- s:D --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\"" alt=\"":D\"" title=\""Very Happy\"" /><!-- s:D --> for helping us get the truck moving and to his family who-fresh Christmas tree in tow-patiently waited while we were figuring out how to do so.\
\
Headed back down the FS road about 5 minutes from the Subaru, a dog ran out of the woods and in front of Brad’s truck.  The pup wouldn’t move and so we all poured out of the cab and bed of the truck to shoo him off; only to have the dog hop into the cab.  After some coordinated tugging and nudging we had Beaufort the German short haired pointer (hooray for people licensing their pets!) out of the truck.  Beaufort then decided it would be a good idea to duck underneath the truck and stay put.  A few more nudges and (gentle) prods with a trekking pole got him to scurry out from beneath the truck.  I than ran with him up to a car about 100 yards back that we thought must have been his owner.  Turn’s out the guy wasn’t and while I had stopped to ask him, Beaufort had taken off up the road. <!-- s:? --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_confused.gif\"" alt=\"":?\"" title=\""Confused\"" /><!-- s:? -->  Where had this dog come from?  \
\
We drove the rest of the way back to the Subaru, where shortly after the man (not Beaufort’s person) drove past us and Beaufort was running behind the car.  We caught him and promptly put him in the bed of Brad’s truck with the plan of calling the number on his ID tag, once we got back into cell phone range.  Thankfully, on our way down a truck drove up the road looking for their lost dog that had apparently jumped out of their rig earlier chasing after something furry.  A much happier Beaufort was reunited with his much happier people.  <!-- s:D --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\"" alt=\"":D\"" title=\""Very Happy\"" /><!-- s:D --> \
\
These mini adventures contributed to us getting back on Hwy 2 a good hour and half later than anticipated.  Needing to get back for the Rough Rider reunion as soon as possible Mr. Steffa used the handy atlas (thank you Lissa!) to scout out a few back roads around Index and Sultan that likely shaved a few minutes and much idling time.  In between the stop and go break lights of Hwy 2 we ate some pumpkin cheesecake and eventually made it back to town.  All three objectives accomplished and we saved a dog too.  A good day.\

,"Dry tooling at Exit 38","There are 3-4 short bolted routes specifically for dry tooling (mixed climbing if you will) at Exit 38.  It's a short wall below the Iron Horse trail farther east that the easterly Exit 38 crags.  \
\
I went out there on Saturday with Kirk (non-UWCC), slogged around in knee deep powder until we finally found it (we had a brutal approach description from CC).  It was snow covered, cold and snowing, so we had to search for tool placements and bolts as we went.  We got on a route that was pretty tough and had some tricky sections to it.  We both found we had to be super precise with our crampon placements and even then it was pretty thin.  \
\
The crag above us had several frozen ice chucks which broke off throughout the day (nothing that would severly harm you) but really added to the experience!  (Remember your helmets.)  We had a great time and we both felt we improved our crampon precision throughout the day. \
\
Note - these routes are designated for dry tooling.  You could sport climb them when they're try, but the ability to smear all the moves would make it boring and the climbing easy.  I tried smearing with my pons to no avail!"
,"Hubba Hubba","The main flow, the dirty one, was in so Jason and I got in line to climb it Saturday.  \

Route was kinda thin in places, but lots of fun, WI3 conditions.  Three parties up there; expect it to be crowded for as long as it's cold in der 11worth, but there's other stuff nearby and the falls are wide enough for more than one group.   Jason should have some pics that weren't taken with shaking hands and are a bit sharper."
"del-campo-peak","Del Campo Peak 12/11/05","In the vein of, \""Let's repeat the same peak with the same results\"" theme I seem to have going, I found myself turning around 50' below the summit of Del Campo Peak this afternoon.  Of course, the feelings of crushing disappointment were somewhat mollified by the spectacular panorama of surrounding peaks, clouds over Seattle, and distant Olympics.\
\
Carla, Gabriel, Aric and I headed out this Sunday up the Mountain Loop with plans to scramble Gothic Peak.  The inversion was in full force - after a cold, shivering walk from the car to trailhead (stupid gate) we started cooking once we emerged from the forest.  Snow was a bit sloppy and my route finding sloppier, which put us at the north end of Foggy Lake around noon rather than farther down the basin.  Deciding that Gothic looked too far away and Del Campo invitingly close, we decided to give it a go.  \
\
Del Campo in the winter has the tendency to suck you into thinking you're going to summit before punching you in the gut, stealing your wallet, and making you turn away empty handed.  The rock scramble from the top of the talus field was pleasant (warm, rough granite) and the ridge blanketed in pleasantly deep snow.  Aric led the way, kick stepping in fine form.  Only a 100' below the summit - we're totally going to make it!  And then the snow starts to harden up.  Ok, no problem, we can still kick step and the axe placements feel solid.  And then the snow starts to soften over granite slabs.  Hmm...  don't trust my feet.  can't do anything with my axe.  Deciding that perhaps we'd had enough peril for one day, we backed down, vowing to return later in the winter when the snow might actually be useful.\
\
Bright moonlight guided us back to the car.  9 hours round trip.  12 (?) miles.  4000'.  Powdery snow/sloppy snow/wind slabs.  Nice boot track up there for anyone going for Del Campo in the next few days.\

,"Forgotten, or was it?  I can't recall.","In probably the prompest tr ever, here is some verbage and photoage.\
\
We met at the Burke before the sun woke up and got into two cars.  One was piloted by Lindsay and passengered by Dan, Jim, and Stephanie.  The other car was piloted by Mal and passengered by me, Gary, and Ben.  We instructed the cars to go to a place called the Mountaindy Loop Way because that's where the mountains are.  The cars were scared of the snow and tried to jump off the road into the forest, but we eventually got to a trailhead where hikers go.  We were hikers.\
\
We went up relative to sea level, but for the most part obeyed Newton's Laws in terms of the ground.  \

It turns out the red-gaiter kids and the black-gaiter kids are natural enemies, like Scots and other Scots.  I hear the red-gaiter kids were raised by donkeys.\

We got back to the cars after the sun went to bed again, which was fine by me because all eight of us could have lived comfortably in our snow palace for a week or two, but I was running out of goat cheese and had to get back to town to spray on the board anyway.  Before you say anything about goat cheese being gross, you first have to experience the joy of being in a car with Gary while he takes his boots off, rolls down the window and wrings his socks out.  \

Thanks Lindsay for organizing and Brian for hooking me up with some snowshoes."
,"Sahale attempt, Lake Diablo success","So I guess this trip report is a little late, but Lisa and I were engaged a few weeks ago!  Here's the story:

My original plan was to propose on the summit of Sahale Peak, a mountain in the heart of the beautiful North Cascades.  A week before I got a ring made up at a place called LT Dennys (this is the best place to go, don't go anywhere else!!!).  The ring was pretty sweet.  Anyway, on proposal day up in the cascades, the views were awesome as usual.  But, the sun reflecting off the snow was hot and blinding, and the avalanches we saw added stress to the day.  So I decided to postpone the proposal, probably until several weeks later.  Regardless, we enjoyed the rest of the day, stopping at a beautiful pass for a nap, and then skiing down to the car.

The next day we decided to be tourists.  Walking along the shores of Lake Diablo on a spectacular, sunny day, I spotted the perfect spot for a proposal.  I decided to seize the moment.  With the stoney sentinels of Colonial and Pyramid peaks standing as silent, yet majestic witnesses, I went down on one knee and proposed to Lisa.  Although the proposal wasn't a complete surprise, it was a great moment, when our commitment to each other became more real. We are so thankful to have been blessed by knowing each other! It is such a tangible and beautiful embodiment, reminder, and illustration of God's love for us.

,"Alpental Skiing-Related Activities","Ben Kunz, Kevin Steffa, Joshua Stern, and I went to Snoqualmie Pass this past Saturday with the idea of skiing the north bowl of Snoqualmie Mtn.  We started up the summer trail to Snow Lake and tried to find the Phantom Descent, which gives access through the cliffs to the mountain we sought.  We're normally [i:2wsmoty8]super[/i:2wsmoty8] good at routefinding, but we decided to mix it up a bit and flail around in the woods for a while.  Eventually, we all split up and I found the steep slope leading upwards, just left of an icy clearing.  It took a while to gather our scattered group, by which time Mr. Matt Peters appeared, scraping his way down the secret forest passage.  After talking conditions with Matt, we gave up our original idea and headed for Chair Peak, where there was bound to be some light pow.  Well, at least something better than the crusty sunbaked stuff so far.\
\
Back down the Snow Lake trail, until Ben spotted a track leading in an upward arc toward, we thought, the saddle above the lake.  Being unusually skilled at navigation, we knew this was the right way just by looking at it.  Hours later, we were still very much enjoying the steep traversing through trees.  It was probably 2pm as we gazed expectantly upvalley toward our destination:\
\
[img:2wsmoty8]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/34/72964322_461254da36&#46;jpg?v=0[/img:2wsmoty8]\
\
Even though there was [i:2wsmoty8]plenty[/i:2wsmoty8] of time left to skin up to Chair and schralp some pow, we leisurely fell into a few more tree wells and moats, slipped backwards down the steep skin track, crossed a sketchy chute or two, and found a spot to sit and take tea.  Ben, Josh, and I were complete jackasses by this point and we're sure we offended Kevin several times.  Ben offered to put his ass in a wide range of places and we told him he should \""go aggro on that kicker\"" instead.  He opted out of the kicker and instead took the only run of the day, down to the Snow Lake trail.\
\
The trail back to the car was easy travel.  We expressed our relief that we had not taken it on the way up, for otherwise we clearly wouldn't have gotten the fully shitty experience.\
\
There was a lot of ice in the valley, more than I ever remember seeing:\

\
Guye Peak was lookin' pretty good.  So good, in fact, that Ben and I went back the next day to climb it using our now-honed postholing skillz (stay tuned for a TR).\

"Guye-peak","Guye Peak, NW Gully, 12/11/2005","Ben Kunzo and I climbed the obvious gully on the NW shoulder of Guye Peak last Sunday, after eyeing it the day before.  There's a ton of ice in the Alpental area now, so you're a dork if you don't climb some of it.\
\
We are dorks anyway, since we picked a route that required endless postholing—with snowshoes—to reach.  But we were rewarded with a better-than-expected climb, with three short ice steps and not too much wallowing in between.  \
\
Ben dug a ridiculous T-slot for a picket for the first belay.  His whole upper body seemed to disappear into the hole he dug in the powder.  I guess he needed something to do while I fiddled around with my sharp pointy things, getting ready to lead; the picket wouldn't have held much.  But the climbing was fun right away and I found a perfect baby angle placement for the first belay 100' up.\
\
We simulclimbed two more pitches after that.  The icy part of pitch two was short but steeper than the last.  The third was pretty satisfying WI2 and styrofoam, followed by a sketchy bit of thin ice over powder.  From there, the angle kicked back and we tried to follow the thickest part of the squeaky crust, but broke through into the powder a lot.  A sweet tree move got us to the end of the gully and more snowshoe slogging.\
\
We skipped the summit since we had no desire to continue wallowing and found someone's boot track down to the car from Cave Ridge.\
\
If you go to climb this route (and you should), bring 3 or 4 ice screws 17cm or shorter, a baby angle and a knifeblade, and maybe 2 pickets if you're into that sort of thing.  Make sure the second actually has a hammer so he can clean those pins, too <!-- s:roll: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_rolleyes.gif\"" alt=\"":roll:\"" title=\""Rolling Eyes\"" /><!-- s:roll: -->.  There's not much rock gear other than pins, though Ben made a pretty creative nut placement.\

"Marble-peak","Marble Peak","December 15, 2005\
\
Marble Peak 5160+\
\
A friend of mine and I headed out to the Mtn. Loop toward Silverton for a climb of Marble Peak. We parked one mile past the Marten Creek trail where the road is close to the Stillaguamish River. We then crossed the river. I crossed in hip boots since the water was only about 2ft deep. I was certainly glad I didn’t have to get wet as it was like 25degrees outside. We then began the ascent up Marble’s northeast ridge, west of Marble Gulch. Getting started at such a low elevation meant some strenuous climbing over deadfall. The distance on the map indicates about 1.7miles to the top, but with 3700ft of gain it is a good workout. There is very little snow and the ridge was barren for much of the climb. We had brought snowshoes but never put them on. After some maneuvering up the last bit to the summit we enjoyed the views. We descended a slightly different way. This lead us across as steep snow slope and because of the lack of snow our ice axes were of hitting rock. I was a bit hesitant, but took it very slow to make sure every foot placement was secure. The rest of the decent went well. We had a good time, and it was nice to get out and enjoy the mountains after finals. Trip time was 8hours.\

,"Gaperz on Ice","After hearing DadO talk about ice climbing last night, we decided we had to find some phatty sickness at Alpental.\

Barry, Ben, and I showed up early, while Dan, Josh, and Ralph opted for the noon schedule.  \

We found two routes, each about a full 60m of WI2+/3- ground.  \

Went with Gabriel, Bruno, and Carla to Mineral Butte.  The road in was driveable until the last 2-3 miles (but the road goes like halfway to the top so...).  There was lots of wet heavy new snow.\

,"drytooling is dumb","What could possibly be more stupid than climbing crummy rock with sharp things on your hands and feet, which increase the risk of injury and decrease the tactile sensitivity, in the dark and rain?\
\
Somehow there is something appealing about it.  Especially when it's only as far as X15.  Get off I-90 onto 900 and go a few miles south until there's a small bluff on the right and a topsoil/gravel quarry on the left.  There's a small pullout for 3-4 cars to park and a sign saying something about Squaw and Cougar.  There are bolted anchors up top and even some bolts for those even dumber to lead it.\
\
Things I noticed:\
\
It's a totally different way of thinking from rock climbing.  You can't see what you're hooking.  You can't exert any force on the edge except downward.  It's scary as shit when you hear metal on rock sliding, either on your hands or feet.  It's kind of cool if someone falls in the dark, lights up the cliff with sparks, and doesn't get hurt.  Mantles are really hard if there's no snow/ice/frozen moss to whack.  Leashes can get in the way when shifting from a low grip to a high grip or even an inverted steinpull."

,"the non-secret secret spot","Brian, Justin, Sam, David, and myself had an awesome day of ski/snowboard touring yesterday... We headed up a lump along I-90, and I'm still amazed how these \""lumps\"" can become full-day strenuous trips in the winter time. The snow coverage down low was rather poor, and it seemed to be melting fast, even at 8:30 am. Up a little higher we did some serious and desperate bushwacking, which constantly had me wondering how/where the hell we are going to get down. Justin kept promising us a juicy wide open bowl, but Brian and I sometimes wondered when was a good time to stop believing him. Eventually the trees thinned out, and the bowl, believe it or not, appeared out of the fog! Indeed, it looked juicy. Parts of it too juicy for the current snowpack... We had lunch on a ridge and were passed by a group of 8 skiers, who were wise enough to leave seattle late enough to have someone (i.e. us) break trail in the deep snow all the way up. We hoped they would return the favor by pushing it to the top, but they didn't... we did a quick run into the bowl to get a taste of what was coming... returned back to the ridge, another run to the back side, returned to the ridge, gunned it for the top of the bowl... and had a very very sweet descent... the snow was a bit heavy but, as always, if felt great carving through the untracked slopes (I pitty the piste-skiing fool...)... The bliss ended quickly - we found ourselves stranded on some of the crappiest snow I have ever seen in between two creek beds. It was already getting dark, so we decided it might be better to continue on foot... Brian and I were snowshoeing and I had a headlamp so we teamed up and ran down the deep white concrete. We made it back to the car at 6:15, put on some dry clothes, and waited for the others... Justin appeared out of the darkness headlamp-free, and very excited about his night trail-finding skills. Sam and David appeared a short while later. We concluded the day with some delicious chinese food in issaquah.. it's on a corner on the main street - highly recommended!! All in all, a great day out in the lumps above I-90... (Brian and I took a few photos and hopefully they will make it up here eventually...)"
,"The Matt Peters Pre-Memorial Ski Tour","A crew of six skinned up, over, and out to a super-secret powder stash last Saturday to enjoy one last (or first, in my case) BC ski trip with Dr. Matt Peters before he left for the wilds of Boston.  Bombs echoed around the valley as we broke trail through promising drifts of soft snow, passing a bewildered pair of outdoorsmen in bivy sacks on the trail.  A few miles later, Phil Higuera and everyone's favorite snowplow, John Mauro, laid a perfect skin track up between two pristine open runs.  We alternated sides, taking three laps in deep powder.  Face shots all around, mostly earned the hard way by yours truly.  Eventually, it got late and even Dan \""Man Sweater\"" Perrakis expressed discomfort with the cold and damp.  Unfortunately, I don't have photos of Josh Stern hanging upside down from a tree, but a few images can be found here:\

,"Unexpected Snoqualmie Pass Ski Tour","Josh(ua) Stern and I skied at Alpental yesterday.  Normally this kind of thing is not worthy of a trip report, but this time was... different.  After destroying our leg muscles with non-stop runs down International in ever more wintry conditions and deepening powder, we schlepped over to the shuttle stop.  You see, certain people, namely me, had set the alarm for \""PM\"" rather than \""AM\"
,"Snow School '06","I'll save the reminiscences, stories, and photos for others to post.  I just wanted to thank everyone who donated their time, skillz, and gear (including cars) to the cause.  The primary organizers (who made special accomodations for folks) Gary, Eric, and Jim.  The primary instructors Ben, Jim, and Ted.  Sorry if I forgot anyone, I didn't see everything that went down behind the scenes and I also didn't see everything that went down with all of the groups today. \

Remember, these folks aren't paid guides/instructors so they don't get compensated for their time or wear and tear on their gear.  They are just other students with too much to do with too little time and money.  \

"Trappers-peak","Trappers Peak - 6/14/09","On Sunday, Kurt, Brian D., Amittai, Michelle, Maki, and I climbed Trappers Peak in NCNP. 

The road in the the trailhead was a bit rough, but much preferable to [url=http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/climb/forum/viewtopic&#46;php?f=35&amp;t=4044:37ohm8mp]walking[/url:37ohm8mp], which some idiots tried back in January of 2008. A passenger car could probably make it without scraping if driving very slowly on some of the steep bits where the road appears to double as a creek bed during part of the year.

From the trailhead at 2500', the route contours around the Thorton Creek drainage on an old logging road. All creek crossings are feasible with waterproof boots and good balance (moderate log down across Thorton Creek). Along the logging road, there were multiple trees where the bottom 2' of bark had been completely removed. We puzzled about this, until finding one with clear, small claw marks. Apparently, these are being used by bear cubs to sharpen their claws. Unfortunately (?), we did not see any particularly cute cubs, angry mothers, or porcupines. We did see a very large culvert, but it appears that Thorton Creek has since grown tired of it and carved a new channel further west.

At ~3200', the road ends and the trail begins. Interestingly, this trail is not an original construction of the Park Service, but rather a fisherman's trail to Thorton Lake that was improved by the Park Service for wider use. The trail is quite pleasant and winds up through open forest with occasional peak-a-boo glimpses of Teebone Ridge. We encountered solid snow in the meadows at 4200', but were able to find the trail on the other side and follow it in fits and starts to the saddle at 5000', where we finally started to get some good (albeit cloudy above 6500') views. 

The route up to Thorton Peak is a scrambly climber's trail. Partially melted out. Nothing harder than class 2. Ice axes were nice to have for the final snowfield. Beautiful views of Thorton Lakes from the top (lower Thorton just starting to melt around the edges) and glimpses of the Pickets. However, only The Barrier was out of the clouds for very long. Other views of the Colonial Glacier terminus, but the Snowfield group was also pretty well socked in. In fact, aside from the giant sucker hole overhead, the North Cascades were pretty socked in yesterday. After a long break, we sauntered back down the ridge and back to the cars.

The technical crux of the trip was definitely my laughable attempts to locate La Hacienda in Arlington (after an aborted run to the Pizza Factory) that found us driving around rotaries and through the back alleys of Arlington to reach a restaurant that was across the street. Apparently my success with route finding in the alpine has resulted in a complete failure to navigate more urban settings. Also notable were Kurt's attempts to nonchalantly hide the fact that he wasn't wearing shoes in a restaurant. 

Good times on a fun hike.

"Chair-peak","Chair NEB","Well after hearing a lot of people interested in this climb, I figured it must be pretty good so I skipped yesterday to head out with Jim.\
\
A firm boot pack went all the way to the base, the snow was hard and getting in and out was a breeze.\
\
THe first pitch was scary, I put in no pro for the whole rope length besides a psychological picket at the very start, I spend ~50 minutes on the pitch, backtracking, digging with frozen hands, looking for spots for small nuts, to no avail.\
The upper step was fun although a bit hollow on the part I went up, looked better to the right.  We were lucky enough to be the first to make tracks on the NEB so it still felt kinda solitudinous.\

"Mount-rainier","Camp Muir!","Saturday afternoon my sister, Katie, and I headed down to Tacoma to meet some friends, enjoy good food, a few rounds of pool, and discuss our upcoming trip up Emmons Glacier the end of July.  After a solid night's sleep, six of us hit the road at 6 and were at Paradise around 8:15.  The trail was decently wanded from Paradise, but mainly trompled by thousands through slush.  It was a quick trip to Pebble Creek, since we were able to bypass most switchbacks and took the direct approach.  We had perfect weather, despite the iffy forecast, and it was hot and sunny most of the day.  The Muir Snowfield wasn't as crowded as we expected, probably the forecast scared off the hoards, but there were a fair number of skiers, snowboarders, dayhikers, and climbers.  I put on crampons for awhile since I hadn't worn them before and wanted to try them out; they were completely unnecessary, but I'd like to think helped get a grip in the slush.  <!-- s8) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cool.gif\"" alt=\""8)\"" title=\""Cool\"" /><!-- s8) -->  I was really happy with how they fit and were easy to walk in.  We stopped for a snack break about 1/4 up the snowfield and enjoyed the awesome view across the clouds to Adams.  We were up in a little under 5 hours, including 2 very comfortable snack stops.  
The next stop was Camp Muir, Katie and I were feeling great, a few in our group were a little light-headed but we were all happy!  After looking around a bit and a leisurely lunch, we headed down, dropping 3000 ft. in the first hour, then hitting the clouds and slowing down quite a bit.
Paradise was in a cloud, we stretched and hit the road again.  Back in Tacoma we had an awesome spaghetti dinner and good beer <!-- s:drink: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/drinking01.gif\"" alt=\"":drink:\"" title=\""Drinking\"" /><!-- s:drink: --> 
I'm very happy with how the hike went, this was the biggest elevation change I've done in a day and it felt Really Good.  I'm looking forward to the next month of continuing preparation for the summit!

,"Stellar Falls toproping","Super short approach, some guide had put up slings and lockers on trees already, interesting lines (lots of hooking and stemming).

\
Since I don't do much ice climbing, this was most excellent; the approach can't be beaten and the ski patrol asked us to take the chair down instead of walking down. Laziness++\
\
Also, borrowing the Grivel Rambos <!-- s:twisted: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_twisted.gif\"" alt=\"":twisted:\"" title=\""Twisted Evil\"" /><!-- s:twisted: --> was totally worth it; I think it was mostly a sharper angle on the secondary points that made it easier to get more weight on my feet.\
\
I also discovered that having thinner gloves helped a lot with my swing. Dunno why though <!-- s:? --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_confused.gif\"" alt=\"":?\"" title=\""Confused\"" /><!-- s:? --> I think it's cos it gave me more control so I could prevent the pick from swaying side to side as much. Now I understand why all the ice climbing gloves are (relatively) thin. \

Ralph decimates me in the second round of Ro-cham-beau, and starts up the second pitch. It's just snow climbing, but great fun nonetheless:\

Despite losing at rochambeau (damn hyphens were getting tiresome...) I got to lead the very fun 3rd pitch. Starting off:\

\
Man, what a sweet pitch! I slung a couple of trees, found a good pin, got to place a screw in the ice bulge, and happily arrived at the perfect tree belay just above it. Despite the total bumbloid move of only bringing the one 22cm screw (I forgot to take the stubbies from Ralph), I managed to sink it to the hilt in the ice. This is looking down the pitch, as another party contemplates going straight up the thin rocks and verglas (they eventually just went the same way as us anyway):\

\
Way down below, we saw a couple of skiers traverse across the base of the route and eventually ski the face down to Snow lake. Even 2000 feet above them, we could still hear every icy turn they made, and witness a couple of nasty-looking tumbles. Conditions definitely favored climbing over skiing:\

A quick scurry down the warm wet S-facing ridge brought us to a couple of rappels. \""Congratulations, Ralph, on your first ever rappel! Your 'certified rappeller' card is in the mail.\""\

\
The ski/board out was a bit anticlimactic. We all struggled with the tough conditions - alternating bullet ice, breakable crust, and very cut-up sun-warmed slop. Ben did well on his board, while R-dog and I struggled with our skinny boards. Ralph looked good on the one nice bit of corn:\

\
All in all, it was a killer trip! Thanks to the boys for a fine time. We took 10 hours car-to-car, so we sure didn't break any records, but thought we did fine for a bumbly party of 3. Admittedly, the route was kind of stomped out (the signs of heavy traffic were obvious from the past few days), but we didn't let this bother us. Thanks to the dudes behind us (ok, beside us, for the last pitch or so) for putting up with our bumbling antics, taking the summit photo, and letting us rap on their rope. \
\
Gear - 2 thin 60 m ropes, a handful of pins (2 knifeblades used), handful of screws, couple of pickets, bunch of slings (trees); nuts and tricams were brought, but only used for the final (summit) anchor. \

We left the car at 2:15 sunday morning.  There was no ice smears or on avy cone to gain the bowl below the n face so we have to weave a path through the trees through the right.  We more or less followed our noses to the base of the coulior.  Start climbing up 45-60 nerve for awhile.  Till we came to a headwall which we bypassed via an airy steep snow traverse.  We got out the rope a couple hundred feet higher right as it got light to make another steep flutings traverse John's favorite.  Simuled a bit to the base of the Headwall.  Climb it on the left at sketchy wi3.  \

I made quick steps left out of its path but unfortunatly in broke in half 20ft from me and a tv size chuck came and nailed me in the side of the head.  My ear rang alittle but i was otherwise okay.  \

\
The descent licked balls, there really is no other way to say it so I'm going to leave at.  The face is 4000ft so you have to descent 4000ft.\
\
All in all I really enjoyed the route one of my favorites.  Not that technically challenging except for the cornice pitch, which would be really shitty place to fuck up and get hurt.  I would compare it to the triple c on steriods.  both only have two techincal pitches.  But big 4 is stepper so lots of 60 degree simuling on snow, ice, flutings, etc.  And the descent on triple c is like going down a waterslide compared to big 4.  \
\
ps. those to does had sar called on them because they were over due spent the night out.\

"Guye-peak","Improbable Traverse--Guye Peak 6/10/09","Fearful from all the slanderous TR's I'd read about the traverse, this climb turned out to be one of the best trips I've done in a while!

My friend, Cameron, and I unfortunately forgot our cameras, so I'll tell you the short story:

Left the car at 8:30 a.m., had about 1-1.5 hrs of scrambling up the talus slope and &quot;1st pitch&quot; (really fun 4th class/exposed), then once it got a little uncomfortably exposed we did 3 pitches, starting from a big blocky ledge:
1) full 60m rope length up to Lunch Ledge 
2) traverse from Lunch Ledge to the 4th class ramp (5.8--scary exposed, but fun!!!)
3) full rope length up 4th class ramp to tree belay, where we took off our harness and rock shoes, but kept the hard hats on.

Then it's a little scramble to the top (I'm not sure if we went the right way; just below the summit we did some 5th class exposed moves up a left crack system). Summitted about 1:00 p.m, and immediately heard thunder (30% chance of t-storms had been predicted after 11 a.m.) and frantically made our way north over the false summits.  We put our rock shoes back on to shimmy up and over the 2nd false summit (good choice, for my comfort level), and then wore our tennis shoes for the descent on snow slopes (following previous boot tracks) and the climbers trail (when it peeked out from the snow).  We kept following boot tracks from the saddle, which were winding NW through the woods toward Alpental, but as the snow peetered out, I began to question if the thick bushwacking we started doing was actually leading us in an appropriate direction. That's when we finally spotted (and met) Mary and Joan, an alpine duo, who had made the tracks... they had gone up Snoqualmie and been turned back by the sounds of thunder.  BIG UP to those ladies!!! For fearlessly leading back toward the climbers trail. Back to the car about 3.

 We had seen a few rappel stations along the north side of the west face near the summit, overhanging sheer exposure; and finding the climbers trail is hairy; so I can see why the descent can be the challenging part of the trip. Cam and I were wondering if it's a nice descent doing rapps and downclimbing from that north shoulder of the west face; it looks nice from the car.  Maybe we'll try that next time.

Round trip: about 6.5 hours car-to-car
Gear: medium alpine rack. We used everything we had, max of 8 or 9 slings per pitch, and probably could have used a few more small nuts and small cams.  No ice ax. Hiked in and out in tennis shoes. 

I REALLY recommend this climb; it's a great time of year and the area is beautiful. I really like the feel of continuously being on rock, the scrambling up talus or low 5th class, which this whole climb was.  Must be mindful of all hand and foot holds being not guaranteed (slightly loose...), but overall reeeeeally great fun!!!!!  <!-- s:drink: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/drinking01.gif\"" alt=\"":drink:\"" title=\""Drinking\"" /><!-- s:drink: -->"
"Granite-mountain-snoqualmie","Alpental to Granite Mountain, Sunday 2/19/06","Dan mentioned (in Mike's post from Sat.) that we skied from Alpental to Granite on Sunday. It's an excelent tour, and we hit the s-facing slopes of Granite under pretty good (i.e. reasonably soft) conditions ca. 2 pm. \
\
The route we took from Alpental goes through some un-trailed sections of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, and it felt quite remote on Sunday. We saw some interesting animal tracks along the way which a friend later helped identify as wolverine. That's pretty darn cool given the solitude that wolverine require. They're considered \""an enduring symbol of deep wilderness\"". Indeed, \""deep wilderness\"" lies just a short car ride (and hike/ski) away from all of us in Seattle. We're pretty lucky!\

,"Wolverine Tracks","That is really cool about the wolverine tracks. I had noticed those in the same area about a month ago when Justin, Rok, Brian and I went to ski something near Granite Mt. I had passed them off as mountain lion tracks (which creeped the beegeesus out of me at the time) but I am glad to have the species sorted out. Thaks for the ID."
"Mount-kent","NF Kent","After working all day Saturday, I decided that I either needed to get in some people time that evening or go to the mountains on Sunday.  I made some calls, and Ralph was looking for a partner to check out the north face of the obscure Mt. Kent.  We found only one TR on the NF of Kent online, a trip by Dave and Phil that took a bushier line than ours.  Beckey dedicated one sentence to Kent; Krawarik had two.  \
\
Saturday morning Ralph picked me up at 5 AM, and we drove to exit 42.  Our USGS map indicated that the McClellan's Butte trail would put us to the right of Alice Creek when we intersected the Iron Horse trail.  \
\
[img:u6g98fxy]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/Kent/usgs&#46;JPG[/img:u6g98fxy]\
\
So we turned left and marched.  Past Rock Creek.  Past Harris Creek.  Darn well near Carter Creek before we realized that surely we went too far.  We looked back and saw McClellan's Butte get some morning light.  So much for our early start, and good thing it was a cold day.\

(photo by Ralph)\
\
We turned around and hiked back, wondering if we'd ever find the Alice Creek or wondering if it was really another name for Rock Creek.  We didn't see any signs of other roads.  We eventually returned to the initial intersection and decided, why not, to wander the other way for a bit.  Worst case we'd slog up the north gully on McClellan's Butte.  Less than a quarter mile away, we stumbled across Alice Creek and a road branching down from it toward the creek.  Elated, we followed the road down, only to have it dead-end.  So we started shwacking up the creek toward Kent.  Eventually we hit a road, but before then, navigating through clear-cutted timber with minimal snow cover was annoying.  Only later did we really find out what was going on with the trail and the roads:\
\
[img:u6g98fxy]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/Kent/greentrails&#46;JPG[/img:u6g98fxy]\
\
Eventually our nice road curved the other way out of the valley, so we went off-trail climbers-right of the creek.  The snow had a firm crust on it, and we made good time to the basin below the north face.\
\
[img:u6g98fxy]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/Kent/zface&#46;jpg[/img:u6g98fxy]\
\
We aimed for the central gully, which in the above picture, started at the point about 1/3 from the left and top.  On the slog up to the base, a crust about an inch thick would fracture and dinnerplate,  tumbling down and revealing sugar beneath.  The cold temperatures have been having their effect.\

\
Ralph got the first pitch, and he promised he wouldn't pull a NFChair and finish the first pitch on the summit.  The pitch was great ice for half a rope, and it protected well with 13cm screws.  The slope lessened to some nice neve, and at the end of the rope, Ralph set an anchor off a small tree and a pin.\
\
\
[img:u6g98fxy]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/Kent/zpitch1&#46;jpg[/img:u6g98fxy]\

\
The second pitch took me up another step of ice and then some snow until I stretched the rope to dig out a solid tree anchor.\

\
Ralph followed the pitch in style.  \
\
[img:u6g98fxy]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/Kent/zpitch2&#46;jpg[/img:u6g98fxy]\
\
The snow was pretty variable in quality.  Sometimes solid neve/snice.  Sometimes sugar.  Sometimes crust over sugar.  In general it was great for climbing (though you might have to alternate between plunging and dagger frequently or have each hand doing a different style), though the protection was hit-or-miss.  But we did enjoy solid belays.\
\
Ralph's next pitch was a long simul pitch of gentler neve.\
\

\
We were getting high on the mountain, which means closer to the top, but the top still seemed far away.  We were on a large north face.\
\

\
My next pitch featured some more nice neve and ice steps.  \
\
[img:u6g98fxy]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/Kent/zpitch4&#46;jpg[/img:u6g98fxy]\
\
Ralph then led up some gentler slopes in another simuling stretch.  We saw a steep headwall to our right that looked really fun though hard, and we were worried about time.  So Ralph headed left, first through snow, and then some sweet low-angle ice.\
\
[img:u6g98fxy]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/Kent/zpitch5&#46;jpg[/img:u6g98fxy]\
\
But that headwall and blue ice sure looked like fun!  It just looked harder above, with possibly a little mixed action.\
\

\
My next pitch took me up a steep ice step that was unprotectable due to poor ice quality.  I screwed in two stubbies with screamers at the base, each of which had about a third air.  Higher up, the ice had aerated, and often I had to swing several times in an area to find something that would grab.  Keeping most of my weight on my feet was key.  \

The ice gave way to neve, and as the rope went taut, I reached a huge tree.  Ralph's next pitch took him behind a rock buttress where he found water ice and frozen moss that allowed passage.  \

He weaved his way up a ropelength through snow to another tree belay.  I followed, in snow that was becoming increasingly sugary.\

\
My last pitch was started off with a groveling heel hook around a tree I had just slung to pass some sugar that I couldn't seem to get on top of.  Then about twenty feet of ice and frozen moss amidst some bushes and trees.  Finally more steep deep sugar, fluted and interspersed with cliff bands.  I traversed below a band and exited onto easier terrain a little below the summit.  \
\
We scrambled the rest of the way and arrived on the summit with clouds above, but visible were Rainier and a strong red hue to the west.  We quickly cramponed down steep slopes to the east and sidehilled for what seemed like forever to return to the other side of the mountain.  Having figured out all the routefinding puzzles on the way in, we made it out much faster.  \
\
All in all, we were amazed by the quality of the route, especially given the trouble we had in finding it, and the dearth of record of folks climbing it.  We enjoyed nearly 1500 vertical feet of snow and ice, which bomber tree belays along the way.  It was a perfect difficulty -- not a walk in the park, nor holy shit, if I fall we both die.  The route was aesthetic, and I think we found it in nearly perfect conditions.\
\
To cap off a great trip, I then invited Ralph over to enjoy the crockpot that I had cook overnight.  A big roast of beef, with red potatoes, carrots, green beans, celery and onions.  We stuffed ourselves until we burst, and then I pulled out the cheesecake."
,"SCW Ice","Alright, since Mike requested it...\
Saturday: Eric, Cory and I drove 2 hours over to 11worth, hiked 1hr up to Snow Creek Wall across from which we each took 3 laps on the short practice ice.  We then hiked the hour out and drove back to Seattle in heinous traffic conditions.  Topics of conversation included (but were not limited to) squirrels, ejaculation and women named Eileen."
,"06-03-04 : Sahale Arm","(Brian, Justin, Mike, Rok)\
\
Summits are elusive this time of year...  We 4WD'd our way up Cascade River road as far as possible (mile 16 or 17? snow at mile 14 or so) and began skinning at 8 AM.  The day blessed us with 14 or so miles of road skinning under fair skies, interrupted by a detour up to ~7700' on the Sahale Arm.  A more direct ascent put us above treeline in fairly short order, and soon we were cruising up the Arm.\
&lt;br&gt;\
Changing aspects at the toe of the glacier, mike heard a whump and dug a pit.  A couple feet of wind-slab had some weak snow under it.  We were only about 1/2 mile and 1000 feet away from the top of Sahale, but the windslab and late hour (3-4 pm?) convinced us forget about the summit.  We had a nice big run on the arm and down Midas Creek.\

"Mary-s-peak","Mary and Judy","Took a quick day jaunt up to the Teanaway again, and did a loop running the ridge from the Bill-Mary saddle, over to to Judy, and down the Bean Creek trail, back to the trail head.  Swirling clouds limited views to the surrounding peaks, but we made fast time and had a blast.  Perhaps I've never mentioned it, but I love the Teanaway!  This was my 6th trip in a year to the area.

Bob and I got to the trail head around 9am, and as usual, it was packed in with cars already.  Huge group of Mounties milling around, some left before us, one group of about 10 behind.  Got to the creek crossing, and it was running high.  Someone has built a log &quot;bridge&quot; which is passable, with care.  Bob decided to take off his shoes and wade.  We got out ahead of the big group (headed up to Bill) and didn't see them for the rest of the day.  They told us that an even larger group (actually 2) were headed up to Mary and Judy for their scrambling class.  Thought we might catch them, but they went up the other side, so we didn't see them till later.  Trail is melted out until the saddle, made for quick travel.  A quick bite to eat, then up the ridge from the saddle.  All fun class scrambling, and ridge walking.  Was enjoying myself so much that we basically poped out on top.  2 sections of easy class 3, both totally avoidable, but more interesting.  Ate lunch and watched the scrambling groups on Judy.  A bit of groppel fell on us, only enough for intereting conversation.  Took some pics and we were off.  15 min later we were with the masses on Judy, learning to self arrest.  After a quick visit, and a little coversation with the team leaders, we headed back to the ridge low point between the two peaks.  Mounties had been up Sat as well, with more scrambling class field trips.  They had laid down a nice glissade track there, which we took advantage of.  Plunge stepping got us to the end of the snow, then the trail back.  We had a bit of interesting excitement at the Bean Creek crossing, which is worse than the Beverly Creek crossing lower.  Mounties had put up a full hand line.  We decided that we didn't want to wade, so we bashed some brush to a crossing higher up.  I don't recomend this.  Rocks were slick, but the crux was on the other side.  Loose 3rd class brush/dead brush/sand/loose dirt.  After much flailing, we were back on track, and walked out.  Fun, quick trip!  Would have been faster without a collective hour of schinanigans crossing the two creeks.

Note, I would bring some sort of wading shoes if you are going to be crossing the Bean Creek any time soon.  Its probably only half way up my calf, but running quick, and there is just not a good rock/log crossing there.  Far bank is not suggested.

Will fortify with a few pics once I get them out of the camera."
,"Eff","Yesterday, Josh, Scott and I decided to escape the wet rock of the west side of the hill and headed to the Eastern part of our great state.  There was debate about whether we should go to Vantage or Tieton, both had the same weather forecast, so we chose Tieton with its reputation of long lines on quality rock.  \
Upon arrival in cloudy weather, we crossed the bridge to The Bend, where we saw signs that indicted that the area was close due to those damn golden eagles nesting.  As Scott said \""why the hell can't the eagles nest on the chossy cliffs!\"".\
So we chose The Oasis since it was close and supposedly south facing, putting us in the warm sun.  Our dreams of sun were shattered as the clouds really began to close in.  Then the snow started to fall.\
Motivation dropped as the day went on, but we still managed to do most of the bolted lines on the friable rock.  Scott was the only one who dared to test whether or not a bolt would hold (it did) on an .11b that had a super-funky sequence that was nearly impossible to read.\
Good Mexican food in \""The Palm Springs of Washington\"" rounded out a fun (although cold) day.  Banter was of the usual male variety and good beer was had (I highly reccomend the Sierra Nevada Bigfoot barleywine)\

"Jim-hill-mountain","Big Jim Hill, Man-Boys, and Porcupines","Margie, Justin and I climbed Jim Hill Mountain this Sunday via an awesome skin track laid down by a couple of bratty part-time RMI guides. \
\
We started out as big, blundering, nine-person group on Sunday morning. It seemed that nearly everything that could possibly go wrong did. I think this is where someone witty comes up with a Murphy’s Law one-liner. Aiming for Arrowhead Mountain, we parked too soon and ended up at the Lanham Lake Trail instead. I lost my sunglasses on the way up (sorry, no booty, a member of our party recovered them on the way out). One woman had to turn around due to a couple of nasty blisters. Another dude couldn’t keep his snowshoe on due to a faulty heel strap. \
\
Needless to say, I was relieved to set a masochistic pace around noon and leave the rest of the group to their own devices. As mentioned earlier, we followed a convenient ski track up to within about 300 vertical feet of the summit. This enabled Margie and my first successful ascent of 2006 and was greatly appreciated. After some enjoyable 40º step-kicking, Justin and I took turns yodeling our delight from the sub-summit as Margie plugged her ears. We played it safe and elected not to traverse 100 yards of heavily-corniced summit ridge to climb ~20’ to the true summit. \
\
The descent was enlivened by the afore-mentioned RMI brats, who gave Justin a good old-fashioned tongue thrashing for ruining their skin track (at least, as they said, they had good weather – the only positive in their nearly-unsalvageable their day). We grumbled all the way down to the lake about the virtues of mixed-use recreation areas and upbeat attitudes. 2,000’ after leaving the summit we still hadn’t quite cooled down. It wasn’t until we saw a friendly porcupine obliviously tottering down the very same ski track that our spirits lightened. \
\
All in all a wonderful time outdoors. It sure did feel good to get to the top of something again. (Pictures to follow as soon as our friend Dave passes them along to Justin)"

"Mount-shuksan","Shuksan snowshoe attempt","I just got back from a trip up the sulphide with Eric, it was unconsildated wet snow and with 4 miles in on the road we got to ~ 1000' below the sulphide and made camp.  Was totally socked in and snowing really heavy yesterday so we hiked up to the notch where people make camp and then returned to the car mid afternoon, that would be one long ass slog right now.  Also if I know much about avalanches, which I dont, the slopes to traverse to get onto the sulphide look prone to that sort of thing.  Some boring pics to come."
"Long-mountain","If at first you don't suceed, just fail again (Long Mtn)","Two weekends of bluebird skies saw me attempt to climb Long Mountain via Marten Creek off the Mountain Loop Highway.\
\
Last Sunday, Kevin Steffa, Yoav, Elias, and Hitome (?) ascended unbroken powder through beautiful cedar groves (and minimal brush) to the final slopes below the summit.  We turned back about 100' from the top in steadily deteriorating snow conditions, unable to make the transition from snow to semi-pleasant rock.  Not having ice axes certainly made things feel a bit spicier for me.\
\
So, since I'm stubborn, I decided to go back yesterday with axes, shovels, and a clear plan to summit.  And got stopped about 50' higher than the previous week.  Aric and I followed our tracks from the previous week and made rapid progress until ascending the final snow slope, which was just as loose and soft as I remembered.  Unfortunately, now there was a fresh coating of powder on the rocks, further complicating the transition from snow to rock.  On to plan B, ascend sketchy snow slopes.  The clock was ticking now since the sun was starting to warm the slopes and soften the snow.  We made good progress up, until calling it tantalizingly close to easy snow - we would have been traversing some icy sluff over rocks.  Probably could have made it, but were more worried about heading back down the slope once it softened further.  The snowfall that fell off the face and triggered a small surface slide didn't make me feel too good either.  So back down we went.\

,"Dont Take Spring Break for Granite","After getting fucked over royally by the University, I decided it was a good excuse to take my first spring break in the 4 years I've been in grad school at UW.  \
\
Day 1\
On Monday, Ben, Aaron and I met up in Leavenwroth to do some climbing.  I was late leaving the house as usual and 520 traffic sucked, so we didnt meet Ben (who had driven down from Omak) until about 11:30.  After some eating and talking, we decided to climb Condorphamine Addiction.  The approach was snowy and miserable and we had no idea where the \""real\"" trail was.  Still, we made decent time getting to Condor buttress. We started up the climb at about 2:00.  The climbing was really fun and casual, with well protected cruxes throughout.  I led P1-2, Aaron led P3-4, then I led P5-7.  Climbing as a group of three worked out really well and didnt seem too inefficient.  The climb would probably be a little cooler if the pro was mixed, but the line itself is damn fun.  Also, the views from Condor buttress are amazing.\
\
Day 2\
We headed up to the Clem Holler area.  I had wanted to check these crags out for a while, but had never made it up there.  There is a high concentration of multi-star moderates in the area, making for a fun day of climbing.  Definitely worth checking out if you want to climb long single pitches.\
\
Climbs: \
\
Gun Rack (5.9):  Aaron led this sweet climb that pulls a roof on big holds.  The book lists two pitches, but Aaron linked them up.  He didn't bring enough draws, so he was forced improvise and run it out a little.\
\
The Javelin (10-):  Probably the best single pitch I've done in LW.  I took a pretty good size fall at the strenuous crux, but jumped back on to finish it off.  \
\
Ben led a fun and interesting climb that involved some weird stemming/jamming/smearing moves in a flared pod (5.9).\
\
Aaron made a nice lead of a crack and slab climb to the right of Ben's climb.  There is a short but nice finger crack at mid height.  The crux moves were tenuous and thin (10a).\
\
After some navigational errors, Aaron was feeling a little dehydrated so he decided to hang out while Ben and I went and checked out the somewhat recently developed Puzzle Palace.  The rock here is steep and blocky.  Kind of like nevermind but with sticky granite.  We climbed the 10a and the 8+\
\
Day 3\
\
Today we climbed at Castle.  We started on Fault/Catapault, then finished with Angel.  Climbing at Castle was as always awesome and totally different than most LW crags.  The Fault and Catapult were pretty damp, adding to the spiciness.  We checked out the Bone, but it was dripping so we just stuck to Catapult.  The bottom 4ft of angel were buried in snow so we made a rock bridge to keep our shoes dry.  The crux thin crack was hard, but straightforward.  The climbing above was considerably easier, but the pro and routefinding got a little trickier.\
\
Overall, 3 really fun days of cragging.  I definitely need to take these breaks more often.  We saw one other car of climbers in the three days we were there.  Early season in LW is definitely a great time, even if the snowpack limits options a little bit.  \
\
 Ben and Aaron might have some pics too."

,"CA grades etc","The grades in this state are across the board.  Even at the Exits, grades vary dramatically between crags.  This has something to do with the style of the climbs, but also seems to reflect the opinion of the FA.  The only slabby frictiony CA-like area at northbend I know of is maybe the gunshow area.  CA is definitely more than one grade harder than endless bliss (rated 10a in book, but more like <!-- s8) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cool.gif\"" alt=\""8)\"" title=\""Cool\"" /><!-- s8) -->.  A more equal comparison would be squishy bell (10d) just to the right of endless bliss.  Maybe subtract two grades from farside grades to get an idea of LW grades on well bolted climbs.  You are right though, the cruxes on condorphamine could easily be aided.\
\
Regarding angel, if it is a boulder problem, then find a 10- climber to lead it onsight without placing any gear (I know hard climbers do this, but I have also seen good climbers willingly place gear on it).  It is what it is, a nice short crack on a fun route that cruxes early on.  I had bouldered the first moves before, and didnt think they were too hard, just thin.  Comparing leading it partially buried to bouldering the bottom, I felt the crux was placing gear on the shallow hand jam higher up after all the feet were gone.  I will probably climb the crack again sometime, but from my past experience, getting to the stem wasn't that hard.  As for the grade, I'd like to see a couple non-sandbagged routes that are technically harder than this, but rated easier.  10- seemed pretty spot on to me.\
\
Regarding Clem Holler area, the bolted cracks on routes that still suggest/require some gear is pretty strange.  I didn't realize the finger pocket on the pod route was drilled, that is definitely pretty lame and an ethic I dont think really belongs anywhere.  I thought the javelin rocked.  It definitely isnt as good as Godzilla or Princely at Index, but for its length I can't think of many better climbs (plus I thought it was quite a bit harder than say godzilla which has an arguably similar flake).  Unfortuneately I haven't climbed a ton of really great single pitches in LW to compare to.  What are everybody's favorite 9/10 single pitches in L-town?  I want to do Bo-Derek, but that is a long walk for one short pitch.\
\
Dan, based on the guidebook description, location, and aspect, I'd imagine the nuthouse and puzzle palace offered pretty similar climbing.  Definitely cool climbing, but I usually dont go looking for steep sport climbs in LW, so I'd be really surprised if what I thought was the best route there was so exit38esque.  I tend to prefer more aesthetic crack and slab climbs.  Maybe I'm off, but that is how nuthouse looked when we walked by it.  Anyhow, with all this time in calgary, shouldn't you be out in search of fat spring ice rather than messing around on the choss."
"leavenworth-area-climbs","Survivor-style challenge games in Leavenworth","Paul, Kyle, Amanda and I left Seattle just before traffic started up Thursday morning to get to all this \""cool bouldering\"" that they have in Leavenworth. We had no idea that we would be spending a solid 20 minutes leapfrogging pieces of logs to get across an enormous puddle. Actually come to think of it I don't know why Kyle and Amanda didn't just pull off their shoes and walk across; I think it's because the prospect of walking barefoot across a rusty, water-filled tube with sharp pointy objects abound is not a good idea unless you've recently gotten your tetnus shot.\
\
The bouldering was fun; only the second time I've been bouldering outdoors (I previously didn't make a point of doing it but now I think I'll do it more). \
\
Areas visited:\
\
Mad Meadows (I think? fun)\
Forest Land (fun)\
Barney's Rubble (wet)\
Swiftwater (really wet, didn't climb)\
Clamshell Cave (fun)\
\
Areas we attempted to visit:\
\
The Beach (approach was snow-covered with massive puddle on bridge)\
\
I don't really remember what problems we tried, but most of them were really fun except the \""V1\"" at Barney's Rubble which was not V1 but at least V3 and not very fun; I'm not sure why it's rated 4-stars in the \""guidebook\"" although I use that term loosely because apparentl the \""guidebook\"" is an overpriced piece of shit. \
\
At Clamshell Cave Paul found a pretty cool problem that wasn't described in the guidebook. I didn't try it but it looked fun. I finally figured out the sit-start to the crack on The Cube and finished the route. Kyle and Amanda thoroughly enjoyed their first taste of outdoor bouldering. We also made up some cool problems at Mad Meadows (?) and Paul nearly stuck a pretty awkward dyno; we took some pictures that make it look like he did stick it, and that's all that matters, right? <!-- s:wink: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\"" alt=\"":wink:\"" title=\""Wink\"" /><!-- s:wink: -->\
\
All in all I think bouldering in Leavenworth is definitely worth a day trip; there's so much stuff to do that you could probably boulder for 3 days and not send the same problem twice. Maybe even more, looking at the guidebook. The rock was not as sharp as people had made it out to be, although my fingertips are a pretty shiny.\

"Mount-rainier","Mount Rainier- Fuhrer Finger attempt (bis)","I guess it's about time for me to start writing my first trip report after several outings with clubs members.
So after a previous failed attempt to climb Rainier via the Furher Finger, Ian was looking for a new partner to give it a try again. I thought the route was &quot;quite&quot; ambitious with a total elevation of 9000 ft to reach 14410 ft and I suggested to break that in 2 days, sleeping at the Turtle. Ian did much prefer a one day climb.
Being not specially well prepared (I haven't done much ski since I'm in Seattle), I thought of it twice before I eventually decided to join him. The Finger Furher had attracted my attention ever since I arrived and I was regularly looking at the conditions. The last report I read last week said the route won't be in for long, at least to ski down. 
So we eventually left Seattle at 7pm Wednesday. After 40 mn of driving, Ian realized that he had forgotten his GPS which we considered at this time pretty useful to navigate in the dark and considering the fact that Ian had the track from the last attempt. We then decided to come back and get it just to realize that it was in the glove box. Result of the mistake : one and a half hour lost. At least, we wouldn't have to sleep in the car at all and we enjoyed the sunset over Lake Union on I5.
We arrived at Paradise at 11.30 and finally allowed ourselves to take an hour of nap. So we left the parking lot at 12.45 on a quite bright night lighten by the moon. Ian set up a solid pace and I just had to follow him since he knew exactly where we were heading. At one point, on the moraine of the Nisqually glacier, we stopped to check the GPS and see how to climb the Wilson Glacier from his last track. At this time Ian just realized that the track had been deleted and that the device was running out of batteries. Trying to reach a new set of batteries in his backpack, a wind gust just blew Ian's glove. Fortunately, he carried a second pair but this start was kind of promising. After navigating without to much difficulties trough the Wilson Glacier and towards the bottom of the Fuher finger, we eventually reached the bottom of the couloir (10000 ft) at approximately 4.30 am.
I realized then that I had forgotten a Nalgene in the car and we decided to take a break and melt some water before climbing the couloir. Of course, when Ian opened his stove bag, what a surprise that it didn't have a lighter in it. 'This is it', I said to myself but fortunately, a party, who started at from the turtle just ran into us and helped us out with the precious fire maker. We then started to climb again at 5.20 on a good frozen consolidated snow. At approximately 11500 ft, as I was waiting for Ian, a rock just flew past us but this was the only one of the day.
At this time, we were not going especially fast but we were still on time for a 10.00 am summit. We roped up to travel on the Nisqually Glacier and after crossing some obvious crevasses, we reached an endless mellow slope that conducts to the summit. Ian began to feel the effect of altitude at approximately 12500 ft and at 13100 ft and 9.00 am we decided to turn back, knowing that we wouldn't make it to the summit on time. It happened to be a very wise decision as threatening clouds began to appear on the summit and because the snow was almost perfect to ski down. Indeed, the ski on the finger is quite interesting even if some rocks appears at some locations. On the contrary below 8000 ft and because of the heat, the snow was really too mushy to really enjoy it. We finally got back to the car at 11.30 after 8000 feet of elevation and a 10.5 hours trip. The most difficult part of the trip was then ahead of us with a 3 hours car drive to Seattle that I managed to do with a sleepy Ian giving me directions from time to time.
Below are some pictures of the trip

The only problem is that the only routes at index I haven't done are the ones I that scare me or the ones that are too fuckin hard!

"Liberty-mountain","Sufferfest 2006","\""Misery loves company.\""\
\
\""Scattered showers, my ass.\""\
\
\""Well, I haven't endured much suffering in a while.  This is probably character building.\""\
\
On Saturday, Aaron, Dallas, and I made an attempt to climb Liberty Mountain via Marten Creek.  Unless sucess can be measured as the amount of water in your boots at the end of the day, I don't think we could consider the trip a sucess.\
\
We left the trailhead at 7:45 in moderate rain and made good time to the 'end' of the 'maintained' trail in Marten Creek basin.  Rather than cross the creek here as I've done twice before, we followed a set of tracks up river, assuming someone knew more than we did (they didn't).  Bashing through brush in the rain and wallowing in tree wells makes for a slow start and it was with great relief that we finally emerged from the Dark Forest remarkably close to Granite Pass.  We followed snowshoe tracks up the pass and then dropped down a steep snow gully to the pass proper.  \
\
Once over the pass, we caught up with Mike and Don, the pair who we had been following all morning.  Their spirits were flagging and our arrival cheered them up enough to continue on to Liberty, despite the low visibility, wind, and stinging ice.  Both Mike and I continued to be convinced that it would \""clear up\"" any minute.  About 2/3 of the way down into the Clear Creek basin a large wet avalanche came thundering down the slopes to skiiers left.  Big release, moving fast.  Not really confidence inspiring.  The additional ten or so releases we heard as we ascended the forest on the other side of the basin certainly didn't help either.\
\
Around 1:15, we topped out of the ridge trending west towards Liberty.  Props to Aaron for kicking steps up the last several hundred feet.  And in retrospect, we probably picked the worst place in the world to decide to take off snowshoes.  On the ridge, we ate some food and talked about our plans.  The thought was that the summit could be reached in about 3 hours, but that would leave a great deal of the return trip in the dark.  Since our party of five was shivering uncontrollably, and there weren't any views to speak of, we decided to call it and head back. \
\
Climbing the now avalache scoured slopes back to Granite Pass (including slides that covered our tracks from the morning) was about the scariest thing I've ever done.  Exhausted at the pass, I kind of wanted to lie down and as Aaron put it, \""curl up in a fetal position\"".  The rest of the trip was uneventful and the rain even stopped - so we weren't getting any wetter.\
\
Car-to-car: 11 hours.  Might be less miserable in nicer weather and more stable snow conditions.  \
\
To cap the evening off, upon returning to my car, I found my stereo had been ripped out of the dashboard.\
\
Good times."
,"Friday at Little Si","Betsy and I played hooky and went to Lil' Si on Friday.  We could actually park at the trailhead for once and had the walls to ourselves for the whole morning.  Betsy led her first gear route and not a single piece fell out.  Beginner's luck.\

She practiced placing more gear on TR and then we did some sport climbs.  I climbed the offwidth next to Goddess, which was not as off as it looks, especially since you can clip three bolts on the way up.  I dragged my new big-ass cam up with me, but didn't place it.\

"liberty-bell-mountain","Liberty Bell - Beckey Route","On Saturday of the club outing to Mazama, Sylvain Antheaume, Melanie, Sylvain Bofis, Annelisa and I climbed the Beckey Route on the southwest corner of Liberty Bell. 

We left the road around 9 and got to the liberty bell/concord gap at 11. there were already 2 parties on the route, and another on the rappel grapple/overexposure route (2p, 5.<!-- s8) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cool.gif\"" alt=\""8)\"" title=\""Cool\"" /><!-- s8) -->. Unfortunately the party immediately ahead of us, while nice, was slow, and what should have taken at most 3-4 hours base to base took closer to 6. Had we had the place to ourselves I think it would have been fun to climb beckey, rap to the gap, climb rappel grappel, rap to the gap, and then climb the NF of concord, which looked to be about 2 pitches of moderate climbing. Right after we started a party of 8 showed up to climb the beckey route, so at least we got ahead of them.

Overall the climbing was quite easy (5.6, one 5.7 section) and fun. The views, as anyone else who was climbing up in that area on saturday can attest to, were amazing. I think that's probably one of the best routes around for the effort:rewards/views.

Plenty of people, some carrying snowshoes, lol, others looking for conditioning.  Quite an all around pleasant and entertaining day."
,"Temple Ridge, Enchanments","Had a 3 day weekend and decided to head out and play in the Enchanments area. My original plan was to go up and over the ridge and down around Temple lake and out by Snow Lake, but of course things happen. Headed up the snow creek trail around 11:30am, the trail is clear of snow to about 2500', just before reaching the trees below Snowcreek Wall. I saw 2 guys on there way to the base, they had a great day to climb. The snow had a nice firm crust under about an inch or so of soft snow. I carried the snowshoes and never once put them on, didn't need anything for the approach hike. Looks like most of the snow on the upper rock faces has all fallen off, lots of avy debris. I reached Nada Lake in about 4.5 hrs after a slight navigation delay. Once that sun went down the temp dropped all the way to about 20 at sunrise. Started making my brew for the am and ran out of fuel...oops, wrong canister to bring can't exactly melt water for another 1 1/2 days. The firm crust from the day before was even firmer with all the radiation cooling from the clear skies. Made for great hiking up to the meadows and the rest of the way to Temple ridge. My crampons barely broke the crust and I hardly saw my boot track on the way back. Nice sunny day with a quick decent and some time to check out how all the crags looked. There was a group on Careno and two groups on Icicle Buttress, and a few scattered around on a few other crags.\
All in all a nice early season outing."

"White-chuck-mountain","White Chuck: Nasty Northwest","After deciding that the basin was “scoured enough” due to Friday and Saturday’s bright sun and warm temperatures, Jesse, Margie and I gave the Northwest route on White Chuck a go. \
\
[img:2z10nfwa]http&#58;//lh5&#46;google&#46;com/image/coxworth/RknCkr_5JSI/AAAAAAAAAaQ/f_DCHSzG57A/Scoured&#46;jpg?imgmax=512[/img:2z10nfwa]\
\
We started climbing the basin around 11:00. It went quickly, as the snow was still firm. Down low the slope was a moderate 35 degrees or so, but towards the ridge crest the angle leaned back to about 55. \
\
[img:2z10nfwa]http&#58;//lh5&#46;google&#46;com/image/coxworth/RknCkr_5JRI/AAAAAAAAAaI/ideKhJiTeRU/Step&#46;jpg?imgmax=512[/img:2z10nfwa]\
\
We gained the crest about an hour after we started up it. \
\
[img:2z10nfwa]http&#58;//lh4&#46;google&#46;com/image/coxworth/RknCkb_5JQI/AAAAAAAAAaA/g2xH2FZ6GEc/Jesse%20and%20White%20Horse&#46;jpg?imgmax=512[/img:2z10nfwa]\
\
Then the fun began. First we tried to go high, onto the ridge crest proper. \
\
[img:2z10nfwa]http&#58;//lh4&#46;google&#46;com/image/coxworth/RknDPb_5JUI/AAAAAAAAAag/_ccB2lOPcM8/Traverse&#46;jpg?imgmax=512[/img:2z10nfwa]\
\
That went nowhere fast. Margie mis-stepped descending from the crest and decided to hang out while Jesse and I searched for a way to the summit. We traversed down and around a rock band, simul-soloed a few mixed moves and gave up on the low route. At this point everything that could melt, was. \
\
After climbing back up to the starting point, we tried our third and final option. Starting out on a sloping bench, we traversed towards the summit. Jesse led up the 50 degree snow slope and we decided to head for crest (as suggested in Beckey) instead of continuing our angling traverse beneath more than a few gnarly-looking melting flutings. Wrong choice again. Jesse and I topped out only to see the summit about fifty feet higher and two hundred yards further south (high point marked with red arrow). \
\
[img:2z10nfwa]http&#58;//lh4&#46;google&#46;com/image/coxworth/RknDPb_5JWI/AAAAAAAAAaw/0Kcm9T5olIA/Top%20Out&#46;jpg?imgmax=512[/img:2z10nfwa]\
\
Clearly the traverse was the way to the summit, but neither Jesse nor I had any interest in climbing the sketchiest part of the route after turn-around time while it was melting out like a snow cone in a Phoenix summer. I was sick with frustration. I wanted to puke. Jesse didn't feel much better.\
\

\
On the way down, I realized that we'd made the right decision in turning around. This realization made me feel a little better even though we got our butts handed to us by what we thought would be an early season tune-up.\
\
In case anyone's curious, here's a some beta on the early-season route, complete with our route-finding mistakes. \

"Colchuck-peak","Colchuck NBC (4-29-06)","This Friday, Jesse, Margie and I met up with Jesse's buddy Erik Howard on Eightmile Road for a foray up the NBC. The approach went smoothly, since the road was open for 2.5 miles past the gate (and melting [i:yradtp4j]fast[/i:yradtp4j]). I decided to wear Jesse's approach shoes and keep the Trangos dry for Saturday morning. All was going well until one of them worked itself loose and was knocked off by a part of the Mountie Creek bridge. I got a little nervous about the prospect of taking a dip in the creek until... \

\
\
We woke at 3:30am because an atmospheric sciences friend had convinced me that a front was sure to dump on the Stuart Range by 11:00am Saturday. It turns out that the front pretty much just hunkered down over Seattle, but the early wakeup (in addition to Erik's speedy solo ascent and the resultant footsteps) did mean that we were at the top of the couloir by sunrise (~6:30). \
[img:yradtp4j]http&#58;//staff&#46;washington&#46;edu/yezo/Colchuck%20NBC/Down%20NBC&#46;jpg[/img:yradtp4j]\
\
\
Since I hadn't placed any pro in the couloir on account of the bomber snow conditions, each of us having two tools, and Erik's steps, Jesse was pretty unhappy when I gave him the rack so he could lead the West Face. He wanted me to carry it while he led.   \

\
The pack out wasn't as lively as the pack in, but we were all aware of how much longer it would've been if we had tried the route last weekend. We reached the cars by 1:30, sat down at Gustav's by 2:00 and finally got rained on by 4:00 (on the drive back to Seattle). It was a fun, if short, route with a great group of people. \
\
It looks like the NBC will stay in shape for a while to come. We did climb through a few slide gullies in the NBC, so it's probably best to climb the couloir before the sun hits it. If I had to do it again, I'd include 2 pickets, a handful of nuts/hexes, 2 tools, crampons, and leave the ice screws at home."
"Davis-peak","Davis (The Boot skiing's in!)","Well, I've got free time and a few photos so here's a tr.  Saturday morning Jim, Aaron, Brian, and I gathered forces to make an alpinist assault on Skookum Peak.  It turns out we weren't doing this at all.\
\
Jim took us on a rally car fun ride up the Salmon La Sac.  The good designer knows perfection is achieved not when there is nothing to add, but when there is nothing left to remove.  (Yes, I will forego the obvious banana and primate jokes here.)\

\
We saw some kids who like to carry gear.  Probably FMAs: Future Mounties of America.\
\
We walked the road for a ways due to an unexpected loss of the rally car spirit and then walked on a trail.  It was blazing hot under the April sun so we went shirtless for most of the hike.  \
\
We were getting wicked tired before our summit, but then we got some snarfage and we were good to go.  Temperatures dropped, elevation increased, and nipples hardened, but Aaron and I held off on the shirts to the summit of Mt. Davis or Davis Peak or something.\

\
The boot skiing conditions were righteous on the way out.  Personally, I think a good boot ski is about as much fun as a person can legally have on a mountain.\
\
Good times were had by all, but some key opportunities were missed:  we didn't stop at the Brick or the Roslyn Bakery.  There was also sort of an air of disappointment that we somehow managed to make it back to the car hours before dark.  Oh well, there's always next time.\
\
On a side note, Friday afternoon cragging at 38 was sultry.  Less than 24 hrs later, we were encountering snow well below that on the drive home.  Silly nature!"
"Colchuck-peak","Colchuck  NE Couloir","Climb: Colchuck-NE Couloir \
\
Date of Climb: 5/2/2006 \
\
Trip Report: \
Took a little solo trip up into Colchuck Lake area this past Tues/Wed. I couldn't ask for better weather or better conditions. I was able to drive to just below the first trail head and only had about a miles hike to the trail head. 3 hrs from the car I end up at the lake. The boot track to the Stuart Lake/Colchuck Lake trail intersection was hard packed and the boot track to Colchuck Lake went either left or right. I headed right (left wasn't any better coming down) through the trees, and plunge steps, etc. The lake was still pretty frozen over and made the hike to the other end, short and quick. Woke up around 5 from a deep slumber. Temps at night down to about 25 with incredibly clear skies. Everything was a super hard crust, making for a quick climb up the moraine to the couloir base...and then watching as my helmet slide all the way back to camp, oopps. Made short work of the first half, following a decent boot track to the notch (Thanks all you weekend climbers). Took a breather and headed up the rest. The climb feels a little more exposted on NW face, meaders around at the top and then through a shoot to the summit block. Pretty quick climb. The decent down the Colchuck Glacier seemed to take longer....and be harder. The snow was still rock hard, and I either couldn't walk with the crampons or decented a little too fast just sliding.\
Took a long relaxing lunch at camp and hiked out, taking the other wondering boot track out. All-in-all a great trip. Temps during the day were around 60 with a light breeze.\
I've got a few photos\

,"Wanderings Along the Rivers Spokane","Wednesday 5-4-06\
\
Mister Bodenner and myself met up in the northerly reaches of Spokane to enjoy one another's company and the company of a crag. It had been quite a while since I had done either ... expecially the crag part. Ralph claimed he had heard rumours of such that took place before he met me. Further investigation, namely a conversation with Mister Poirier last night, (Poy yay is incorrect for all you who like to pronounce words like they're french or something) revealed I had been craggin as recently as spring of 2003 at the Pearly Gates. This was comforting. \
\
After 3-4 hours of preparation we were finally ready to go; this was gonna be a big day. Ralph could have driven to the local Taco Bell to fight the hunger battle. But no, instead he made the patented PB&J alpine treat. After acquiring a shirt (we weren't planning on bouldering) we headed out the River. The willow trees are bent heavy with new buds and leaves. Grasses popped out in that velvia green that you swear is pumped up on roids. \
\
Bangin out the approach in a relaxed manner we (Ralph) scanned the rocks for ascent lines, but I'm geting ahead of myself. Immediately upon arrival at la casa de jantz he had been handed the SPL copy of Spokane Area Rock Climbs. Of course I had chosen the most distant set of crags due to their infrequent use, a whoppin 16 mile drive. On the drive Ralph used his time wisely and scanned the guide while I carried on about cultural revolution. By the time we got there I imagine he had memorized the Tum Tum offerings. After a moment in the staging area a short discussion insued as to where to head. I nominated Ralph as the local guide since he had obviously learned more about the climbing in Spokane during the drive than my entire cummulative knowledge. \
\
So there we were, discussing the threat of ticks when Ralph eyed a line I had jokingly referred to as a warmup. I had unfortunately left the Jumars elsewhere and was not hopefull for a semi-free ascent. After applying sunscreen to his face and hands Ralph was off. The start offers a roof crack easily reached with long arms from the only god feet int hsi bit or rock. Higher it leads right and up turning to vertical and allowing an escaped to easier ground. After a cople of aliens weren't doing the job. Up & down, up & up and up & down. Ralph hit it again. At some point here I was pindering the cosmos (or cosmo girls) and Physics brought me back to reality. I felt pride welling up in myself as the semi- attentive belay offered by yours truly held Roo from a ground fall. \
\
This was just enough motivation to go for the send. Ralph sped away, cursing mildly at times and admiring the second steep section of the route. I took the liberty to swap shoes and better tuck my hair under helmet. The sun felt really good. After the words off belay came down I did more pondering and continued to find more things to do after the line, \""you're on belay jon\"" reached me. Well here was my time to flail. And flail I did. I retaught myself how to 'rest' off of one bent arm. This felt surprisingly similar to ice climbing where your arms go numb after a certain point. Some call this pump. It made me think of the good ole days dirt biking, best armpump ever; in fact, best full body workout ever. The crossfit people should totally try it. Wait, I'm getting sidetracked. Here I was grunting and sweating up this seemingly steep route (rock: 65-93 degrees). Much to my own astonishment, and perhaps Ralph's, I made it to the spot where he was seated. This was super. I went so far as to call it fun. He called it 5.9; I laughed and added the A2. We rapped down a diffeent direction next to a corner. I proceeed to tr this after lunch. Then we both did another line of chickenheads to the right of the corner. It received the very fun rating by both of us I believe. \
\
It was time to head to Classic Cracks, a fun looking crag in the book. After \""parking\"" in the ditch we walked under the no trespassing signs to have a look. Ralph really dugn the steep looking crack and rooves above. The a bird flew out and he noticed a nest in the planned line of ascent. We deduced the area does not see much traffic anymore and the no trespassing signs may indeed be more than jokes. A decision was made to save the talk with the landowners for a later date when I head out as a 'local' on my bik and head back for some mountain biking.\
\
That's part two coming right up after the break.\
\
Sorry folks, no photos, I didn't exceed the $5000 equipment minimum. Believe me I tried. In fact this is the reason I had to ferry loads to the crag. Fortunately it was under a 2 minute walk."
"mount shuksan","sulphide ski","Eric Babson and myself took off thursday afternoon to try to beat the weekend weather.  There were annoying patches of snow on the road that stopped our car about a mile short of the trailhead, and the snow was quite intermittent until we got off the old road and headed up the ridge.  We skinned on up to camp at the col to access the sulphide.  \

Crossing one slope caused small slabs to sluff.  We were able to ski down to about 1.5 ni from the trailhead, but it was dangerous through the clearcut with big creek and stump holes popping up unexpectedly in front of us.  We certainly didnt set any speed records, but it was a most enjoyable day with great weather and descent snow conditions."
,"Saturday at Si","This past Saturday Rok, Nick and I headed out to Little Si to clip some bolts.  The parking lot was super full, but luckily we found a spot and hiked up to World Wall I, which was not as crowded as the parking lot would have indicated.  We started on Reptiles (5.9), and then did the 5.10d up to the left on the black rock, I think it is called BLM-5 or something.  I think it is the best 5.10 at Si, anyone who hasn't done it already should do it as soon as possible.  Here are two photos of rock climbing, belayed by Nick:\

\
Next we did Megatherion (5.11b), which is pretty fun, all jugs except for two harder moves.  Following that we moved on to The Bad Guy (5.11c), a really fun climb with some technical moves on nice edges followed by a pumpy steeper section.  Here is a photo of Rok on said route:\
\

\
Finally, we finished with another spin on Abo and then a warm down on Girls in the Gym (5.10c), after which we were all totally worked and happy to hike out and get some dinner.  This was the first time I had climbed at Little Si in almost a year and it was really fun, hopefully I will get back there before another year passes."
"Mount-stuart","Stuart - Ice Cliff Glacier (5/6/06)","The thought arose on Wednesday with the forecast of deteriorating weather. “Well, I can’t do a two day trip because I’ve got a test on Friday. Sunday looks terrible for weather. We could do the ICG in a day.” Jesse, Margie and I wrestled with the idea, coming up with alternative routes in the Entiat, Stuart Range, and elsewhere. When all of our other options were ruled out, we finally committed to climbing the ICG in one push. \
\
Three hours before departure on Friday night, Margie called and said that she was too worn out from work to make it. Dallas, Jesse and myself would be the team, then. We started hiking the road at 3:15am Saturday morning. Snow conditions were pretty good and we made decent time to the turnoff for the cross-country route. After one of us (who’d been on the path twice before) claimed that the already-punched tracks went the wrong way, we proceeded to waste about and hour weaving through half-frozen boulder fields. \
\
We made it to the base of the route after a 4.5 hour approach. It was 8:30am by the time we’d geared and roped up. The route went quickly for the most part. We protected only one section, a sketchy bridge across the bergschrund that took two bomber pickets. By 11:00am we were ¾ of the way up the couloir when it felt like a large man punched me square in the back of my neck. My vision went blurry for an instant and I yelled down slope in time to alert Jesse and Dallas about the baseball-sized rock that had just struck me right below the helmet. Dallas heeded the warning and got out of the way, but the stone managed to hit Jesse right on top of his helmet. He later said that it almost knocked him out, judging from the ringing in his ears. \
\
We climbed fast after that incident. Instead of the cornice option, I elected to make it a mixed finish and climbed up and right out of the couloir. We traversed over to a small weakness with some ratty old slings. I was gassed and Jesse was stoked about the mixed climbing, so he led it (with tons of style to spare). Dallas followed on top rope and I cleaned and came up. We finished the route in roughly 4 hours. Another thirty minutes put us on the summit. On the way, we met a couple of climbers who’d come up the Stuart Glacier Couloir. They told us about the footprints from two guys who’d done the North Ridge on Friday. Amazing. \
\
The Sherpa was in prime condition for downclimbing (i.e., pretty dang firm) and as we descended, the clouds that had been menacing all day finally blew through. We chatted for a while at the moraine with the UWCC team of the 4 who’d be making an attempt on the SGC on Sunday. After Jesse bummed some homemade gu off of Aaron Z, we started the long hike out. With our light packs and the correct trail obvious to us, we managed to make it back to the car with minimal post-holing by 9:00pm, 17 hours and 45 minutes after we’d started."

\
\
All before lunch! We summited at 10:20 and made it back to the car by 2:15. This is definitely a one-day trip. All three of us agreed that the loaded down mounties we met on our descent would not be doing their knees any favors on the way back down. All in all, a gorgeous, if tedious, slog in America's best national park."
,"Deux","The sun still shone high in the sky but there was no time to waste. Ralph had a dinner date with the grandparents again so off we rushed. I almost broke the speed limit along the river. Willows were admired once again and we have even chatted more about cultural revolution. Fortunately there was no guidebook to memorize for this segment of our wanders as I had been breaking the law on these trails for years. In fact they are some of my favoritest running and biking rails in the whole wide world since they're pretty AND close to home. \
\
Completing the required period of regearing we were off. Well it wasn't that simple. There were chains to be lubed, tires to be pumped, clothes and shoes to look for. Reread the first stretch of the morning and you'll get the idea. Pa Jantz was invited just as he completed his second ride of the day. He may be older than me but he's much fitter so I figured he'd be ok in the warm May sun. Truth be told, I noticed him lag at times so those other rides act as great equalizers. Peter wanted to ride and tested himself for a bit on his steed but found his injury was still alive and well. \
\
Once the seat was properly adjusted for MR Roo we were off. Things begin with a climb out of the hood. Soon tacky suburban view homes were left behind and one finds themself in the remnant of a pine forest on the edge of 5 Mile Prairie. This used to be a spectacular place. Continued development from every direction, logging, and fires have taken their toll on the character of the land. But fear not, soon we entered the Little Spokane Natural Area. As can be imagined by some, each stretch of trail contained a story for Ralph's ear or sometimes just the surrounding flora. He witnessed the place of one of my crowing achievements in high school and learned of the guy who's placed logs and sticks over the trail for a decade and a half, possibly more. \
\
Grasses overly dosed on velvia green appeared again. For most of the journey the lazy puffy cumuli were blocked by ponderosas and firs. We weaved around craggies and marshes. Ralph expressed glee in this new activity. It was in fact his first time mountain biking, Well, second actually if you count the time he and Mister Stern headed up to Twin Sisters near the Mountain Baker. There were indeed water bars as Ralph pointed out and I personally know the handicap offered by mister Kunzo's microsoft commuter steed. But this was pure bred single track. The kind that brings a huge smile to your face as you carve through corners and dance on the pedals down the straights. \
\
After mentioning that we needed fake names in case we encountered the Stranger (a title used by one Silvio Savage referring to a generic Ranger) then stating that it was quite rare to see people on these trails we proceeded to run across a couple of runners AND some hikers! I was reeling from the realization that Spokane may have indeed changed more than I thought during my prolonged absence. \
\
Following the trail's waltz with crag and marsh there is a short climb, some rock steps and a drop through towering trees to the jungle near the river. Eventually a meadow is reached. We exited to the road and due to time constraints would head back on said road. First though I had my partners ditch bikes under the bridge and hike a little ways down the river at the Painted Rocks, a combination of ancient and modern folk art. The off width I had spied for Ralph a week earlier eluded me but it was a good walk. \
\
Back on the road we grinded up a hill, each corner led to new retreats from the big city, the ruburbanites of today and hopeful parents of tomorrow's ruling class. CRFDKHBTREAOIYRIUGFDKKKKKKK SKKKREEIGFIFDNKNLKKKK. Yep, the chain on my S-works had found the back side of the rear cassette and spokes. I offered some suggestions then CCRREUWHEWKLHHFOEKKKKK. I came over to provide assistance. Hmmm, the chain was no longer an infinite circle. Without Peter on the ride there was no chain tool in the group, not to mention an extra tube or pump. Good thing we weren't far from civilization. \
\
The time was 29 minutes after 6. This was already after the start of Ralph's dinner date. I raced ahead with hopes of catching my pops. Fortunately he had stopped and was waiting at the next and only crossroad. I asked for some vehicle assistance, the Blue Roo. DJ was off. I headed back and noted my Time ATACs wouldn't be very comfortable for Ralph in his tennies but he was welcome to try. And try he did. Off rode Ralph into the rays of evening sun. This same sun seemed to beat down on me as I plodded up the road at a snails pace. It always amazes me how fast one can go on a bike compared to foot travel, especially that of a walker with a bike in hand. But time stretches when you're awaiting rescue. To my surprise, I made it to the top of the big hill before salvation in the form of a subaru showed up. \
\
I could whine about the rough life my S-works has now, how she's been put out to pasture and now suffers at the hands of folks new to the folds of single track land or the abuses of street riding. But this isn't true. No she doesn't get used as often as she did when she was my primary steed and race bike. She isn't sprinkled with new parts like she once was (when stuff failed). Rather she now receives hand me downs from bikes who are paid more attention. But she likes showing folks the joys of riding or spending time with me on those off occasions when I want a stiff and fast frame to tear through smoother terrain on. One of these days she'll have a chain passing through her cogs again. Her headset will be fresh and she'll once again show others a smile along the Rivers Spokane.\
\
I went to bed happy that night. It had been far too long since I'd been able to exercise. I was nervous about the suspected relapse of a never ending cough. But it never came. This marked the end of a nasty 2 month virus and the start of many new adventures. I had hoped for much more time with Ralph but he had a date with his laptop the next day along with the first part of the following day. We did get together for a few hours on his last afternoon in town. It was another enjoyable jaunt along one of the Rivers Spokane before he headed west again. Mister Bodener, thanks for stopping by. I enjoyed it   <!-- s:D --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\"" alt=\"":D\"" title=\""Very Happy\"" /><!-- s:D -->"
"Malachite-peak","Malachite Peak - 5/14/06","Climbed Malachite Peak with Aric and Dallas on Sunday in outstanding conditions.  It's always nice to get back into the Foss Lakes area this time of year when everything is still covered in a white mantle.\
\
We followed the tracks of another climber who had been up the peak much earlier in the morning and used Mike Collins' excellent beta from his WTA report.\
\
Departed the car at the West Fork Foss trailhead around 9 and were on the summit (in very sloppy snow conditions a bit after 1).  The bridge crossing the Malachite outflow has rather interesting approaches and deproaches at the moment, so we opted to cut cross-country up to the 4400' basin at the foot of Malachite rather than ascending to Malachite Lake.  From the 5800' saddle, we contoured clockwise directly below the cliff bands on Malachite to a flat area west of the summit at ~6000'.  Here we continued clockwise up on snow slopes (though Dallas opted for a short step of mixed climbing to prevent the entire trip from being a snow slog).\
\
The views from the summit were spectacular - the entirety of the Foss Lakes region spread out below us.  (Aric had a camera, so hopefully pictures in a bit).  After lounging on the summit for nearly an hour and doing our best to dry out the waterlogged register we descended what looked like a climber's trail on the back side of the peak, which deposited us right atop the cliff bands that we had skirted on the way in.  After an exposed traverse on some heather, we rounded the peak, got back on route, and descended in good form.\
\
Brought rope, snowshoes, and crampons which stayed attached or in the packs the entire trip.  No rock climbing currently required, though the route is melting out quickly.\
\
Congrats to Dallas for a 10k weekend.\

End note: forgetting to put suntan lotion on the back of your legs is a horrid mistake.  I'm fully paying the price today."

\
I don't have any pictures from the west ridge due to lack of inspiration, crappy composition (belays often out of view of the action), and wanting to move fast.  So here's the description:\
\
After topping out onto the west ridge, Aaron went a little down and around a small tower to the West Ridge Notch.  This was just scrambling, but a little tricky due to thin snow and ice.  We then took crampons off but repeatedly swapped between climbing with and without gloves on.   Then  I went up nice rock and turned to the north side, where I encountered soft snow mostly covering rock, making for tricky climbing.  Though just 4th class or low-5th in the summer, this spooky pitch required a lot of high-stepping and mantling from from the snow to rock.  When the pitch steepened, I turned right back to the crest to belay.\
We topped out from the Stuart Glacier Couloir behind the triangular tower in the foreground.  And it looks like there's a smudge on my lens.  Eff.\
\
[img:3bacjsif]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/SGC/ztower&#46;jpg[/img:3bacjsif]\
\
Aaron then led up pair of cracks (hand and fist) on a slab that took him to another belay on the crest.  I then dropped a little down and crossed the south side until I found something I felt like climbing -- a short but steep step that I recognized when I was up there two years ago with Ania.  But this time I had boots instead of rockshoes, and the top four feet of the crack were choked with ice.  \
\

\
After a lot of cursing and groveling and pulling off a tool, I cleared the bulge.  Aaron took the final pitch to the summit, a finger crack on a slab with a fixed pin.\

\
We were on top, but it was still a long way down.  We frontpointed down sections of steep hard snow going from the summit to the false summit, as well as the top of the Sherpa Glacier Couloir.  The hike out was especially grueling, due to a combination of my residual cough from the flu two weeks ago, the accursed break-a-leg hidden holes on the bootpath, and the general exhaustion / lack of food and water.  I was beyond trashed, and Aaron generously took a few pounds of weight off of me.  We didn't have the energy to drive home that night, so we crashed at the Plains Rest Stop until first light.\

Thanks for a good trip, Aaron!"

,"A Day 4 Parks: Riverside &amp; Minehaha","The weather was warm and spring seemed to be on its way out. Peter was officially, just about, almost, injury free. We headed out for a ride, and this time it wasn't just a run to the 'local trails'. Seeing that my one ride this season was a short one with Ralph the other week I wasn't feeling what I'd call fit. But there's only one way to get there, go tear up those muskles.\
\
Riverside State Park is this long stretch of protected land along the Spokane River. In short it's beautiful and offers oodles of great riding or running trails. The best part is we can leave the house and be on trails after just a half mile of pavement! \
\
The grasses are still lush where protected by those big friendly trees. We were so happy that we almost hugged 'em.\
[img:1s0p5t4u]http&#58;//jonjantz&#46;com/albums/album23/DSC_0061[/img:1s0p5t4u]\
\
\
Commenting on a lack of people (we had yet to see any on the trails) immediately beckoned hikers and I realized things have indeed changed in the area. Two women were hiking the 25 mile trail with their mother who appeared to be well in her 80's! A big happy mother's day to her. Shortly after this we bumped into a couple who had just moved out from Jersey and were estatic to explore more. I gave them pointers for places not to miss. Now normally we drop into Deep Creek Canyon. In fact, I hadn't ridden what we've dubbed as the 'rock trail' in years and years. Hikers who saw us wished us luck. I told 'em things were much better now with suspension. Ha! I had just set myself up to get skooled.\

\
I walked a walk through the steep, tight and ultra rocky spots. Somehow I had decided to leave my seat at climbing height. Maybe it reminded me of the pride I had just experienced making a long technical climb. After the rock trail dumped us at the River we headed back up for some more winding ribbons of E through the forest. \
\
We arrived home a couple hours after heading out. It was an abbreviated loop as we knew that alone would be plenty. It seemed warm out. Fortunately I was very close to home as I emptied my second water bottle. Even more fortunately, we had bumped into what appeared to be a group of Mountaineers hiking one of the trails we were on and all of them seemed quite prepared for the afternoon. I'm sure many spare litres of water could have been coughed up for the CCP. That tired happy feeling filled my body, the year's first multi hour ride was in the books.\
\
The phone rings. \
\""Hey Jon, whatcha doing this afternoon? Want to go climbing?\""\
\""Uhh I just got back from a bike ride and was considering something horizontal. Sure. I thought you were going to be in Montana all weekend.\""\
\""I'm just getting back now.\""\
\""Woooorrd\""\
After a shower and food I was almost off. There was the usual gear to search out and assemble. Around the crack of 4 I called Annie while in transit figuring she'd make it over quickly from Gonzaga. She had mother's day dinner with the fam necessitating a 6pm departure.\
\""How do I get there?\""\
\""Hmmm, head over to SCC, and get on Upriver Drive on the north side of the River, drive towards the Valley.\""\
After putting my harness on, listening to some jams to get in the right state, drinking more water and assessing my early season tan I decided I should call Annie again.\
\""Shgooshw afwsaetho wprrj  made some wrong turns sfadfhtg oafhhwqk here's Upriver Drive.\""\
\""Schweet, see ya in a couple minutes.\""\
\
While attending college in Bozeman, Annie studied photography. She was stoked to play with my camera so the following photos are all hers. In conversation I noted how it always feels hotter than it is in the spring wile my body adjustts to warmer temps. Specifically I mentioned how \""it felt like it was in the 90's while out riding this afternoon.\""\
\""It was almost 90 today.\""\
\""Ok, that makes sense\""\

There are some sweet butt shots I can post too if folks so desire. As an added bonus I told Annie a frightening story just as I was belaying her up her first pitch. This was our first time climbing together so I wanted to get those stories out of the way immediately. Somehow factors like -30 deg temps, skinny ropes iced up like cables and a partner weighing 100 pounds more than me didn't comfort her  <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\"" alt=\"":shock:\"" title=\""Shocked\"" /><!-- s:shock: --> \

,"An Hour to Spare: Minehaha Celebrates Cinco de Mayo","\""You say we have a couple free hours? What to do, hmmm. I know, let's go to Minehaha.\""\
Actually the conversation was quite different from this but one could imagine how this would be fitting as Mine is so close (minutes from downtown) and the approach makes Tum Tum look like an expedition. This fits Henzi's criteria for being able to belay from the car. Well, there are some crags one has to walk to but we didn't get adventurous on this particular day. Ralph had another dinner date with the grandparents and his earthly belongings then was off for Tieton River and the greater Yakima valley. \
\
Situated along the Big River Spokane there is the sound of water rushing through and over Upriver Dam (an aquatic 24 hour fitness for fish) and planes buzzing in and out of Felts Field. Beacon Hill also houses some of the burliest trails in the region. It was these same big rocks that beckoned us.\
\
After doing what some affectionately term hiking we wandered back to the beginning and looked for some beautiful lines to send on the main wall. Instead a dirty little OW was selected. It was my turn to lead something so I slowly but surely inched up the Offwidth to rival Betsy's first climb. Next we scampered up a really fun edgey route. This was super but time was almost up. Ralph raced up something that looked both steep and thin. We headed back to my car at Mountain Goat outfitters and said our goodbyes. Ralph headed South, then West. \

"Mount-rainier","Liberty Ridge Rainier","---Hard to miss a good weather window, and this one had been on my list for some time. \
       ---I picked up Jelte at Shilshole Marina at 6:00 am in my piece of shit black truck and headed out to Rainier. Not much planning involved, came up with the idea the night before, so we stopped at Buckley near Enumclaw and grabbed our food. This mainly consisted of 8 avocadoes, bread, cheese, and a lot of energy bars. \
      ---Entered the park, skidded to a halt, jumped out and gathered our goods. Starting from Isput trailhead, we hiked along the ridge to 7200 ft. When we got to the end of the ridge, where one goes onto the Carbon glacier, we contemplated our options, either carry to Thumb Rock and carry over, or leave camp at 7200, climb and then descend either Liberty Ridge or Emmons Glacier. We opted for the later, both not interested in heavy packs but willing to have a long day. We sat in the sun and watched a team of two climbers go to Thumb Rock. They left our post at 3 pm and set camp at 730 pm. \
     ---That night I realized that I had forgotten one of the Jet Boil fuel canisters in the car, and only brought a partially used one. Real alpine style, short on everything, water, food, and fuel. Great. \
     ---We awoke at 2:30 am at wind gusts, clouds, a little hail and a short water supply. “Should we go?” was the question. “Lets give it a shot.” was the answer. \
     ---Leaving the camp site at 3 am, we headed out to the ridge, crossing the Carbon Glacier. At the base of the ridge we found some water, trickling down a cliff. Water melting at 5 am, it was going to be a warm day. We drank as much as we could, filled up and headed up the wall. \
     ---Getting to Thumb Rock was easy, solid 45 degree snow slopes. No problem. Got there at about 630 am. Had breakfast, avocados on bread and headed up. From here it began to get steeper and harder snow. More front pointing. Still not a problem. At about 12000 ft., it turned to steeper ice. About 55 degrees, but hard ice. So at this point we took out the ice tool and climbed with a mountaineering axe and ice tool. I thought that the ice would stop after the Black pyramid, but it continued at a slightly lower angle for a few hundred feet more. Below the black pyramid, we passed the other team. They left Thumb Rock at 5 am, we left TR at 6:45 am, and caught up with them at about 12,300ft. \
     ---After the Black Pyramid it leveled out a little until we came to the base of Liberty Cap. Here we had to cross two deep crevasses and some how gain access to the top of the cap. One could go left and encounter 200 feet of ice. Or one could go right, encounter a shorter section of ice, and then some steep snow. We opted for the later. Placing one screw on the 70 degree ice, and one picket in the snow we finally gained Liberty Cap after one and a half rope pitches. It was steep, exposed and at about 14000 ft. But it was no problem. \
     ---Had lunch on Liberty Cap at about 1230. Sat around, enjoyed the view and practically only wore a mid weight thermal the entire day. More avocadoes and bread, a little tuna and cheese. \
     ---The descent was going to be more hell than Liberty Ridge. We descended the Emmons Glacier, unroped, to Camp Shurman. From here we went to Camp Curtis, down the Inter Glacier, to St. Elmo’s Pass, across Winthrop Glacier, over Curtis Ridge, to our ridge just east of the Carbon Glacier. It was a 16.5 hour day after getting back to our camp at 6:30 pm. \
     ---If people want to climb this, I would get out soon. The slopes are turning icy and some of the crevasse bridges are breaking. But who knows how the weather will hold. The conditions are good now so go give it a shot. \
     ---If someone can tell me how to post pictures, I can show you a few. We didn’t take that many. Didn’t really feel like pulling out the camera on ice on an exposed route. But there are a few."
"sahale-mountain","Sahale 5-16-06","I decided to skip my one class on Tuesday and enjoy the good weather.  My roommate (Nick) and I took his Westfalia up to mile 21 on Cascade River Road Monday night.  It is gated off there.  We started at about 6am.  There is about 1.5 miles of dry road until we hit snow.  Then we skiied up Cascade Pass and up the Sahale Arm.  It was incredibly warm.  Probably 65 degrees at 8500 ft.  It felt like 80 with the sun and snow.  So the snow was pretty soupy.  Johannesburg was burping down cornices and icefalls all day long.  But the ride down was decent (as far as slush goes).  And we were back to the hike down to the road soon.  Here are few pictures.  The views were definitely nice.\

,"RE: Sahale","nice\
\
I'd tried Sahale the first time super late season one year ('97?) like early Nov? and there were no crevasses on the \""Sahale Glacier\"" even then. This thing is a snowfield. Queen Sloppy Glacier is different though...while its filled in right now (I was up there Sat-Sun super nice skiing) by late season it has some big-though-obvious-yawners.\
\
I think this last time out I came up with perhaps one of the nicest moderate ski tours in the Cascades - that no one really does today afaik -  start Cascade Pass, up the Sahale Arm a bit, contour around onto Quien Sabe glacier (not up-and-over), across Boston Basin, Torment Basin, Roush Creek basin, Eldorado basin, traverse across by the Triad, and get to Hidden Lakes Peak, and out Sibley Pass. It would be a prime overnight trip with no need for ropes or anything other than ski gear and lightweight bivy setup."
"Silver-star-mountain-okanagan","Silver Star Mountain","The trip that almost didn't happen.  Upon arriving at the Klipchuck campground I spoke with numerous individuals who had observed that there was little to no snow on our planned route up Silver Star Mountain.  The three members present at the campground of our four person team who had planned on going, generally concluded that Silver Star seemed to be out as a touring trip and started discussing other options.

By the time Ian arrived after midnight - our Silver Star trip was already in the trash bin.  Ian seems to have been none too pleased about this.  I spoke with him after I got up around 6:30am, and he explained that the conditions were actually what he was expecting and had planned on the trip being more of an alpine ski mountaineering trip than a tour.  After realizing that Ian was really intending to go on an alpine suffer fest, I quickly changed my mind and we soon headed up to the Silver Star Creek trail head.

The trail is clear and obvious from the road (note the 'Silver Star Creek' sign faces West bound traffic only).  Our pace was quick over the early part of the trail in spite of numerous blow downs.  About 1/3 the way in the trail becomes less than obvious due to snow/ice and brush.  We bush whacked toward the East side of the valley and regained the trail in a scree field.  From here on we were generally able to follow the trail.  As we approached the first 'step' coming out of the valley there was enough snow to put our skis on and start skinning.  

[img:3t8d0neb]http&#58;//lh4&#46;ggpht&#46;com/_cmsGJSU3p2s/SiQuxUMe8bI/AAAAAAAACX0/ZJWO7UnFbvM/s576/DSC_1335e&#46;jpg[/img:3t8d0neb]

We decided to take the most direct route up, one of the snow covered creek gullies coming down the head of the valley.  This proved rather interesting as we could hear a raging creek below our skis.  Eventually the slope became too steep and my skinning abilities gave out.  Stowing my skis on my back I booted up the gully.  Ian had a section of snow collapse under him while skinning and lost one of his ski poles to the torrent below.

[img:3t8d0neb]http&#58;//lh6&#46;ggpht&#46;com/_cmsGJSU3p2s/SiQuzDMx1bI/AAAAAAAACX8/xTx79ebP5wY/s400/DSC_1345e&#46;jpg[/img:3t8d0neb]

Upon clearing this section we were both back on our skis and skinning over smooth terrain.  The ascent among the rock outcrops on the upper portion of the mountain was very nice and scenic.  The last 1000'-1500' up to the summit I was constantly fighting to keep my thighs and hamstrings from cramping.  I elected to drop my skis at the base of the last snow slope leading up to the col in an effort to save what energy I had left in my legs.  The snow on the last portion was firm enough to hold my weight, while being soft enough to kick steps.  Once at the col, Ian also left his skis and we scrambled up a short predominantly snow covered slope to the summit.

[img:3t8d0neb]http&#58;//lh3&#46;ggpht&#46;com/_cmsGJSU3p2s/SiQu9KayrkI/AAAAAAAACZE/oZLimhWYtYs/s400/DSC_1377e&#46;jpg[/img:3t8d0neb]

Getting up the final 10' requires what I would consider a very short section of 5th class rock climbing with tremendous exposure.  Fall to your left and it is several thousand feet before you come to a stop on highway 20, or fall to your left and tumble down rocks for 100' back to the col.  As we were both in ski boots we decided it was not worth the risk getting any higher (two slings and a rope is all that would be needed to ascend it safely).

[img:3t8d0neb]http&#58;//lh5&#46;ggpht&#46;com/_cmsGJSU3p2s/SiQu-N6wjLI/AAAAAAAACZI/hLQjHh0ABR4/s576/DSC_1379e&#46;jpg[/img:3t8d0neb]

We relaxed for a while on the summit, taking in the amazing views from Mt. Stewart to deep within Canada.  Every so often we would hear voices carried by the wind, it seems there were other people celebrating summiting on other near by peaks.  After a quick descent back down to the col Ian was back on his skis and descending in fine style.

[img:3t8d0neb]http&#58;//lh6&#46;ggpht&#46;com/_cmsGJSU3p2s/SiQvEcCMkkI/AAAAAAAACZo/JhMWpz72GU8/s576/DSC_1401e&#46;jpg[/img:3t8d0neb]

Unfortunately having absolutely beaten my legs, they had very little strengh left to ski with.  While under the given conditions I felt I could have easily skiied this mountain in fine style, my legs were just too weak.  After my first couple of turns I knew this was going to be a sad display of skiing.  I doubt Silver Star Mountain has ever or will ever been witness to such a pathetic display of wide sweeps and slow snow plows.

[img:3t8d0neb]http&#58;//lh4&#46;ggpht&#46;com/_cmsGJSU3p2s/SiQvLzEMLeI/AAAAAAAACaQ/UCxpZnGxH2w/s576/DSC_1436e&#46;jpg[/img:3t8d0neb]

Moving along, we kept to the East side of the valley and were nearly able to ski all the way back to our stashed gear.  Stowing our ski gear, we were once again in our soaking wet sneakers and heading down the trail back to the truck. 

All in all a very good day in the mountains with a fine partner.

And yes Evan, my legs are burnt and now hurt quite a bit.

"Big-snow-mountain","Big Snow Mountain via Hardscrabble Lakes - 5/20/06","Ben, Aaron, Carla and I climbed Big Snow Mountain yesterday via Hardscrabble Lakes off the Middle Fork Snoqualmie River Road.\
\
The Middle Fork Road is in impressively bad shape past the Dingford trailhead.  Aaron credits his training from jjantz as the inspiration for his icy calm under rocky, dipping, and swampy road conditions.\
\
We parked at a turn-out about 1/2 mile from the Dutch Miller trailhead.  Since it was raining and our brains weren't working, we missed the semi-obvious start to the fisherman's trail and chose instead to bushwhack in fine style up a clearcut.  After flailing around in slide alder and traversing steep, crumbly hillsides, we hit a logging road around 3600' and took that east to Hardscrabble Creek.  I blame Ben for the route finding problems even though Carla and I misinterpreted the route beta and Aaron had actually been up Hardscrabble Creek before.\
\
We picked up a cairned route along Hardscrabble creek and followed it to lower Hardscrabble Lake.  Well, at the time we couldn't tell what it was because we were walking around in a swirling soup of fog and clouds, but we were fairly certain we were at the edge of a large body of water.  Traversing to the left, we kind-of sort-of followed the sound of the outlet and eventually reached upper Hardscrabble Lake.  Here the clouds started clearing, giving us a chance to scout our route.\

\
We chose a gentle slope to a saddle around 6000' and as we climbed the clouds started to clear up.  We could even see the summit!  Almost payback for the sopping wet 'schwack in the morning.\

\
A long, scenic traverse brought us to the summit proper where the intermittent clouds made for beautiful views of the some of the area lakes and peaks.\

\
On the way down, the views just kept improving and we were able to see some of what we had missed in the morning.\

\
On the way out, we were able to follow the fisherman's trail all the way down and felt fairly (all right, really) stupid when we popped out right at our car.\
\
Comment on Ben Long:\
\
Ben is hardcore.  Not only did he swim in the only unthawed patch of Upper Hardscrabble Lake (after walking out to a diving point on the ice in bare feet), he decided to use the hike for strength training.  On the summit, we were happy when he produced some crisp brews from his pack, but then shocked as he removed several gallons of water and a large jar of prunes in some kind of water (which we originally thought was pickled brains).\
\
Route Notes:\
\
The fisherman's trail starts [i:2ql2b5cf]right behind[/i:2ql2b5cf] the pull-out about 50 yards up from the huge decaying tree on the upper Middle Fork road.  Ascending the clearcut is not recommended unless you like suffering and slide alder.  The route is intermittently difficult to follow, but well cairned once you reach the talus field.\
\
The route to the lakes is melting out quickly.  Lots of very weak snowbridges make for postholing fun.  Even more fun when the snowbridge crosses a stream.\
\
Under current conditions this is a long snow slog with some semi-challenging route finding lower down.  Keep Hardscrabble Creek and the lake on your right as you ascend and everything will be fine.  From the upper lake, head to climbers left to the obvious nice gully/slope to the saddle.\
\
Snowshoes and crampons not needed.  Bring an ice axe.\
\
Road Notes:\
\
Middle Fork Road in great condition to Taylor River bridge.  Road to Dingford has a number of minor water dips that would be navigable in anything other than the sort of low-clearance car I drive.\
\
Beyond Dingford, the road is in typically lousy shape.  The mud puddles are nearly non-existent, but the river is running high and currently covering a 50 yard stretch of the road (2-3\"" deep).  Road is very rocky in places and some recent small slides have deposited boulders on the edge of the road bed making things a bit of a squeeze in places.\
\
Stats:\
\
14 (?) miles RT, 4000+' gain.  Not much up and down on this one."
"Silver-star-mountain-okanagan","Silverstar Glacier (mostly) 5-21-06","I'd done this trip about 11 years ago, but had only been up Silverstar Creek once or twice since, during the late season, and thought it would be a nice trip this time of year again on skis. We left Seattle at 7pm and drove up to North Cascades to ski Silverstar. Blue Lake TH is not yet plowed so there is no good car camping there yet, but the viewpoint is plowed, and there is room at Cutthroat TH for a few cars to park off the highway. We camped out in the car at the viewpoint. \
\
Got up in the AM, cooked and brewed, drove to trailhead and pulled on the boots....my eye's went seriously bug-eyed when I realized that my ankle, which is sprained \""but not too bad\"" was swollen and tender enough to be extremely painful with the pressure of a ski boot on. It was one of those moments...we just drove up here ...for nothing? Do we just drive home? \
\
I figured I would try it out and if it got \""more painful\"" I would turn around, so we hit the trail. The first mile through the woods is pretty melted out, then turns to continuous snow along Silverstar Cr for a ways up to the first talus field where you break out of the trees into the upper valley. Hiking uphill didnt bother the ankle all that much. The snow was still very firm when we made our way up the fairly flat valley so we just bootpacked it until we reached the bottom of the first \""hill\"" underneath Clean Break...here I skinned but my wife was having trouble with the snow conditions (still firm) so bootpacked it further. We traversed under Juno Tower towards the Silverstar Glacier proper and got a bit further, but for some reason skinning made the ankle hurt really bad. \
\
There were 5-6 people at Burgundy Col...we were wondering what they were doing up there, as I doubted they were climbing and I had never heard of any real good skiing up that way. Around this time I started getting sharp pains shooting from my foot into my knee with every stride, so I figured my feet were finally talking to me and it was time to bag it. \
\
The ski back down was nice, we kept the skis on all the way to the bottom of that first talus field. Strangly the skiing down didnt bother my ankle one bit. Once we took the skis off and started booting down, that went ok, but the minute we got off snow it started hurting pretty bad, I had to take numerous breaks on the way back to the car the last mile. The weather was turning slowly and by the time we got to the car the showers were on the way. \
\
This will still be a good trip for probably another 2 weeks, but its melting out fast! There is little snow on Clean Break, it will be snow free in another month at most."

,"Alpine Lakes High Route - 5/26 - 5/27/06","Defying predictions of bad weather (which apparently were all too accurate for the Seattle area), Aric and I did the Alpine Lakes High Route (East Fork Foss to West Fork Foss) Friday and Saturday.\
\
After filling up with breakfast at the Sultan Bakery, we parked at the West Fork Foss trailhead and walked back to the East Fork where we shouldered our (heavy) packs and headed up the trail.  First time I'd carried an overnight pack since November and it felt like it.  On the way up to Necklace Valley, we had patches of sun and showers with the occaisional view.  We hit solid snow where the trail traverses an old avy chute, but were able to follow the trail/stream with some success to Jade Lake (still almost totally frozen).  The Necklace Valley cabin is still closed for the season and looking a bit worse for wear than it did this time last year.\
\
[img:10cxqlgo]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/50/154934181_360b8c53d3_m&#46;jpg[/img:10cxqlgo]\
\
From the cabin, we headed up valley and booted our way up the snow covered slopes to the Tank Lakes.  Behind us, the clouds would occaisionally part enough to offer a glimpse of La Bohn Peak.\
\
[img:10cxqlgo]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/60/154934211_c33db641e8_m&#46;jpg[/img:10cxqlgo]\
\
No pictures of the Tanks, but if you'd like to enjoy them the way we did, just hold a white piece of paper about six inches in front of your eyes.  The clouds and the snow combined to give both Aric and I awful problems determining distance and slope.  After wandering across the plateau the clouds parted enough for us to find a reasonable route down and scout the traverse along the side of Iron Cap Mountain.\
\
The traverse from the Tanks to Iron Cap is often considered the crux of the high route in the summer months, but in the spring, when consolidated snow covers the loose talus, the walk is actually quite pleasant.  We rounded the flank of Iron Cap in good order and punched up the northeast ridge to a wide bench at ~5800'.  Here, concerned that we only had a half hour of daylight remaining (it was 8:00), we dug out a campsite and made dinner.  We eventually ran out of functional daylight around 10:00 after vainly trying to will the clouds out of the valley.\
\

\
Conditions during the night were downright wintery, with ~2 inches of new snow and ice on the ground by morning.  We woke to continued clouds and made a quick run up to the summit of Iron Cap (no views to speak of) before breaking down camp and heading down to Iron Cap Lake.  The lake is, rather predictably, frozen.  From Iron Cap Lake, the descent to Chetwoot Lake was straightforward, involving a mix of glissading, walking, and side-hilling.\
\
[img:10cxqlgo]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/50/154934236_1116437320_m&#46;jpg[/img:10cxqlgo] [img:10cxqlgo]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/70/154934257_718574628e_m&#46;jpg[/img:10cxqlgo] [img:10cxqlgo]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/71/154934995_8cf21d64c2_m&#46;jpg[/img:10cxqlgo]\
\
Crossing Chetwoot, we ascended to the basin at 5200' along the approximate path of the summer route and were, briefly, blessed with some bright sunshine through a glorious sucker hole.  Great views of Angeline and Big Heart while the sun lasted - which was most of the way along the ridge separating the two lakes.\

\
The Big Heart outlet was crossed on two rather tenuous snow bridges.  If they break completely, crossing the outlet will be difficult while stream flow remains this high.\
\
[img:10cxqlgo]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/52/154934306_f6372dc5ec_m&#46;jpg[/img:10cxqlgo]\
\
The most frustrating part of the entire traverse came in trying to get from Big Heart to Little Heart Lake.  In the summer, this is simply a matter of following the trail.  In the winter, I'm now 2 for 2 on getting completely turned around and quite lost.  After unpleasant sidehilling, unecessary elevation gain, falling into boulder traps, and some general cursing on both our parts, we reached the shores of Little Heart Lake.\
\
Which was great.  I mean, Little Heart's nearly on top of Trout Lake, and that like a five minute walk from the parking lot.  Right...  The traverse around Copper Lake was painful.  Enough snow to obscure the trail, but not enough to support the weight of a tired hiker.  \""...where you will be cast into the pit of the Almight Sarlac.  In its belly you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a period of a thousand years.\""  That might have been more fun.  We had hoped to pick up a boot track at Little Heart, but could see little sign of recent traffic all the way around Copper.  Which might be because the outflow of Copper's running a little high and the stream crossing is \""sporty\"".  Recommended crossing procedure (from the Copper side):\
1. Praying for dear life, crab walk down the three foot high snow bank above the stream.\
2. When your feet slip (and they will slip), execute a one-foot landing on the only non-submerged rock tip near shore and quickly toss your other foot on another stepping stone before falling in.\
3. Cross the remaining submerged or nearly submerged stepping stones.\
4. Exit up the five foot tall overhung snowbank on the other side using a combination of desperate ice axe belay, desperate high step, and considerable cursing.\
\
[img:10cxqlgo]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/49/154934317_10726b3fa2_m&#46;jpg[/img:10cxqlgo]\
\
If steps 1-4 are properly executed, the rest of the trip down to the parking lot via Trout Lake is actually quite pleasant.  The first crossing of the Foss River is a little interesting since it requires balancing on a long downed tree to get to shore.\
\
All in all, a great trip.  With clear skies the views would have been better, but I'm not sure how I'd feel about parts of the traverse on softer snow.  The slopes around Iron Cap and down to Chetwoot look rather prone to slides.  We really lucked out with the weather.  Other than a period of rather heavy showers on the way up to Necklace Valley, we had only light showers and a sun-break on the second day long enough to scorch Aric and lightly toast me.\
\
Side note: not the trip to break in new boots.  I'd forgotten how much blisters can hurt.\
\
Side note: I swear I can plan trips that don't involve rain and snow slogs.  I'm just apparently a little out of practice this time of year.\

,"Alpine adventures of the Methow sisterhood and me, too","Saturday morning the sistaz (Lindsay and Stephanie) and I headed off into the rain toward the Methow.  A while later we were smelling sage and the rain was more or less done with its thing.  We took advantage of the weather window by stopping at the Twisp Brew Pub to sample the seasonal spice ale and chicken nachos.  Nachos were bomber, but beer was a few specific gravity points short of my approval.  After wandering around town, we stopped at the grocery outpost for rations:  PBR, Big Sky, wine, pie, etc. \
\
Next, we decided to explore the numbering and organizational system of the Forest Service roads for a bit.  By some time in the afternoon we were at a trailhead that was appearantly the right one.  I think it was in the Okanogan National Forest, but to my knowledge, it may just as likely been in Oklahoma.  \
\
We hydrated before departure.  Note:  Under no circumstances do I condone the purchase, sale, or consumption of PBR.\

\
The hike in to wherever we went was interesting as Lindsay portered most of our legit gear, Stephanie worked on sweating out the PBRs, and I remembered why I shouldn't be allowed to take everything that seemed like a good idea at the grocery store.  We followed some trails that may or may not have been the right ones, if there is such a thing.\
\
We saw some Lorax tracks.\

I made some navigational blunders that resulted in climbing a bit of mixed shizzle in a couloir that ended up being a no-go for use as a pass.  We went to the real pass (heinous, posthole, grim, slog action) and the weather started looking spicy.\

We awoke to blue skies and a deer in camp.  More lounging in the sun ensued before we made our way slowly back to civilization.  We stopped for bakery items in Twisp, and coffee and lakeside sun basking in Winthrop.  Then we were really on our way, with the exception of a quick goat cheese safety break and an ice cream stop.\
\
A good time was had by all.  Thanks for the fun weekend ladies.  \

,"Mazama Campout Spring 2009","This weekend 32 club members headed out to Mazama for a beautiful weekend of climbing, hiking, skiing, and eating. Most of us arrived at Klipchuck campground on Friday night to settle in and finalize our plans for Saturday. On Saturday morning people headed out on a variety of trips, which included scrambling Beauty Peak, skiing Silverstar, climbing Burgundy spire, a mellow hike near Washington pass, cragging in Mazama, and other assorted destinations. I'll let others fill you in on the details for their Saturday activities. The trips all went mostly well, and we had lots of happy (sunburned) campers by the evening.

On Saturday night, we had a potluck and stuffed ourselves with pulled pork, potato salad, jumbalaya, sausages, carrot cake, and many other delicious goodies. Also, thanks to Nathan for sending along some of his homebrew! It was very tasty.

On Sunday, most of us headed to Fun Rock for some cragging. We had a pretty strong group this spring, and it was very exciting to see some people who were beginners at the fall campout leading routes or climbing much harder already this spring. Good work, everyone!

Then, unfortunately, we all had to go home. I, for one, can't wait to get back out to Mazama to do some more climbing!"
"Beauty-peak","Beauty Peak (7935') - 5/30/09","On Saturday, Kurt, Dylan, and I scrambled Beauty Peak, a seldom-visited summit on the edge of the Passayten Wilderness.

Our route followed an excellent (though steep) trail to a hunter's camp at 5600' below Scramble Point, then over Scramble Point and along a long ridge out towards Beauty Peak. The scrambling begins at about 7000', at the end of the east-trending ridge from the summit of Beauty. The best route is to generally stay on or near the ridge crest, as there is a lot of loose sidehilling if one tries to traverse lower down. Scrambling is mostly 2nd class on the crest, with lots of opportunities for airy ridge walking and stunning views of the North Cascades peaks and Passayten Wilderness. Our route involved one third class step, but the rock there was very solid and made for some fun scrambling.

The summit was covered by ladybugs (as is the norm this time of year). The highlight of the trip for me was finding the old summit register tucked in amongst the summit cairn. The register is a single piece of paper in a film canister placed in 1978. Since then, we were the 6th party to sign in and the first since 2000. Some familiar peak baggers in the register (see pictures).

After lounging for all too short a time on the summit, we packed up and headed back down, retracing our steps along the ridge and then making the long walk back to Scramble Point. From the hunter's camp, Kurt set a blistering downhill jog and we were back at the car in short order. Good times.

Trip stats: 15 miles RT, 6300'+ gain. Strong work, Kurt and Dylan.  <!-- s:drink: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/drinking01.gif\"" alt=\"":drink:\"" title=\""Drinking\"" /><!-- s:drink: -->

warm sunny weather-- outright cold by the waterfalls-- and good views all around. the snow's receding rapidly; there was barely enough time in between when we hit the snow and when we reached the lake to cool the beer in my pack  (outer pockets with drainage holes are designed to be ice coolers, right? <!-- s:drink2: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/drinking45.gif\"" alt=\"":drink2:\"" title=\""Drinking\"" /><!-- s:drink2: --> )

there isn't much snow at all, but if you step in a tree well (or anywhere off the boot track) you're going to have trouble! it's all really mushy. boots and trekking poles suffice; but i saw a guy with an ice axe lashed to his pack.

anyhow. my back was a little unhappy on the descent, oddly, but otherwise a nice day out... and now... i'm off to the airport!"

Trip Report: \
So it seemed everyone else had rain over the memorial day weekend....luckily we decided that Mon/Tues would be better...sure enough!!\
We headed out from Seattle at around 9am and started our leisure approach around 12. We arrived just below the North Face route at about 4pm. We followed the cat track below the Baker Ski slopes to its end and instead of heading straight down through the clear cut, we tried cutting across the slope higher up, trying to stay on snow. We ran into several stream crossings and increasing steepness, so we just headed down hill through the trees. Eventually we reached the valley bottom and started our slog. Pretty decent snow conditions with only small post holes and fairly easy going. Once we arrived at the 5400-5600 bench below the N Face, the snow was total slush and the visibility dropped to ZERO. Not a good sign we thought, 60+ degrees and super humid air. Hung out, melted water, climbed into our bivy bags, and off to sleep praying for a better day. (Thanks to the guys who dug out the large tent platform over the weekend).\
CLEAR SKIES at 9pm when I stirred in my bivy bag and a temp of 32......looking good. 12am, star filled skies, bright moonlight and 30 degrees....even better.\
We wake up at 4am to a totally different world. Clear skies, snow as hard as rock, and visibility for miles. Time to go.\
Joe and I headed out around 6am after melting more water. We're on the N Face and headed up. Slow moving at first as our legs warm up. I lead us around some breaks and into the ice fall area, and Joe blazes a quick path through the danger area and into safety. We had a few nice moves over some cracks and moats. Just to the right side exit we hit a soft snow patch, little to no purchase with our feet or tools, we go through as quickly as possible. Uneventful, but beautifully exposed climbing to the shoulder. As soon as reaching the shoulder the winds picked up and cooled us off to a bitter cold. The traverse across the top of hanging glacier was easy and short, there was a boot track, but our snow seemed in better conditions than they got. We reached the summit pyramid at about 9:30am, 3.5hrs from camp, not too bad.\
After a brief snack and the thoughts of everyone else being at work we headed up the summit pyramid. It was my second time on the summit so I gave the lead to Joe and we ascended the south gulley. Joe put in an ice screw in one steep, melting out spot and than a nut in a crack just before a short exposed step to the summit. Winds were a consistent 30+mph so we took the standard summit photo, congratulated ourselves and headed down. We simply down climbed, face first, following our tracks down. We met up with a European group of four on their decent from the ridge and they kindly let us pass. They did the Sulphide glacier route.\
Neither of us were entirely sure about the decent route, so we were actaully glad we found the boot track from another group. There was a steep step into the hourglass that we downclimbed face first again. The traverse down was beautiful and uneventful. Once we reached the final decent slope, White Salmon, both our spirits were lifted and crushed at the same time. We still had SO long to go down. It took us forever to decent to the valley. plunge stepping sucked, glissading was out, and following the other boot track was worse (once again, their conditions looked worse). We finally settled on a combination of front pointing and heal kicking as muscle groups tired. \
Once we reached the bottom we got to wittness a few truck size chunks cleave off the hanging glacier for an incredible break time show. The hike across the valley back to the woods was uneventful, besides a few plunge steps and a celebratory gift from Joe.\
Then it turned into a minor hell. We decided to try and traverse the valley the clearcut and head up. It turned into a bushwack through stream crossings on alders and then straight up through the forest. \
Finally reaching the car!!! 12hrs, camp to car\
\
Snow/ice conditions were great on the entire route, with the exception of the short section on the N Face. We came across very few crevasses and passed through high risk areas early enough.\
All in all a great climb. Thanks Joe for picking the mountain\

"Malachite-peak","Malachite Peak - I'd Rather Be Gambling!","Jesse Newman, Jeff Walters and I climbed a burly new route on the South Face of Malachite Peak. Margie summited as well, via the standard scramble route. \
\
The brutally long, 200’+ route, which we dubbed “I’d Rather Be Gambling,” starts in the obvious gully on the South Face of Malachite’s southern-most false summit. The bottom third is class 3 and 4 scrambling on somewhat loose rock. The middle third is characterized by a few very-low 5th class moves through the vegetation-choked gully system. The remainder is composed of relatively solid climbing up to and in a prominent, low angle dihedral. We felt that this section of the climb maxed out around 5.6 or 5.7. \
\
We settled on the route only after checking out a more challenging option on the false summit’s east face. Seeing as Jesse left his harness in the car to “save weight,” and I wasn’t comfortable watching him solo wet mid 5th in boots, we elected to try out the gully that Aaron, Margie and I had given up on two winters ago. Jesse cruised through the lower third and thrashed through the middle section while I belayed Margie and Jeff up the lower portion. Margie decided after the first tree-obstruction that the veggies and friable rock weren’t aesthetic enough for her and down climbed, choosing to go solo on the scramble route instead. \
\
After Jeff negotiated the “green” section, we brought Margie’s harness to Jesse and he led up the classy, though loose, dihedral. The start of this 80’ pitch involves a few desperate (in boots) moves on an awkward flake in order to access a brilliant hand crack – a crack which almost makes the hellish thrashing down below worth it. After forty or fifty feet of smooth hand jams, the route ends on the SW flank of the false summit. The true summit is a relatively brush-free, 10 minute scramble on the SE ridge. \
\
Met up with Margie on the summit at 4:55, signed the register, and headed down to the car by 5:30. We arrived at the car around 8:30, 11 hours after starting out.\

"Mount-baker","Mt. Baker - Easton Glacier 6-6-06","My senoritis is reaching it's worst (or best).  Looking at the weather Tuesday looked like the best day to get out.  Wednesday and Thursday I have finals!  So I talked to Justin and Nick (my roommate), and we decided to get some skiing in on Mt. Baker.  A few weeks ago we did the Coleman-Deming route, so this time we opted for the Easton glacier.  We started from the car at ~4am.  We actually ran into snow just a little before the trailhead at about 3000 ft!  We were able to skin from the trailhead all the way to the base of the Roman Wall.  We cramponed up the Roman Wall.  It was icy, but warming quickly.  We reached the top at about 11:30am.  It was cold on the summit from some wind so we didn't linger long.  Justin and I cramponed down most of the Roman Wall (with skis on our backs).  Nick skied it with ice axe in hand.  Once we got below the wall the snow was softer and the ski down was great.  I was able to practice my ski turns, which need some work!  The snow down lower turned to mush, which was quite a workout but we were able to ski all the way to the car!  It was a sweet day, and I even think I passed my final this morning!!\
Here are a few pictures...\

Aaaaarrrrgggggg!!!!!!!!!!"
"Forbidden-peak","W Ridge of Forbidden","Justin Evans, Ben Long and I started up Forbidden’s west ridge couloir at half past noon, roughly four hours after beginning the approach. The sun-softened couloir was littered with debris, but Justin led us safely up to a notch where we dumped gear, flaked out the second rope and prepared for the first few pitches. Ben and I had agreed to lead in blocks (this decision may or may not have been influenced by Colin Haley) and it turned out that I got the less-challenging block. \
\
After three leads of mild, fourth class scrambling with a few low-fifth moves, I turned the rack over and Ben charged up the remaining pitches of solid, airy, exposed fifth class. Soon we all sat on the summit, enjoying the views and debating our choices for the descent. In the end, Ben led the simul-down-climb on the thicker of our two ropes, placing pro every so often. Justin followed in the middle, while I cleaned and self-protected (by slinging the route’s innumerable rock horns). We soon arrived at the first of two single rope rappels. We chose to unrope after the second. Our strategy proved quite efficient and we arrived back at the notch after spending only 2.5 hours descending the ridge. \
\
The couloir was more firm and far less intimidating on the way down. We roped up anyway and placed a couple of pickets at the various moats. By the time we stepped off the glacier, the clouds and waning daylight had reduced visibility to a few hundred yards. We all knew we were in for a long hike out. We were not disappointed. Although the trail eluded us only once, the mist and soaking brush made our exit less than enjoyable. In spite of our drenched clothes and packs, our spirits were high when we arrived back at the car around 11:40pm. Ben’s pictures probably tell the story much better than words…"

,"Dodging the rain: Index and Vantage","On Thursday afternoon, Tom, Ruth, and I went to Index, hoping that we'd be able to do some climbing.  On the way up it was drizzling through Sultan and Goldbar, but it let up by the time we got to Index.  The rock was damp, and where sheltered by trees, sopping wet.  We did Princely Ambitions (p1&2 -- aided the wet 5.8+ mantle) and Godzilla (aided the wet bolt ladder, which was drier than the less-protected righthand start).  As we started driving home, torrential rains began.\
\
Late Saturday afternoon, Kevin, Ruth, and I drove to Vantage, having decided that skiing through pea soup in NCNP was not going to be fun.  That evening we did some evening photography -- the desert flowers were nice, including a beautfuil light-purple lily.  Sunday we climbed in sunshine in the morning and mostly clouds in the afternoon (great -- kept the heat down).  We started off on Party in Your Pants and then went over to Ride'Em Cowboy.  Or what I thought was that.  Halfway up, I reached a hard move and cursed, \""There's no f'n way this is 5.9+.\""  I stepped in a sling and continued, because I didn't want to retreat and leave a biner.  In the meantime I found out it was an 11a.  Higher up, there were more hard moves I really wasn't in the mood for, so I climbed a dirty offwidth to the left instead.  Ruth enjoyed following it with a fair amount of hangdogging.  Kevin in the meanwhile was hiking to some sanddunes.  Then we climbed Sensimilla (I got the redpoint this time)  and met up with Kev again.  We then went to the Air Guitar area.  We climbed some juggy \""gym\"" routes (one of which Ruth led), and I led Crossing the Threshold, at first thinking it was Air Guitar or Pony Keg.  I didn't bother to stem at all the whole route, though Ruth and Kev did a lot while following.  Finally I taught Kevin how to jug, and he snapped pictures of me posing while leading Air Guitar.  Ruth got some Nikon time as well.  When we headed home, we again hit tumultous rain.\
\
Mosquitos at both Index and Vantage.  It's a wet May/June."
"index","Index","I went to index with Scott on Sunday.  It was pretty kickass perfect weather.  He led full sagatiurius and I managed to follow cleanly thanks to his efficent footwork sequence.  Then I led the pitch that goes up and right from godzilla to the base of salad fingers.  The pitch was kind of scary as it involved some 5.10 face climbing with potential for a huge whipper!  Then Scott lead the 10d pitch of narrow arrow direct, which is an awesome pitch, right up there with sloe children... I than led the 10b offwidth to the top of narrow arrow.  I hung because i worked myself into a position where i could not move the #5 friend up anymore and wasn't going to run it out to the top.  So unless you have a lot of offwidth skills i would bring two cams of that size.  We finished the day with top rope runs of shirley and that 11b left of thin fingers.  good times"

"Tomyhoi-peak","Tomyhoi Peak - Sunday 6/18","On Sunday, Carla, Jeremy, Jim, Logan (the wonder dog), and I climbed Tomyhoi Peak via Yellow Aster Butte.  Great early season climb - but need to go back and bag the views of the border peaks at some point.\
\
We left Seattle around 7 PM on Saturday evening and rolled into the parking area/bivy site around 10 PM with a quick stop for gas.  The surrounding peaks were totally socked in, but in the morning the sky had cleared enough to give us our only views of Baker for the day.\
\
The Yellow Aster Butte trail is in great shape to the snowline at 4500'.  From here, we crossed the basin to the south of the buttes and regained the mostly snow covered trail on the other side.  From the upper basin, we chose to ascend a wide, snow filled gully that tops out on a saddle just to the east of Yellow Aster Butte.  Here we saw the first of many marmots.  Made a descending traverse to the tarns and picked up the way trail along the wide, meadowed arm leading towards Tomyhoi.\

Views deteriorated considerably around this point and didn't improve until we were on our way back down the arm, but we did have some fleeting views of impressive rock pinacles along the ridge to Tomyhoi.\

\
At the end of the meadowed arm, we descended a climber's path to a wide saddle (looked much more intimidating than it actually was), then followed a climber's path along the ridge all the way to a saddle at 6900'.  As it turns out, it is possible to stay on the ridge for almost the entire distance to Tomyhoi - if the rock is any harder than easy 2nd class, you're off route.  The route generally stays on or to climber's right of the ridge, but there is a short stretch on the left side.  After a short stretch on snow to avoid a large pinacle, we crossed to the left side of the ridge at a 7300' col and followed a scree covered climber's path to the false summit.  Beyond, shrouded in fog, loomed the true summit of Tomyhoi, a craggy looking block with sharp exposure on both sides.  At least we think there's sharp exposure.  The fog and clouds had visibility down to about a 100'.\

\
The ascent of the true summit (as scouted by Logan) is relatively straightforward.  From the col between the false and true summit, ascend a class 3 gully.  The rotue is exposed in some places, but the rock is generally sound and none of our party (Logan included) had any trouble up or down.  At the top of the gully, exit onto a wide scree bench.  Here, mantle/scramble up to a higher bench and pick up the obvious scree climber's trail all the way to the main summit (a few class 3 moves to get on the summit block).\
\
Ours was the first party of the season to sign in and the register left by Fay Pullen in 2002 had weathered the winter quite well and was only slightly damp.  We let it dry out for a while and tried to wait for a clearing, but just got heavily sleeted on the descent for our trouble.\

\
Aside from the rap sling  :paranoid:  we cleared off a horn at the 7300' col (why would anyone be rapping down from there?) the trip out was without incident.  On the way back, rather than traverse back around to Yellow Aster Butte, we picked up the summer trail and managed to follow it in the snow without too much trouble back around to the upper basin.  Nice to have been able to make a loop.\

10 hours car-to-car.  ~4000' net gain (little more with the up and down).  Maybe 14 miles?\

This moves up my list to my favorite scramble in Washington.  Need to go back when the views are better![/img]"
"Mount-rainier","TR - Mount Rainier - Ingraham Direct, 6/24/2006","This TR is also posted on Cascade Climbers:  [url:2jvk4e2n]http&#58;//www&#46;cascadeclimbers&#46;com/threadz/showflat&#46;php/Cat/0/Number/583814/an/0/page/0#583814[/url:2jvk4e2n]\
\
My friend Andrew and I climbed Rainier via Ingraham Direct in just under 12.5 hours roundtrip from Paradise. It was a great climb with nearly perfect weather conditions. The toughest part turned out to be the descent from Camp Muir to Paradise.\
\

\
We arrived at 6 pm yesterday evening to register and rested until our departure, which was just before 11 pm Friday night. The route was virtually entirely snow from parking lot to summit. At 11 pm there was still some light in the sky. As we ascended Muir snowfield, we gazed at the star-filled sky. Temps were still warm and we were sweating like crazy!\
\
We made Camp Muir in reasonable time and pressed onward. It was eerily quiet at Camp Muir because all the parties had already left for the climb. We could see the last couple lights rounding the corner onto the Ingraham, but we knew there were probably many more ahead.\
\

\
We caught up very fast and could see dozens of headlamps lining the DC route. The Ingraham Direct route was a great choice because of it directness and it allowed us to pass the multitudes of people ascending the DC route. We had to jump one large crevasse on the Ingraham Direct. A party just ahead of us had just belayed the crossing, but told us the platform/lip on the other side was solid so we jumped. Furthermore, several snow bridges on the route are weakening and thinning. It definitely looks like the hot spell of late will put the Ingraham Direct route out of commission soon, or at least take the \""direct\"" out of it.\
\

\
We were able to pass all the groups slogging up the DC route which was excellent. I felt great on the upper slopes of the mountain and we arrived at the summit at 6:30 am and then chilled in the crater for over a half an hour. It was a relatively warm and calm summit for Rainier - at least compared to my previous ascents. Not a cloud in the sky and views from Baker near the Canadian Border to Mount Jefferson in central Oregon.\
\
We chose the DC route for descent to avoid the weakening snow bridges on the Ingraham Direct as the sun warmed the slopes. The DC was not very fun to descend and was probably more time consuming than descending Ingraham Direct.\
\

\
The descent went ok untiil we reached the Muir Snowfield. Snow conditions were not conducive for glissading and somebody kicked steps up through existing glissade chutes making them impossible to use and angering me. The descent off the Muir Snowfield, which we thought would be a fun and relaxing glissade, turned into a nightmarish snow slog. In the later stages of this slog I postholed awkwardly resulting in some ligament in my knee tweaking. That put the icing on the cake for my tired legs and the rest of the way down was probably the most difficult part of the climb. I wish we had skis. After what seemed like forever, we arrived at the parking lot at 11:25 am. We weren't trying to force a fast time, but between breaks and slogging (instead of glissading) down Muir Snowfield, there were at least a couple hours that could have been shaved off.\
\
Overall a great climb with a fantastic partner.\
\
Notes: 99% snow-covered from parking lot to summit. If you are planning the DC route, make sure to jump out ahead of the guided groups. Climbers told us that cleaver was a real bottleneck. \

"Mount-baker","Baker - CD route","This weekend, Artie, Brian, Griff, Jonathan, Matthew, Michele and I climbed Mt. Baker via the Coleman-Deming route.  We camped at the trailhead Friday night and set out under blue skies the next morning.  Fording the rivers presented minor challenges due to high flows, but they were passable.  We reached the snowfield at 6000 ft. relatively quickly.  There, we spent time on the snow slopes practicing self arresting.  Since it was still early in the day, we shouldered our packs and headed higher.  We found a great spot at ~6700 ft. with two tent platforms already dug.  There we had lunch, dug a third platform, set up camp, and constructed solar stills to melt snow for water (very affective this weekend).\
\
We headed to a moderate slope to practice crevasse rescue.  I demonstrated building deadmen and anchors in the snow.  Then Griff and I demonstrated building a z-pulley system.  The rest of the afternoon we spent practicing crevasse rescue and z-pulley construction.  Afterwards, we ate dinner, stayed up for sunset, and watched the light on Baker.\
\
We set out from camp at 4:00 AM under clear, warm skies.  We moved very steady pace up the Coleman.  Most of the crevasses were still hidden, but we did cross a couple of snowbridges.  The snow was excellent for crampons.  Our progress came to a grinding halt on the final steep slope to the summit.  One team was moving extremely slowly and everything got really backed up.  Everyone else was willing to willing to wait behind the slow party.  Everyone but the Mountaineers.  Their party decided to walk next to our party, above/on the boot track.  Seeing their poor crampon technique made it scarier.  If they had fallen, they would have definitely taken out both our ropes.  To make matters worse, they crossed over our rope between two members of our party.  I am ok waiting behind a slow party of Mountaineers, but have never seen them so inconsiderate or display such a blatant disregard for safety.  I talked to them about it on the summit, and their excuse was they were getting cold waiting so wanted to get ahead of everyone.  We still reached the summit before them.  \
\
The summit was great, lots of photos, food, naps and views.  We even ran in to Nick B., who had come up the Easton with an AAI group.  We hung out in the sun for over an hour taking it all in before heading down.  The descent was straightforward and good cramponing down the steep section.  The snow became sloppier below.  We packed up and headed back to the cars.\
\
On the way home we stopped at The North Fork Brewery, Pizzeria, Beer Shrine and Wedding Chapel, where we took advantage of everything but the chapel.  It was a great meal to end a fantastic weekend in the mountains.\

Brian will post photos soon."

no move is particulary difficult but it is very overhanging and very pumpy.  The crux is a face move at the very end which wouldn't that hard if you weren't insanely pumped even if your on tr and hang right before it.\
\
To get an idea as to how overhanging it is here is Scott after lowering off, The route starts approximatly 8ft behind me when i take this photo making it overhang by ~ 30ft.\

"Hibox-mountain","Hibox Traverse","Will Wilder and I set out to climb Hibox peak, just east of Snoqualmie pass. From the box canyon (rampart ridge) TH, we followed the nice valley track about 2 miles in, where we found the well-beaten in and flagged climbers trail. It went up at a fairly steep grade, and we quickly entered grassy meadows sprinkled with rock outcrops. Nearing the top, the peak looks like an impregnable fortress, and there was indeed a party attemping a spicy looking coulior, however, a walk around to the right side leads to friendly scrambling!

An incredible aspect on the snoqualmie crest peaks here - all the neat stuff lines up in fine form - chimney rock and the chief framing glacier peak in the distance! At this point, rather than descending the trail directly, we traversed the ridge back toward the trailhead, crossing through a nice meadow at the 'lobox pass'. Here, the crest peaks were framed nicely by the Queens, and a pair of dramatic rock spires lower on box-ridge stood out above the distant reservoir lake. The remaining descent was through old-growth with a scattered vine maple understory. Fall color was just beginning in the maple in open spots, as well as in the high huckleberries.

,"Dragonchuck","The Friday before last Friday I rolled into Leavenworth with plans to meet Ted and Margie for some cragging on Sunday, but I had nothing to do on Saturday.  I bivyed at the Mountaineer Creek trailhead and some loud dudes woke up at about 5:30 am.  I hummed and hawed, ate some brekky, considered my options, and decided to climb Colchuck via whatever route had boot tracks up it.  I got packed and was on the trail by 6:30/7:00.\
\
The trail was snow free to the lake and I made a cramponless ascent of the Colchuck (of course I didn't know that's what it was called) glacier, following previously kicked steps, and topped out at Colchuck col at 10am or maybe 11am or something.\
\
I should mention at this point that I had no map, no route beta, and generally my plan of attack from the beginning was to hike to the lake and go up.\
\
From Colchuck col I climbed a steep, icy col, which was too spicy without crampons and I opted for some mixed climbing instead.  I had no idea where the true summit was so I traversed the ridge and did a sampler of all of the high points.  I climbed a bitchin 5.7ish hand crack on solid granite for one of the spires.\
\
I had the most incredible bootskiing of my life going down from Asgaard pass.  It was wicked fun.\
\
The trip total was something like 9 hours car to car.  \
\
A few days later I got my hands on a map and realized I had climbed Dragontail from the back and not Colchuck.  Dragonchuck was a fun day out and another fine adventure in the Mr. Magoo Alpine Academy."
,"Entiat Walking","Last Friday I bought a map of the Wenatchee National Forest and decided to go for a long walk in said forest.  I went to some campground/ trailhead just down the road from my work bunkhouse digs and got packed.  The forecast for night time lows in the 50s prompted me to take a fleece sleeping bag/blanket thing instead of a real sleeping bag.  I basically took an extra layer and food for 4-5 days with quixotic visions of an Abbeyesque romp through the sage and pondo country.\
\
I started hiking along the Mad River and along some ridges paralleling the river.  It got really hot so I hiked nekked for a bit and cooled down in the river.  I have to say that the birthday suit beats any synthetic fiber for comfort on the trail.  At some point I looked at the map (no topo lines) and decided to hike to the Tyee fire lookout and sleep there.\
\
After some switchbacks and some getting sick of switchbacks and going cross country up the ridge lines, I got to the lookout at 7:30ish pm (I think I left the car at about noon).  I think I did something along the lines of 16 miles for the day, but I'm not really sure.\
\
I caught a sweet sunset with views of the Lake Chelan-Sawtooth area, the Leavenworth area Cascades, and the high desert plateau to the east.  \
\
About the time the Sawtooths took their last bite from the late-setting solstice sun, I began to realize that the forecast for night time lows of 50s was for Wenatchee and the valleys.  I was at 6600something feet where it was a bit chillier.  I scrounged some whitebark pine remnants from the big Tyee fire a few years ago and built myself a little fire.  I slept about a foot away from the fire and woke up frequently to shiver and put more wood on.  When I woke up in the morning I had holes burnt in my stupid fleece sleeping bag thing and my pad.  Oh well.\
\
The next day was a scorcher too.  I wussed out on 3 more nights of shivering and decided to just hike out.  I didn't want to retrace my hike in so I exited via FS roads.  Too much of the road was paved, it was hot, I was sunburned, and a green fly bit my ankle. \
\
That area is really pretty, but this trip kind of sucked."
"index","pushing it at Index","Went to Index yesterday evening with Ruth.\
\
I haven't really pushed myself for leading rock in a while, and I was in the mood last night.\
I led Thin Fingers with one move of aid to get past the bouldery start off the ledge.  I was confident enough to climb through the liebacks and place pro sparingly at good stances.  But dammit, I still can't fucking do the first two moves off the ledge.  I can get two feet above the ledge but am too insecure to move higher.  If I can step onto the hold four feet above the ledge, I'm fine.\
\
Then I tried to squeeze in Sloe Children before it got dark.  At the very end of the traverse when you lean into the crack, I slipped.   I grabbed the rap chains as I was falling, which kept me from cratering awkwardly on my belayer or the ledge.  Fuck'n A.  Have to do it next time.\
\
Oh yeah, on the City Park bolt ladder, I haven't figured out the move past the third bolt.  I can do all the rest.  It seems like there's better holds further to the right, but they are further from the bolt."
"Mount-baker","Baker- Easton Glacier","Went and hiked the Easton this weekend.  Camped at 6600' at a sweet bivy that N Bratton told me about.  The snow was slushy on the hike in, but when we got going at 3am, it was perfect.  We made summit by 7am (only one other party up there and they had come from the CD) and were back at our bivy at 9:30.  The CD looked scary- covered by little black dots of climbers making it look like an ant hill.  Back to the car by 12:30.  Good weather an fun hiking.\
\
Notes:  The large crevasse on the upper wall that look slike a smiley face was so open that we had to scramble around it on the dirt to the climber's right.  Boot path makes it obvious."
"Sperry-peak","A nice night on Sperry Peak","How an easy climb can bite you in the ass.\
\
Sperry's NE Ridge sounded like a good, long, aerobic day trip to me when I was flipping through the Beckey guide on Friday. So, Saturday found Margie, Jeff, Hannah and myself started out at the Sunrise Mine TH around 8:45am. We hiked pretty fast and made decent time to where we had to cut cross country. We stepped off the trial into some brush and effectively ended all semblance of efficiency. From this point on, everything would take two to three times longer that necessary. \
\
After scrambling up a short, clean gully, we came to a small, melting snowfield. This was a little sketchy without crampons, but do-able. It took us 45 minutes (with one successful self-arrest). We crossed two more snowfields and ascended easy 3rd class to the base of the ridge. The time was 12:00pm when we reached the bottom of the route\
\
A couple members of our party felt uncomfortable ascending the exposed class four rock without a rope. Thus began, at 3,800’, the first of seventeen pitches (and seventeen straight leads for yours truly). The system was simple. I led and Margie followed, clipping out of gear but leaving it in place for Hannah and Jeff to use on their ascent. With a few meager exceptions, we pitched out every single foot of the 2,200’ ridge line. On Saturday, however, we only climbed six dirty, brush clogged pitches (~1000’) before everyone was mentally, physically and emotionally drained. \
\
This was owing to a number of factors. First, I was worked because I wasn’t mentally prepared to lead that many rope-drag filled class four pitches – we should’ve ascended them un-roped. Second, everyone else in the group had nearly zero experience with long alpine rock routes. This meant that the climbing took far longer than necessary as inexperienced members casually geared up, slowly cleaned the route, and leisurely ascended each pitch. The sense of urgency and efficiency was completely absent. Furthermore, a couple of us completely lost mental focus on this first day, ultimately leading to a fall on easy terrain that ripped the stunned belayer from the anchor above and nearly killed both people. \
\
By 7:30 we found a flat spot and stopped – time for an unplanned bivy. Margie hadn’t even brought a jacket, opting for liner gloves as the only piece of clothing in addition to what was on her back. Thankfully, the weather was pleasant. Margie and I managed to sleep for a few hours without too much shivering. The other couple didn’t have such a restful time.\
\
In the morning, we built a small fire for warmth and talked about our lack of food and water – most of which had been consumed the day before. We had 1,200’ to ascend and Margie and I had two cliff bars, half a personal pizza and two cups of trail mix between us. The first few leads were quite similar to Saturday’s. Low angle, brush choked terrain characterized these slow initial stretches. We finally arrived at the crux of the route, 4.5 hours after leaving our bivy site.   \
\
Pitch six was intimidating from below, but totally classy once you were on it. It was the most sustained angle we’d come across (Beckey rates it 5.6, I think). With plenty of exposure and great features, it came as a relief from all the shwacking we’d done up until that point. From my belay stance, I looked around for the flat spot that I thought I’d seen on the topo map. It was 12:20pm and we were 600’ below the summit after 6 hours of rock climbing. I though we had an easy out just around the corner. This turned out to be completely wrong.\
\
What we got instead was about 500 feet of the most exposed arête/ridge I’ve ever sauntered across. It was absolutely wonderful climbing with 80’ of air on one side and 800’ on the other. No one enjoyed it very much. We’d all run out of water two hours previous and Jeff was now completely delirious from the sun exposure. Watching him cross that ridge was the most frightening portion of the trip.\
\
Thankfully we’d started moving more quickly. By 3:30 I topped out and saw that the summit was only a sketchy snow crossing and marbles-over-boulders scramble away. More importantly, Margie found some running water trickling from a melting snow patch. With only one roped pitch remaining between us and the summit, we all felt a little emotional. Margie and I reached the summit at 5:30pm. Jeff and Hannah met us on the ridge line and elected not to tag the top. We started our descent at 6:00 and, with a few interesting sections of down climbing waterfalls, made it back to the car by 9:45pm.\
\
I learned so much on this trip that I’m not sure I can remember it all. I learned a new level of emotional, mental, and physical exhaustion. I learned all about the role of experience in determining one’s safety and speed in the mountains. I learned not take other peoples’ word for the climbing abilities of individuals I haven’t climbed with. I learned that even when everything goes to shit, one of the best things to remember is that perseverance can pull you through almost any situation.   \

Pictures to follow."
,"Dark Rhythm","I climbed Dark Rhythm yesterday with my friend Matt.  Dark rhythm is located just left of the westbuttress on Blueberry Hill in Darrington.  I highly recommend this route.  The climbing is safe but adventurous with moderate runouts on moderate terrain and better protected climbing on harder terrain.  Still, there are mandatory hardish (for me) moves with bolts a little ways below you.  I really like this style of climbing because you are unlikely to get badly hurt in a fall, but it is more commiting than a pure sport climb.  \
\
The crux pitch is one of the best I've done.  The other pitches are also quite good and vary from pure friction to interesting feature climbing.  Unlike last year when I climbed Jacob's ladder on Blueberry hill, this time we continued from blueberry terrace to the summit.  The climbing above the terrace is technically easier, but not nearly as well protected as the lower wall.  To reach the summit from blueberry terrace, we traversed left on easy terrain for 1 pitch from the top of Dark Rhythm.  Next, we followed the ridge/buttress crest up 3/4 of a pitch of 5th class climbing with spotty protection (I think the bushes are in here, but the tape must have fallen off).  Finally we traversed left again with very little protection until gaining the 3rd class bowl beneath the summit.  From here we scambled low angle slabs and bushes to reach the summit.   I'll post a few pics later."
"Goode-mountain","TR - Mount Goode - Northeast Buttress, 7/1-3/2006","I climbed the Northeast Buttress of Goode on Sunday with Blake on [url=http&#58;//www&#46;cascadeclimbers&#46;com/threadz/showflat&#46;php/Number/585847:1c8boujd]CascadeClimbers[/url:1c8boujd], where this TR is also posted. The route and weather conditions were excellent. \
\
I left Highway 20 on Saturday morning at 9 am and cruised the approx. 10 miles to the North Fork Bridge Creek junction, where I met Blake (who came up from Stehekin) at 11:40 am. A nice walk up the North Fork Bridge Creek drainage brought us to the foot of Goode. A log jam exists just upstream on Grizzly Creek making that crossing simple. The North Fork of Bridge Creek was not so simple. The water was flowing rapidly and neither of us felt comfortable crossing in flip flops at any point so we continued up valley with hopes of a snow bridge spanning the stream. That snow bridge was non-existent and we ended up using the rope to cross the stream much further upstream than we needed to, but at least it felt safe. We later talked to another pair of climbers that crossed the stream in tennis shoes with no problem. \

\
After crossing North Fork Bridge Creek, everything went exactly as planned with no time consuming errors. We traversed back over to where we would ascend the slabs and then worked our way up through the rock bands and some annoying slide alder. We finally broke out into the alpland below the hanging Goode Glacier and made our way up to the bivy spots, which are basically located on the highest vegetated knoll below the glacier. I’m glad we got there early enough to enjoy the pleasant evening and get some rest. \

\
After a very mild night, we woke up at 4:45 am and departed camp at 5:15, heading up a snow ramp and then straight up glacial slabs to an easy access point of the Goode Glacier. The glacier went fast and we were on the buttress before we knew it. It was only 6 am but the sun was already bright and it was warm. \

\
We pitched out the first two sections to get onto the buttress crest and then simul-climbed for around 800 vertical feet. The next few pitches were steeper, but really fun rock climbing with exposure. We simul-climbed the last few hundred vertical feet to the summit, arriving at 12:45 pm, 7.5 hours after leaving camp. \

\
The route was entirely snow free, but there were a few patches of snow just to the right of the route conveniently interspersed to allow for hydration. I used rock shoes and Blake led the whole thing in boots. \

The summit was nice and warm with hardly a breeze. We ate, relaxed, and enjoyed the view for an hour. It was cool to gaze down at the 2,700 vertical foot rock buttress we had just ascended. \

\
We left the summit at 1:45 and then carefully down climbed to a rappel anchor just above an awkward traverse to Blacktooth notch. One short rappel and a couple moves brought us to the ledge and the notch. From here, we down climbed some more and then made two rappels into the Southwest Couloir. Once out of the couloir, we had a sweet glissade that took us all the way to the meadows. \

Check out the huge chockstone wedged between the towers in the photo below. The towers are located on the ridge trending west off the summit of Goode. Blake spotted it on the way down and it is quite the geological phenom. \

We worked our way over to the ridge line to the west (skiers right) and then descended, eventually picking up the climbers path, which deposited us on the Park Creek trail. \

\
At the first stream crossing we stopped to give our feet an ice bath and then hiked 4 miles to the Stehekin road and the Park Creek camp. With 14.5 miles for me to hike on Monday morning, we left camp semi-early at 8:15 am to avoid the heat of the day (Bridge Creek trail traverses many open avy paths). We walked the road for around 2 miles to the Bridge Creek trail. Blake continued down the road while I began the final 12.5 mile trek. This hike was not the grueling march I thought it would be, but it wasn’t easy either, and my legs were very tired by the last three miles. Some cloud build-ups provided shade near the end which helped as well. I made it to the highway at 1:10 pm and then put my legs in the icy waters of Bridge Creek. \

What a sweet route with an awesome partner!"
"Mount-rainier","Rainier - Kautz Glacier - July 1-2, 2006","After making last minute arrangements to climb with Aaron Zabriskie and Justin Evans, the three of us met at U-Village on Saturday mornig to go climb Rainier. The plan was to head towards the Wapowety cleaver and decide based on conditions and energy level between the Fuhrer Finger, Kautz Glacier and Wilson or Kautz headwall. Aaron has pictres that he may share after he and Justin get back from Baker.\
\
Well we arrived, made our preparations with the park service and headed of sometime in the late morning. At some point after crossing the Nisqually and ascending the \""bowling ball alley\"" Fan onto the Wilson Glaicer, we realized that we also did not have a functioning watch. Aaron had decided to bring his phone because the alarm on it was bettwer than a watch alarm (see Adams Glaicer TR for the concequences of this) and so I opted not to bring an extra watch. Of course, once on the mountain, the phone kind of wonked out and was nolonger telling the time so the rest of the trip was based on guesswork or harrassing other parties for vital beta (\""hey dude, do you know what time it is?\"")\
\
Anyway, it took about 6 hours to make it up to an excellent bivy spot on the rock ridge of the Wapowety, a little shy of 11k feet. At this point we had already seen a large party of skiers descend the Fuhrer Finger in the afternoon, who were promptly followed by some rockfall half an hour later. The skiing looked great, but the objective hazard seemed less appealing for an all snow route. The Wilson also seemed like a bad choice considering the VW sized debris chute the comprised much of the lower route which was scoured out be seracfall from the ice cliff above. The Wilson headwall also looked pretty menacing, with a pantheon of dangling snice pillars glistening from the upper rock bands in the 70 degree sun!\
\
We made our bivy with the expectation of heading to the Kautz glaicer the next morning. After ejoying some food and rehydrating, we turned in at \""7:30\"" with the alarm set for \""2:00\"". We awoke when the alram went off, readied our packs and set off on good firm snow that had refrozen overnight. Unfortunately, withing the first 500 feet, Aaron relized that lack of sleep had left him feeling really wiped out, so he decided to return to the bivy, and after taking essentials like the camera and some extra water, Justin and I headed off to the Kautz. We negotiated a rock step with a hand line that takes you on to the glaicier below camp hazard, and without exposing you to the ice cliff, and the headed up steep snow to the base of the single ice pitch. We got there right at the same time as the only other party we saw on the route, but fortunately the throat of the ice chute is wide enough and conditions god enough for us to climb twenty feet to the right at the same time. Justin led this, placed a few screws, I followed up, past his bomber picket anchor, up another rope length on steep snow to where the glaicier mellowed, and we regrouped to head off on the rest of the route.\
\
It had turned light while we were climbing the ice pitch, and on Sunday with the sun came a lenticular cloud that would shroud the upper slopes in an icy fog for the rest of the day. On the upper Kautz we stepped into this and were only able to forge ahead thanks to a ephemeral boot track and sometimes widely spaced wands. This path lead us over the upper wapowety cleaver and onto the nisqally just above 13k, and after stepping over many small cracks, it turned towards the what we could only assume was the summit crater. \
\
Then came the funpart. After an hour or more of sloging from the cleaver in a complete whiteout with 25ft visability, the boot track disentigrated into ice and the wands disappered. Obviously, we were very close but there was no way to tell how close since neither Justin nor I own a GPS. And with the boot track providing our only reliable means of getting back down, Justin was rightly unenthusiastic about loosing track of that. As this was my first time up Rainier, I was still pretty keen on find a safe way to top out, so we gathered out matterials and  I headed of on a due North baring with all the pickets to set as wands, and one tool left as our anchor to the boot track. I placed a picket each rope length just as Justin would pass the last one. After placing the tird and final one, I moved forward and after 25ft I could just make out some of the exposed rock of the summit crater. I changed up there, and started wayving my hads to let Justin know that we had made it. We gathered, took obligatory summit pictures that will look like the inside of a sock, and turned around because the wind was pretty vicious.\
\
Admitedly, we did not stick around to traips on over to the Columbia Crest proper, the crater was good enough that day. Where we were, there was not a soul in sight, and there had not been for the several hours since we left that other party after the ice step at 12k. It is amazing what a difference a little weather makes, and for me it makes it all that much sweeter to have had to figure out how to get it done rather than sitting up top with fifty strangers in the sun. I hope I have other chances to climb on this amazing mountain, and maybe someday I will have a good reason to put my name in the summit registry.\
\
The decent went well and relatively quickly, with the one interesting part coming when Justin and I opted to down climb the ice pitch because when we arrived around noon, there was little worth making a rap anchor from. I belayed him down while he placed screws, and then I \""down-led,\"" cleaning the screws as I went. We then met up with Aaron, rested at our bivy, and headed back down to the car."
"Mount-baker","Mt. Baker","I feel like its time for me to actually write something for the first time in quite a while, although I'd much rather talk to people in person, so come climbing with me sometime.  \
\
Justin and I met up in Seattle Monday evening and drove to the Heliotrope Ridge trailhead with the intention of climbing the North Ridge to celebrate our Independence.  \

\
A brief spat of rain hit us on the way up the slope on the northwest side of the North Ridge.  I called a stop, said we should head down, and descended about thirty feet before more discussion.  The little voice in my head that Brian recommends listening to was winning, but Justin convinced me to keep going up by reasoning that the alternate, lower, and more commonly later-season approach to the upper North Ridge must be pretty cush and would make a quick bail option if we needed it.  \

\
Passed a spot in the boottrack where a member in the party in front of us put a foot in a bottomless crevasse, but ohterwise very easygoing the whole day to this point.  Stopped here, about fifty feet from the ice cliff and Justin said he heard thunder.  I didn't hear it, but the land and clouds were dark and it had started raining again.  I told him to put out the full rope length and got the rest of the rack ready, because I thought we could finish it before the weather arrived.  \
\
[img:88imushf]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/zman2208/baker4%2039&#46;jpg[/img:88imushf]\
\
One last pic, shot of gu, drink of water, and I started up past Justin when the world we were in started to come unglued.  The camera didn't leave its case for the rest of this trip.  Big hail, big wind, and death in the form of electricity shot from the sky surrounded us in less than a minute.  It was time to take cover.  As quickly as possible I clipped a picket and a couple screws to Justin's harness and as I was ready to lead off on the ice and had everything together, proceeded to run downhill.  There's the crevasse in the boot track, slow down for a sec and make my way caref-, shit put my leg in anyway, just roll out and keep running, lightning somewhat more pressing than the holes in the ground.  For a half-second I wonder if I should go back and hop in, but the moment has passed.  I hear something behind me not drowned out by the caucophony of wind, hail, and thunder and turn around.  \""I just fell in a crevasse!\"" shouts Justin back upslope as he lefts himself to his feet from the snow, juggling loose rope and his tools.  I couldn't care less and keep running downhill, trying to just face forward and ignore the tortured blasts of thunder overhead which are less than a second separated from the preceeding flashes of lightning.  We are the only objects sticking out on the snowy ridge.\
\
I stop when I feel like the wind is about to blow me off of my feet and look back at Justin who wasn't as ready to tear-ass downhill as me and needs a second to adjust before he is killed by an unprotected fall.  I was feeling generous and gave him about six seconds before starting to run again, spurred on by fresh sounds of impending doom.  A chute with sloppy snow over hard ice becomes visible leading to the northwest in the direction of the Coleman and Justin shouts to head towards it.  I can't hear his words, but understand the gestures.  The chute appears to taper out to steep rock about a hundred meters down, so I look over towards the Roosevelt Glacier side of the ridge, but see ice cliffs and jumbled crevasses.  I want to keep hauling ass down the chute, possible rock bands seem better than the icemaze, but Justin stops me, saying we should distance ourselves from our metal and find a place to get low away from the exposed ridge.  Justin has spent years on a fire crew in the Sierras so I defer to his experience with lightning.  \
\
We ditch everything but our clothes and crouch near a large rock a hundred feet down the chute from our gear.  Water is coarsing down in streams along the pumice and I start to realize how cold and wet I am.  I tell Justin I think I can last about 30 minutes without moving, but after about five I feel the need for action and leave to scout the descent down the chute.  It looks like it will go, but getting a good look requires that I stand in a more open location, where a high-pitched buzz emanating from seemingly everywhere persuades me to return to where Justin is sitting.  \
\
Finally the hail and rain subsides, the wind dies, the thunder and lightning stops, and the sun even starts to come out.  Justin and I grab our stuff and make our way carefully down the chute, over rocks and onto the glacier where the Roosevelt and Coleman meet.  When we finally reach a flat spot on the glacier we start to breathe easier and I start to feel bad for being a lot of an asshole during the storm.  A lot of glacier travel is in front of us however and our alternate descent has forced us to take a different line back to Heliotrope Ridge.  This line, predictably, sucks and keeps me stressed as we thread huge crevasses with heavy, wet snow interspersed with islands of bare ice.  More decompression takes place when we reach dry ground and unrope, and talk to members of the group who were ahead of us on route and spent the time when the thundercell passed by on the edge of a crevasse just below the summit.  They didn't seem all that fazed by it.  \
\
Justin comments on how fast the thunderhead came in, and how pushing upward wasn't very conservative considering we couldn't see approaching weather past the Roman nose.  We talk about the possible reasons people we know climb, the reasons we climb; demons come up more than once.  We look up at the mountain; totally clear, dazzling white, blue skies, the Coleman Headwall looks like it would be a killer route right now."
"Mount-olympus","Mount Olympus - Blue Glacier","Griff, Doug and I climbed Mt. Olympus over the long weekend.  We left Seattle around 7 PM expecting to sit in traffic and long ferry lines, but were pleasantly surprised to have no trouble on I-5 or on the ferry.  We drove to the Hoh Ranger Station and camped.\
\
The next morning we set out around 7:30 AM and were making good time until we started up hill.  You really get fooled on this approach since the first 12 miles are flat, then the near exponential growth starts.  Our pace slowed to a crawl, but we eventually made it to Glacier Meadows.  We managed to find a site although the camp was pretty full.\

The next morning we were up at 2 AM with two other parties and moving by 3 AM.  We reached the moraine and descended to the glacier where we roped up.  We set out first, and Griff lead out across the Blue Glacier to reach the base of the Snow Dome.  At this point, the sun rose over the ridge and illuminating the glacier and icefall. \

\
We reached the top of the Snow Dome and decided to go around and do the late season route.  Other groups did the 4th of July route, but the snow conditions sounded questionable from their description.   Since we were the first party up, we enjoyed the sounds of silence as we crossed the glacier.  \

We reached the summit block and headed up the NE buttress climbing a ledge system (3rd class) until it reached a short crack (4th class).  I lead up the summit block and decided I wanted to climb without my pack once I reached the 4th class.  I handed it down and climbed further only to realize that I’d left the small rack on my pack.  Oops.  Fortunately, Griff was able to pass it to me easily.   The rock wasn't too bad.  Although their were stretches of highly portable handholds, there were also very solid horns to sling and a few good cracks that took stoppers.  The party behind the party behind us asked if they could clip and clean our gear, to which we agreed.  From there we scrambled to the summit, where we enjoyed the views and chatting with other climbers.\

\
We took our time getting back to Glacier Meadows.  There, we packed up and headed down and camped at Martin Creek.  Being tired from the day before and being up early, we enjoyed a pleasant nap before dinner.\
\
The trip out the next day was uneventful.  It was easier to enjoy parts of it since it was shorter and we were heading downhill.  All in all, it was fantastic weekend in the Olympics.  This was my first mountaineering trip there and I was quite surprised as to how different a feel they have then the Cascades.  I look forward to returning there soon."
"Exfoliation-dome","Exfoliation Dome, Blueberry Hill, W Buttress 7/8","Aaron Z. and I climbed the West Buttress route on Exfoliation Dome yesterday.

"Mount-adams","TR - Mount Adams - Adams Glacier, 7/10/2006","Short Story: \
We climbed Adams Glacier Monday morning from the lake at the base of the north ridge in six hours roundtrip (north ridge descent). The weather was great and cramponing conditions were excellent. The route is still in-shape with only a few thinner snow bridges along the route.  \

Long Story: \
\
After Wimbledon and World Cup action Sunday morning (great outcomes for both), I met up with my good friend Bjorn and we drove off to do the Adams Glacier route on Mount Adams. We had both never ascended Adams and the route seemed interesting enough for both of us to justify the drive from the Seattle area. A very smooth drive and we were off on the trail at 5 pm. We made fast work of the approach arriving at a nice glacial lake at the foot of the north ridge of Adams at 7:30 pm. \

Studying the weather forecast Sunday morning, I knew a marine layer was coming in that night, but I was expecting it to be well below us – 2k to 3k elevation. It turns out there were two separate layers, one at about 2k and another at around 7k feet. The 7k layer was hovering just below our camp spot when we woke up which caused some trepidation. Nonetheless, we decided to climb up to the base of the Adams Glacier route with hopes of being decidedly above the layer, departing camp at 4:40 am. \
\
Soon after leaving camp, we saw that the marine layer was thin and stable. We would be completely above it for the entire route. \

In fact, the 7k layer slowly retreated and burned away as the morning wore on. \

Adams Glacier is a fun route and it was nice to not have to wake up extra early. The setting at Adams meadows is worth the visit alone with fabulous wildflowers. \

\
After a short rest we began the ascent of Sahale Arm.  The weather was spectacular and we were treated to amazing views of the Cacades.  \

We took a break at the glacier camp, where we saw a goat, my first in the Cascades.   \

\
The ascent of Sahale was straightforward.  We climbed around the peak through a notch on the east side.  We did protect a couple of moves there, but the climbing was generally uncomplicated.  On the north ridge, we dropped our packs and headed up to the summit.  \
\

\
After enjoying the summit, a quick rap brought us back to the packs.  From there, we continued across the Boston-Sahale Col.  This traverse is on loose rock, which required great care.  \

\
The next morning we woke early under a high layer of clouds.  Brian led out of camp as we set off for the North Face.  At the base of the face, Griff took over leading and led through the shrund, which we crossed on a large snow bridge and protected with pickets as deadmen.  Above the shrund, we stayed to climber’s left of the gully in the center of the face.  At the last picket, I took over the lead and led up a short rock step around some rotten ice.  Above that, there was a short stretch of ice.  This section will probably require rock climbing in a week.  Once above that, I built an anchor, and belayed Griff and Brian up.  Griff took over leading again, protecting the face with deadmen.  I took over for the final lead to the summit.  We refueled at the summit and enjoyed being in the middle of the Cascades.  The views were spectacular.  \

We headed down the loose rock to the snow where we traversed, plunge-stepped, and glissaded down to Upper Horseshoe Basin.  We debated returning via Sahale Arm but decided that we didn’t want to climb a gully that Beckey describes as “dangerous 3rd and 4th class,” so we opted to descend into Horseshoe Basin.  We began our descent constantly looking for a climber’s path or game trail.  Repeatedly, we were fooled by short patches of dirt.  The descent became slightly brushy and then very brushy.  Again and again our route cliffed out and we backtracked and continued to traverse to skier’s right.  After five hours of intense bushwhacking through dense brush and slide alder on steep slopes, we were mostly out of water.  Another traverse brought us to one of the many waterfalls, where we were able to pump water and refuel.  We saw a place to cross and an open flat area below, which would make a good campsite if needed.  When we reached the flat spot, Griff and Brian spotted a rap anchor.  We backed it up and then rapped the steep gully.  A little down-climbing brought us to the bottom of Horseshoe Basin about seven and a half hours after leaving the summit.  \

\
We refueled and set out looking for the trail.  The trail was somewhat obscure and required mild bushwhacking, river walking, and talus running (the mosquitoes had food for the first time in a long time).  Once we reached the main trail, we made good time to Cascades Pass and reached the car around midnight.  \
\
The North Face of Buckner was a great climb and I really enjoyed doing the route as a carry-over.  Camping on the Boston Glacier and having it to ourselves was amazing and I really liked the remoteness that dropping over Sahale brings.  The bushwhack into lower Horseshoe Basin was extremely unpleasant, but got us home.  The pictures were taken by Griff."
,"Visability on Saturday","Nice job guys. How about the visibility on Saturday? It was really something, Mike and I think we had aview of the front slope of the South Coast Range from the top of Forbiden, not to mention every major peak in the Cascades. Glad Buckner went well even though some clouds showed up. The Boston glaicier does look really specatular and remote and was in great view from the east ridge decsent we opted for."
"Prusik-peak","West Ridge of Prusik, 7-8-06","Dallas met me in Leavenworth Friday night on his way back to Entiat where he’s working for part of the summer. We headed to the Ranger Station at 7:30 Saturday morning, and there was no problem getting an overnight permit through the lottery system.  Only one party didn’t get a permit, and they said this was the first time they had to do a lottery at all because there were always enough permits to go around. Hiking into the Enchantment Lakes was long but beautiful, and extremely hot. We camped out on the slabby granite ridge just southwest of Prusik Peak.  There are a lot of great bivy spots up there and you’re really close to the climb too. Even with it being slightly windy we spent that night either swatting the swarming mosquitoes or with our heads in our bags sweating.  It was fun having the goat company though.  I’d be drifting off, and I’d hear “bahhh” and lo and behold a momma goat would be right there next to me on the boulder.  \
         After watching one of the most beautiful sunrises, we headed up to the base of the west ridge around 7:30, and Dallas took the first lead.  The first to pitches are very low class 5, then Dallas took the “crux” pitch which he didn’t think was bad at all, and there’s a fixed piton.  Most reports describe it as an unprotected traverse, but we both agreed it looked easier just to go straight up the slab, and skip the traverse.  I led the fourth pitch, and the last pitch was the most fun with a lie back flake and a “hilarious” squeeze chimney to top it off (the quotes are courtesy of Ralph’s TR  <!-- s:wink: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\"" alt=\"":wink:\"" title=\""Wink\"" /><!-- s:wink: --> ).  We just had one 60 m rope, so we rapped from the station just to the right of the chimney, and there were 4 single rope rappels to get us down to where we could scramble back to Prusik pass.\
       This was a fun route, although short and pretty mellow for such a long approach.  But camping up in the Enchantments is worth it for the awesome scenery and goats.  Plus I’ve wanted to climb Prusik for a while now.   I had the easier leads, so I didn’t feel really challenged, but that’s okay for a first alpine lead.  Swapping leads was definitely an efficient way to go.\
      The hike out left me making a promise to myselft that I would never hike in 96 degree weather again.  Especially when we didn’t want to filter water every hour, and I got stumbly from dehydration and heat exhaustion.  \
       Possibly some pictures to come if Dallas can get to a computer some time soon.  He’s living the simple life these days . . ."
"Mount-baker","Coleman Headwall","[img:2jdlapmi]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/ColemanHeadwall/zroute&#46;jpg[/img:2jdlapmi]\
\
Justin Evans and I decided we wanted something a little less burly than a 2-day Logan trip, so we settled on the Coleman Headwall, despite knowing that it would make Aaron jealous (Aaron and I bailed off the Headwall last year, and Justin and Aaron were chased off the North Ridge on July 4th by lightning).\
\
The views were gorgeous on the hike in, and we tried to scope out the route.\
\
[img:2jdlapmi]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/ColemanHeadwall/zbefore&#46;jpg[/img:2jdlapmi]\
\
After three hours from the trailhead, we passed by the Black Buttes camp, mobbed by at least thirty people.\
\
[img:2jdlapmi]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/ColemanHeadwall/zcrowds&#46;jpg[/img:2jdlapmi]\
\
We marched half an hour further (not nearly as far as I thought we went) to a flat spot where we set up camp, ate dinner (fortified with some hot Thai peppers), and watched the snow turn golden.  A huge system was to the north of us, as the forecast had predicted, and the temperatures were dropping.  We boldly set the alarm for 3:45 AM and went to bed.\
\
[img:2jdlapmi]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/ColemanHeadwall/zgolden&#46;jpg[/img:2jdlapmi]\
\
At around 2:30 AM we were awakened by the first sounds of the conga line heading up the C-D.  Around 3:30 the train was still continuing, and we decided to wake up.  We geared up and buried our bivy gear so it wouldn't blow away.  We opted for the high traverse (drop just below the base of the nose), which probably had a little more vert, but had minimal routefinding issues.  I underestimated how much time it would take (I really should know better by now), and we were at the base of the route proper around 5:30 AM.  \
\
The first portion was moderate-angled snow that was softer than we would have liked, but we kept going, expecting to find icier parts above.  The sun had risen and was lighting up the surrounding valleys, but given the headwall's NW aspect, it would be a long time before it got sun.\
\
[img:2jdlapmi]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/ColemanHeadwall/zlower&#46;jpg[/img:2jdlapmi]\
\
We then ran into an obstacle.  Ahead and to the left, massive leaning seracs.\
\
[img:2jdlapmi]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/ColemanHeadwall/zseracs&#46;jpg[/img:2jdlapmi]\
\
To the right, a dirty-looking stairstep that was a mix of ice and neve and some crap, but afforded decent pro and good rests.\
\
[img:2jdlapmi]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/ColemanHeadwall/zstairs&#46;jpg[/img:2jdlapmi]\
\
I led up about a full ropelength of the stairsteps and continued up the gentler snowfield above, which was fluted with runnels scoured from previous rock/icefall.  This part sucked for several reasons:\
\
1) I had made a 90-degree turn just after the ice step and had some ropedrag.\
2) I was kicking steps into what would have been nice neve had it frozen.\
3) I was hungry and thirsty but wanted to speed through the objective hazards.\
4) I was starting to get the urges to take a crap.\
\
We traversed up and left aways, traversed across a snowbridge (not visible on the route photo), and continued up a little more, where we saw a nice ramp to take us out of the hazard and onto the center of the headwall.  I passed the lead to Justin, as I was mostly out of gear (placed 3/3 pickets and 5/8 screws), and he led the ramp (gained by crossing another snowbridge) to a snow arete.  \
\
[img:2jdlapmi]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/ColemanHeadwall/zramp&#46;jpg[/img:2jdlapmi]\
\
Here we refueled and rehydrated, not having eaten/drank anything in three hours.  I decided I could keep the brownies baking until the summit, as it didn't look that far away (note the foreshortening visible between the two route shots), and we believed we were past the crux.  \
\
Justin took over leading (breaking trail) from here on.  First we had to cross the crevasse stretching across the face.  We found a spot that looked like an easy 6-foot step, though the problem was it wasn't ice or even neve, it was soft snow.  After much groveling, including a false start, Justin made it past the step.  He belayed me up this portion, though it was much easier for me, as he had already dug out the placements.  \
\
[img:2jdlapmi]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/ColemanHeadwall/zstep&#46;jpg[/img:2jdlapmi]\
\
We then simuled quite a ways up more kick-step snow until we scooted to the right past the final crevasse.  We thought we were home-free, and we were glad to be on the summit soon.  Clouds were starting to come in, and our time spent on the lower face without food/water was catching up to us.  We got quite a sting in the tail when we discovered that the face above the crevasse was hard ice, almost like the melt-freeze associated with water ice.\
\
[img:2jdlapmi]http&#58;//www&#46;cs&#46;washington&#46;edu/homes/gyngve/ColemanHeadwall/zicy&#46;jpg[/img:2jdlapmi]\
\
This portion, though it took screws well, was tedious and tiring.  Finally we passed near the rocks, where the ice had softened somewhat on the surface and gradually gave way to easier snow and a gentler slope.  However we still were not on the top!  Each time we (Justin, me, and my intestines) thought we were getting closer, the slope would just ease off a little more and still keep going up.  Our pace slowed.  The snow changed to ball-bearing ice crystals, and the clouds dropped closer and closer to us.  WTF?  The weather forecast was supposed to be much better than this!  The system was supposed to be further to the north, and the real mess wasn't due until Monday.\
\
Finally we were on the summit.  Visibility had gone down to about 200 feet, and Justin was freezing his ass off waiting for me because I was literally freezing my ass off.  But boy did I feel better.  We then got the hell off, as the visibility dropped even more, and it started to rain ice pellets.  The descent was easy to find, thanks to all the traffic on the route.  But we took our time going down, thanks to fatigue (we were too hurried by the storm to eat or drink anything on the summit) and crappy snow conditions (in some places slush over ice).  When we got halfway down the hogsback, the storm eased up, and we downed some much-needed food and water.\
\
We made it back to camp pretty quickly after that and packed up, glad that we hadn't summited any later.\
\

\
We hiked out, chatting with a friendly Mountain Madness guide and his client, and bumping into a few dayhikers.  But the Buttes camp was all but deserted, the weekend being over.  The hike out went really fast, thanks to the cooler of beer waiting in the car.\
\
Thanks for the good trip, Justin!"
"Mount-rainier","Hiking up Mt. Rainier (the DC route) 7/8-7/10","Saturday afternoon through Monday we* spent a leisurely two and a half days hiking around Rainier and eventually headed up Disappointment Cleaver.  \
\
Monday morning we woke up to our tents rattling in the gusty winds, but balmy temps outside.  We roped up and left our camp at Ingraham Flats a little after 1:00 am.  The route is in great shape and a nice hike to the summit.  An RMI group that went up Sunday evening had even put in a ladder over one of the “cracks” around 13,000 feet, making the one possibly sporty part of the route just a step across a bridge.  We reached Columbia Crest around 6:15, just in time to watch the sun rise out of the clouds.  Gusts at the summit were estimated to be 60 mph (per Mr. Hahn) so we soon dropped back down to the register where we waited 20 or 30 minutes for our two other rope teams to come across the crater.  After a brief summit celebration my rope amigos and I headed down and began passing the RMI teams on the lower portions of the upper mountain.  We had timed our trip down just right, as we were able to avoid having to pass ascending rope teams as we descended the DC.  Made it back to Ingraham Flats around 9:00 and after much waiting in camp and at Muir for our other rope teams, we all trickled into the Paradise parking lot in time for happy hour.  \
\
Had my best ever $3.50 can of Rainier beer (Thank you Mr. Uzwack!).  Good times had by all and a great first summit of Rainier.\
\
Eventually I’ll get around to posting some pictures, really, I promise.\

,"full spray ahead","not having been up there, I in no way can comment on the accuracy of their wind speed assesment, but I can tell you from working at Mammoth that although burly, 60 mph gust are quite managable. We routinely kept some lifts running in these conditions and I other patrollers were always out working in winds like that or greater. So it can be done (these speeds we gathered from our weather stations on the hill)."
"Mount-adams","Mt. Adams - SW Chutes and Avy Glacier","On my drive down to Northern California, I decided to climb the south side of Mt. Adams. I wanted to see what kind of shape I was in (Shasta would be a 7,300’ push). \
\
I arrived at the parking lot at 10:15 Thursday night and set up the back seats of Edna (my Malibu Maxx) for a comfy trailhead bivy. The first party left around 4:30am, I waited for an hour and a half before setting out. \
\
There was no way in hell I’d be caught on the tourist route on a Friday. So, I struck out to have a look at the White Salmon Glacier. In the end, the crevasses were well-developed enough to force me up the SW Chutes. I took the western most chute and traversed over to the upper Avalanche Glacier. This was an interesting and relatively aesthetic line. It allowed for a few nice headwalls both on the traverse from the chutes and at the end of the Glacier. \
\
I took a break at the saddle between the summit proper and the false summit. By 10:49 I arrived on the highest point of Mt. Adams. I had the top all to myself! For a full hour! On a Friday! It was peaceful and I took a nice nap. \
\
Descending the standard route, I encountered the very hordes I’d so successfully avoided on the ascent. About 1,000’ below the false summit, I came across a rescue in progress. It appeared as though a young guy had broken his leg. A helicopter had already been dispatched, so I wished them luck and continued my lackadaisical descent. I went past two parties of 15 on their way up before reaching the car. What a day on Washington’s “less popular” volcano. It was time to tackle California’s most popular."
,"Exit 32 cragging","Last weekend I went to WWI with Cam.  We warmed up on Girls in the Gym, then I tried to onsight Psychowussy (which didn't go so well, but I got it on my 3rd go).  He then did Jealsous God (.12a) which I followed and is super fun, long moves through a roof on good holds then a heinous sloper around the lip makes up the crux.  Cam then worked his way (for the first time up Chronic (.13b) while I stared up in amazement.  We finished the day off with a pitpiful performance by me on Aborigine.\
Then yesterday, Josh Whorley and I went back to WWI.  We warmed up on the .10c and .10d at the far left end of the wall (BLM-5 and BLM-6 I think).  Both are fun, but more slabby/techniquey than the rest of WWI.  We then moved on to The Bad Guy (.11c).  I tried for the onsight of this one as well, but got smacked  down and hung some 4 or 5 times- lame.  Josh then flashed it, I ate a cliff bar and drank some water, then it went clean on my 2nd go.  We then moved over to \""Sweet Tooth\"" (.12a) about which in the guidebook says \""It's good to be tall\"".  I don't think I've read anything truer.  I watched as Josh made his way to the first crux (a blank looking bulge) and spent quite a bit of time finding some holds to use, he finally did, but I was nervous because he was stretched tip to tip (for those of you who don'tknow hime, I think he's around 6'2\""-ish while I'm 5'6\"").  He then spent some time on the second crux (which looked even harder) and then it was my turn.  I don't think I've ever wallowed so much on a climb.  After falling several times, I pulled on a draw to by-pass the first bit, then hung all over the second crux and again, pulled on a bolt.  Both feeling entirely dejected, we cooled down on \""Disincarnate\"" (.11a) which is pretty over-hung, but with huges holds.  I made it through the pumpy bit, but failed at the bouldery mantle finish, Josh followed it clean.\
We then hit Scott's Dairy freeze for obligatory caloric refill."
,"Rockfall... can happen to you at the crag","Watch out for rockfall, sometimes it can happen in even the most innocent of places.  Here is my backpack after potentially lethal (thankfully noone was hurt) rockfall onto the base of Thin Fingers on the Lower Wall at Index.  This is pretty rare, but you might log this away in the back of your brain somewhere.

"three-o-clock-rock","3 O'Clock Rock, 7/16","J. Stern, Boyd, and I lurched into Darrington Sunday in Boyd's veggie-diesel Mercedes looking for some granite.  There was a regular crowd of vehicles at the trailhead and a surprising number of climbers on the rock.  Josh started up a cleaned-up crack system that we thought was Cornucopia, but really was Big Tree.  There was some clusterfuckage as I looked for the second belay.  It's not worth explaining in excruciating detail, but I ended up belaying Josh and Boyd up to one hanging stance while I was at another, whose anchor was a single bolt plus the bolt 15 feet above me that I had lowered off of.\
\
Eventually, we climbed a lovely lieback corner to another slabtastic semi-hanging belay.  Boyd grabbed some slings and launched himself upwards, not slowing down to look for the next bolt until he was about 30 feet up from the first one.  Josh and I heard some amusing comments and the sound of lichen being crushed underfoot.  I added another biner to Josh's tie-in, just in case.  Thankfully, Boyd didn't come bowling down the slab.  He sketched his way down, over, and up to the second bolt.  Phew.\
\
After that, we did some awesome slabby rappelling and finally drank some water.  By now, it must have been after 3pm, since we were in the shade (that's where 3 O'Clock Rock gets its name).  The crowd had thinned out.  We climbed the three routes below the Great Arch&mdash;all recommended, though they're on rusty old bolts.  For the one on the left, bring a couple cams 1/2-2\"" unless you like it runout.\
\
The veggie oil fuel line underneath the greasemobile was still intact after scraping up rocks on the forest road, so we made it home.  Good times.  I can't feel my left big toe today from all the standing around at belays."
"Mount-shuksan","TR - Mount Shuksan - North Face, 7/15-16/2006","Short Story: \
\
Jesse and I climbed the North Face of Shuksan Sunday morning. Aside from an open bergshrund on the lower North Face glacier (a second tool was essential for me) the route was straightforward with excellent cramponing conditions all the way up and awesome weather. This TR is also [url=http&#58;//www&#46;cascadeclimbers&#46;com/threadz/showflat&#46;php/Number/588747:2jmsljur]here on Cascade Climbers.[/url:2jmsljur] \

\
We hiked the approach in 3 hours, 45 minutes following beta from previous posters. Descending to the bottom of the White Salmon valley from the top of the clear cut and then ascending the other side worked out well – thanks! We were thankful that it was not too hot for the steep walk up the woods on the other side. \

\
Clouds formed remarkably fast as sunset neared and we were in a white-out for a couple hours just before and after sunset. All clouds dissipated rapidly thereafter and it was completely clear by midnight. First, there was an amazing display of stars and then a really bright moon came out.  \
\

We departed camp just after 5:10 am Sunday morning and quickly worked our way up the lower glacier. \

We encountered a high and wide bergshrund which spanned the entire glacier and found and snow bridge across it with a steep snow step to get over it. \

From here, a long traverse around the pyramid, while negotiating some crevasses on the Crystal Glacier, brought us to the summit gully. \

After a rest, we scrambled up the gully and summited at 9:45 am, rested some more, enjoyed the views, and then descended.\

\
The slog down the Sulphide, through Hells Highway, and over the Upper Curtis was fun albeit long. We took it easy through here to conserve energy for the rest of the descent and to keep Jesse’s ankle from rolling due to poor crampon fit. \
\

\
Winnies slide featured hard snow, but no ice yet. The next snow section on the White Salmon seemed steeper and still hard so it took us a little time to downclimb this part. We then followed a route we had scoped out from our bivy spot the night before, which was circuitous, but avoided some potential troubles if we headed straight down, including large moats, cliff bands, and rockfall from the Hanging Glacier. \

\
From the bottom of the snow, we had a helluva time in White Salmon river valley to get back to the forested rib and up to the road. We dealt with some thick sections of slide alder and very annoying salmon berry patches. It basically sucked, but it always seems worse when you are in it, and we weren’t in it for that long. After reaching the forest, it was up and out, reaching the car at 5:40 pm, 12.5 hours from camp to car.  \

\
The North Face of Shuksan was a sweet route. We climbed six glaciers (Hanging, Crystal, Sulphide, Upper Curtis, White Salmon, and the North Face Glaciers) and basically walked around the mountain. I really got a feel for how big Shuksan really is. We definitely made a few route finding errors which cost us some time and Jesse can attest that his crampons, which didn’t seem to fit properly at any point during the climb, did not help make fast time on the snow descent. Nonetheless, with perfect weather, clear views, and a great partner it was all part of the fun!\
\
Thanks for the great day Jesse!\

Brought two screws and a picket but didn't use (could have on shrund). Used second tool.  \
\
[b:2jmsljur]Approach Notes:[/b:2jmsljur] \
No trail, descend forest to White Salmon river, cross it, and ascended forest on the other side until you reach alpine meadows. I think descending out of White Salmon River Valley sucks any way you slice it, but it's only a matter of time before you make it to the road!"
"Mount-maude","Mt. Maude - North Face","Justin Evans and I climbed the North Face of Mt. Maude this Sunday.\
\
Aaron, Justin, Margie and I made the approach together, as Aaron was planning to climb the scramble route on Fernow and Margie wanted to scale the N Face. She decided, however, that it wouldn’t be the safest idea after her time “on the couch” and all the talk of doing the traverse un-roped. \
\
So, at 4am on Sunday morning Aaron, Justin and I set out under a full moon. Aaron soon detoured to the West, while Justin and I arrived at the col by 5:30. \

\
\
The traverse was classy class 3/4 Entiat crumble interspersed with a few avoidable patches of hardened snow. \

\
\
After roping and racking up, we headed out onto the face itself. A brief headwall was enjoyably steep, but not worthy of a second tool. \

\
\
In fact, of the three simul-leads that Justin and I traded, only one (the last one) required a second tool. The middle section was spicy on account of a three foot deep gully that guided a constant stream of gravel down the face. \
[img:hbzgvrpi]http&#58;//lh4&#46;google&#46;com/image/coxworth/RknGmb_5JdI/AAAAAAAAAbo/fDErO1tvxew/Rock%20Band&#46;jpg?imgmax=512[/img:hbzgvrpi]\
\
\
Sometimes the rocks popped out, which made for an interesting time at the belay station. I ducked a lot. The final pitch made the whole affair worthwhile - about 200’ of 50-60 degree neve before topping out 50’ below the summit.\

We lounged on top for an hour before beginning the descent. \

\
\
The scree made our decision to carry 8 slings, a few hexes and nuts, four screws, and a cam seem quite dumb. Our three pickets would’ve been totally sufficient for the route we found. In the end, ‘twas a good route (thanks to that final pitch) and a great trip with wonderful company. Always nice to spend a weekend in Leroy Creek Basin! \

"Mount-logan","Mount Logan - Douglas Glacier: 7/21-22/2006","Short story: \
\
I climbed the Douglas Glacier on Mount Logan via Easy Pass. We made the approach to the 4,800 foot basin on Friday and I summited on Saturday morning in 6 hours round trip from camp. We then hiked out Saturday afternoon. The route is still in-shape as the glacier is mostly straightforward. Many thanks to the trip report from a month ago and the ranger report from last week. \
\
Photos and more: \
\
We set out from the Easy Pass trailhead at 12:30 pm on Friday. The walk up to Easy Pass was hot, but once there, we were treated to an amazing display of wildflowers. Mount Logan and the route up Douglas Glacier were clearly visible too. \
\

\
We descended into Fisher Basin enjoying wildflowers all the way to the valley floor. Continuing through forest, we finally reached the valley through which the melt waters of Douglas Glacier flow. Easy cross country travel through old growth forest brought us to the devastating slide path. We ascended from the lower to upper basin, taking a brushier route than we could have (as we discovered on the descent). This would have been of little consequence, but my partner was already feeling the effects of heat exhaustion and the extra chunk of brush only compounded the problem. We arrived at the upper basin (4,800 ft) at just after 7 pm and then I went about finding a suitable camp spot. Everything was either rocky or boggy except one sand bar I found along the rushing glacier waters. With minimal effort, we had a perfect spot for the tent (which I was thankful to have because of the bugs). \
\
[img:10prj3lz]http&#58;//www&#46;cascadeclimbers&#46;com/plab/data/509/3820Logan0028&#46;JPG[/img:10prj3lz]\
\
The following morning, my partner was still feeling the effects of heat exhaustion, so I set out to do the Douglas Glacier solo, departing at 5:10 am (no action shots…sorry). A ranger report from the previous week gave me confidence the route could still be soloed. I ascended the slabs and worked my way up to the glacier. \
\
[img:10prj3lz]http&#58;//www&#46;cascadeclimbers&#46;com/plab/data/509/3820Logan0014&#46;JPG[/img:10prj3lz]\
\
The glacier was still relatively straightforward. My route had no ice, very little crevasse end-running, and only a few snow bridges to cross. The glacier as a whole was much more crevassed and broken than photos from a month ago, but the route will probably stay in-shape for a couple more weeks. \

\
I quickly worked my way up the glacier and the hidden steeper snow slope to the col between the Douglas and Banded Glaciers (the Banded appeared very broken from above). From here, it was a simple scramble to the summit arriving at 8:05 am, just under 3 hours from camp at 4800 ft. \

At the summit, I enjoyed the warmth and calm conditions for 50 minutes. Not only did the high clouds make for pleasant climbing weather, they also created some of the best photography light and clarity I have encountered in the mountains. \

While I have seen the view from Logan before via the Fremont, it was very dramatic to see the sweeping Boston Glacier appear for the first time only minutes before the summit. \

\
I retraced my steps down the glacier and then spent some time finding the right slab to descend to the upper basin. Down climbing the slab was probably the hardest part of the climb, but I made it to camp at exactly 11:10 am, six hours after setting out. \

\
My partner got some good rest and was feeling much better, so we packed up and set out for the trailhead at just before 12 noon. The view from the slabs allowed me to pick a route that minimized the brush and we were in the old growth forest and out to the Fisher Creek trail before we knew it. A quick walk up the valley, head down up to Easy Pass, and then tired legs and sore feet down to Hwy 20, arriving at the trailhead at 5:15 pm and at my home in sweltering Sammamish at 8:30 pm for dinner!  \

The Douglas Glacier route was very enjoyable. The avy swath gives the option of doing this route in two days by motivated parties (I still had a few hours daylight), but as the glacier becomes more complex to navigate and the snow melts under the slide debris, it will be more difficult. Either way, expect to return tired if you do it in two days! \

Notes: A tent was nice to have to keep the bugs out!  The trail is brushy in sections down in Fisher Creek. The avy swath from the lower to the upper 4,800 foot basin is still fast trip with hard snow underneath the debris."
"Ptarmigan-traverse","Ptarmigan Traverse - 7/17-7/22/06","Jim Prager and I completed the Ptarmigan Traverse in 6 days over the last week.  The route is currently in spectacular shape with few difficulties.  We expected route finding to be challenging, but route finding proved to be much easier than the area peaks.\

Day 1: Cascade Pass to Kool-Aid Lake\
\
After dropping my car off at the current end of Suiattle River Road, we headed up Cascade River Road and were hiking by a little after noon.  Having been up to Cascade Pass just the previous week, there was little to do but put our heads down and hike.  The views from the pass were spectacular (as always) and the climber's trail over mixup arm brought us quickly to the Cache Glacier.\
\

\
Though the glacier was in fine shape (as were all the glaciers on the route), we chose to rope up.  We felt the added time well spent since we'd be heading into an area with few exit options.\
\
From Cache Col it was a stroll down to Kool-Aid Lake where we set up camp and contemplated local peaks, glaciers, and the occaisional marmot.\
\

\
Day 2: Kool-Aid Lake to Yang Yang Lakes (Formidable attempt)\
\
The day dawned overcast, with limited visibility.  Though the weather forecast for the week was sunny, we didn't have clear skies until Thursday.  Which was fine, since the high clouds kept the worst of the heat off us for the longest days of the traverse.\
\
The highlight of my morning was a family of goats that walked through our camp.  I've been waiting three years to see a mountain goat and just saw my first last week on Sahale Arm.  Very cool animals.\
\
[img:1hg09icj]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/73/196435819_c6718596d8_m&#46;jpg[/img:1hg09icj]\
\
From Kool-Aid Lake it was an easy traverse to the Red Ledges, where a fifteen foot segment of 3rd class rock confronted us.  Given the weight of our packs and the exposure, we chose to haul packs (though in retrospect a belayed ascent would have made more sense).\
\
[img:1hg09icj]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/70/196435857_58a2381ac2_m&#46;jpg[/img:1hg09icj]\
\
Just beyond the Red Ledges, a party of three passed us coming in from Cascade Pass with the intention of completing the traverse in a single day (they bivied that night at White Rocks - very impressive).\
\
Beyond the gnarly Red Ledges, we made good time to the Middle Cascade Glacier, an awesome torrent of ice spilling down the flank of Formidable Peak.\
\
[img:1hg09icj]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/63/196435930_a417da3fcd_m&#46;jpg[/img:1hg09icj] [img:1hg09icj]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/66/196435964_37cac3235b_m&#46;jpg[/img:1hg09icj]\
\
A somewhat sunny ascent brought us to the Spider-Formidable Col and our first views of the Le Conte Glacier.\
\
[img:1hg09icj]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/73/196435990_3c5af713c1_m&#46;jpg[/img:1hg09icj] [img:1hg09icj]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/68/196436035_d254a3f79f_m&#46;jpg[/img:1hg09icj]\
\
We plunged stepped down from the col (and each experienced an unexpected fall on random bits of icy snow) before the slope mellowed out and we contoured around on the boot track and then dumped packs for an attempt to scramble Formidable Peak.  We found the route straightforward until we reached the hard snow of the upper snowfield.  Since we'd (stupidly) left our clamps back at our packs, neither of us felt very confident on the icy, exposed slopes and we chose to turn back.  Even a few hundred feet below the summit, the views were really something else.\
\

\
A bit frustrated, we headed back down and resumed our descent to the lovely (as Beckey describes them) Yang Yang Lakes.  Would have liked to go for a swim, but by the time we'd arrived the sun was already behind the ridge and a wind had picked up.\
\
Day 3: Yang Yang to White Rocks Lakes\
\
Our longest day on the traverse.  Up before 5 am and out of camp before 6, we quickly gained the ridge above the lakes on a boot track nearly invisible from below.  The track passes through an obvious weakness in the cliff band on heather and sound rock.  Up on the ridge, heading towards Le Conte Peak, we were treated to an unexpected marine layer.\
\
[img:1hg09icj]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/59/196436159_7933be8423_m&#46;jpg[/img:1hg09icj] [img:1hg09icj]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/74/196436180_61988ad514_m&#46;jpg[/img:1hg09icj]\
\
We dropped packs at the base of Le Conte Peak and headed up the prominent snow field on the side of the peak and exited onto relatively sound talus.  The route goes as class 2 for most of the way, though there is some exciting class 3 above the notch to the left of the true summit.  The rock is very sound and the scramble was quite fun.  Nothing on the summit - no register, no cairn, but the views were OK.   <!-- s;) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\"" alt=\"";)\"" title=\""Wink\"" /><!-- s;) -->\

\
From Le Conte, we resumed our descending traverse to the Le Conte Glacier.  We thought we saw a bear on the glacier in our line of travel, but it turned out to just be a rock.   :rolleyes:  Great views of the ice fall (nowhere near the route) and Sentinel and Old Guard Peaks.  The glacier travel involved one snow bridge crossing which will certainly be melting over the past few days.\
\
[img:1hg09icj]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/71/196436346_723aea8a6d_m&#46;jpg[/img:1hg09icj] [img:1hg09icj]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/62/196436370_60751027c8_m&#46;jpg[/img:1hg09icj] [img:1hg09icj]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/58/196436392_78a757d8f2_m&#46;jpg[/img:1hg09icj] [img:1hg09icj]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/63/196436409_a987829137_m&#46;jpg[/img:1hg09icj]\
\
Again dropping packs at Sentinel Pass, we took a crack at Old Guard Peak.  We ascended the snow finger visible in the picture to its top, which turned out to involve a relatively sporty bit of hard 45 degree snow at the top which took me a long time to come down.  At the Old Guard-Sentinel Col, we dropped crampons and ice axes and wedged ourselves into the moat to get on route.  I got about five feet from the snow before encountering a smooth, low angled ramp about eight feet long we sparse hands and feet.  Already tired and nervous about the snow finger some fifteen feet below I tried to make the move out on to the slab, but was worried I wouldn't be able to safely make it back down.  Jim said he'd been worried about even the opening sequence I'd done and we agreed that Old Guard wouldn't be climbed today.  This first ramp could be protected by a small nut or possibly a cam and the climbing looks quite solid above this point.\
\
Returning to our packs, we descended onto the snow slopes on the west flank of Sentinel Peak above the South Cascade Glacier.  Apparently, even the goats enjoy the view.\
\
[img:1hg09icj]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/74/196436416_58d841f5b5_m&#46;jpg[/img:1hg09icj] [img:1hg09icj]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/59/196436432_38f333617a_m&#46;jpg[/img:1hg09icj] [img:1hg09icj]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/64/196436445_c52ce802f1_m&#46;jpg[/img:1hg09icj]\
\
We were too late in the day to attempt Sentinel (and too tired to try Lizard by the time we reached Lizard Pass), but the SW ridge of Sentinel looks quite feasible.  Of course, Le Conte looked like easy 2nd class from the ground and turned out to be substantially more gnarly from up close.\
\
At Lizard Pass, we headed down to White Rocks Lakes on some of the most unpleasant scree of the trip.  The best descent option is to take the snowfield to skiers right from Lizard Pass to its pass, then traverse to skiers left onto a slightly more stable scree slope (cairned).  We came down on scree from the pass and it was very unpleasant (scree and sand over slabs).  The lakes are still at an early stage of thawing.\

\
Camping at the lakes is an amazing experience - the views are unrivaled by any of the other sites along the traverse.  Gunsight and Elephant Head had spectacular alpinglow in the setting sun.\

\
Day 4: White Rocks Lake to Dome-Dana Col\
\
Here we deviated from the normal traverse route to get set up for Dome Peak the following day.\
\
Our late start from camp was observed by a watchful goat.\
\
[img:1hg09icj]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/71/196436540_c2f19b9dac_m&#46;jpg[/img:1hg09icj]\
\
From White Rocks, the climber's track descends quite far down into the valley before effectively ending at a melt stream/avy gully coming from higher up the cirque.  We crossed and plunged into the scrub on the other side, then climbed quickly to the base of the Dana Glacier.  No boot track observed from above, and the only \""trail\"" I found was boot scaring near the start of snowfield.  I imagine yearly avalanches do much to obscure any trail.\
\
Here we rested and joked with a party of seven that had spent the previous day resting at White Rocks.  They were a great bunch and we would have enjoyed spending more time in their company.  However, we shortly parted ways - they heading for Spire Pass and us towards to the Dome-Dana col.\
\
The Dana glacier is in great shape (I feel like a broken record), with only one sporty bit of icefall to cross.  We conservatively protected it with a pair of ice screws (hey, we'd brought them along - might as well use them) before ascending to the more mild upper Dana.\
\

\
We reached the Dome-Dana Col around 3 PM, and sacked out in the shade of the ridge, glad to have some time to rest.  We also used some black trash bags to engineer a pair of solar stills for about 3L of water before the sun dropped behind the ridge.\
\

\
Day 5: Dome-Dana Col to Cub Lake\
\
From the col, we ascended easy glacier to the notch north of Dome's summit at 8560'.  My altimeter had lost about 200' overnight and my GPS had a lot of trouble fixing our elevation, which almost sent us up a much more difficult snow and ice slope to the south of Dome's summit (which would have been bad).  Easy climbing until the final 100' of exposed traverse.  Jim led out, protecting the traverse with a sling, cam, and nut before building and anchor and belayed me across to a block about 15' below the true summit.  The climbing is at most stiff 3rd class, but the exposure (especially with moderate winds) was very unnerving.  This was, unfortunately, to prove our high water mark on Dome.  Jim didn't feel comfortable leading the next bit and I can't set protection (need to work on that), so we called it and headed back.  The views from near the summit were exceptional.  As a consolation prize, we wandered over to the mellow south summit and decided to come back someday for the north face of Sinister.\
\

\
Back down the glacier (now baking in the sun) and over to Itswoot Ridge.  The talus fields below the glacier are melting out and make for the most hazardous travel on the traverse.  The views towards Glacier and back towards Dome are hard to beat though.\
\
[img:1hg09icj]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/73/196436886_1cf3deb5aa_m&#46;jpg[/img:1hg09icj] [img:1hg09icj]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/68/196436906_4c95983824_m&#46;jpg[/img:1hg09icj] [img:1hg09icj]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/44/196436940_472927af37_m&#46;jpg[/img:1hg09icj]\
\
The bugs started getting bad on Itswoot Ridge and increased in ferocity as we descended to Cub Lake.  We got in a quick swim and tried enjoying the grassy meadows by the lake shore, but around 5 PM were driven into the tent by mosquitos and biting flies.  Next time I head out, I'm bringing the DEET.  The chemicals can't be worse than being peppered by bites.  A couple came through our tent site that evening to go for a swim before a planned attempt of Dome the next day.  We wished them luck in their endeavors and they helpfully pointed out the faint climber's track on the north side of Cub Lake.\
\
Day 6: Cub Lake to Downey Creek\
\
Chased by the bugs out of camp in our best pack up time of the trip, we quickly gained the ridge above Cub Lake and began our descent of Bachelor Creek.\
\
[img:1hg09icj]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/67/196436963_18e9407ecd_m&#46;jpg[/img:1hg09icj]\
\
We'd spent the better part of two days steeling ourselves for the purportedly horrific descent and had worked it up to a miserable battle through avalanche debris and slide alder.  A year ago, I'd encounted five grizzled (though I suppose after 5-6 days in the backcountry everyone looks grizzled) climbers on their way down Downey Creek who, in answer to my question about the Bachelor Creek trail snorted, \""Trail?  There's no trail up there.\""\
\
Jim and I were pleasantly surprised by how not bad the Bachelor Creek descent turned out to be.  The first bit is easy meandering through meadows high on the creek before plunging into avalanche swept slopes.  There are some serious blowdowns, but they never obscure the trail for more than 100' and we were able to get down and into the old growth forest with minimal gymnastics.  Once in the forest, the trail is a very pleasant, easy to follow track.  And then we emerged from forest and into a wall of slide alder.  Bracing ourselves, we ducked into the brush and emerged in about 10' in a lot of brush, but no alder.  That was the worst of the descent.  Lots of brush obscuring the boot hardened climber's track.  If you were carrying skis, the alder might be more of a problem, but for us with full packs it was really nothing to write home about.  Descending Horseshoe Basin was *much* worse.  The crux is the river crossing around 4200' on a wide log.  The log is obvious and flagged by pink and white tape.  A little more brush on the other side and into pleasant forest which deposited us at Downey Creek before we knew it.\
\
The hike out Downey Creek to the car took more time than I expected, but we still reached it around 3 PM, with plently of time to get back to Seattle for dinner.  Milkshakes at the Burger Barn in Darrington heralded our return to civilization.\
\
In summary:\
\
This is an amazing trip and the current high point of my hiking and scrambling days.  The area peaks make for challenging scrambles and the scenery is unparalleled.  Great trip with a great partner.  Good times."
"liberty-bell-mountain","NW Face Liberty Bell, Tunnel Route Concord Tower","Don't take NCNP for granted.  We got shut out of Triumph because they only allot two permits for spending the night above Thornton Lakes.  Thought about going bandit, but there isn't a lot of room to hide with the bottleneck at the notch along the southeast side of the mountain.  We were not super smart and were inadequately prepared for alternative plans.  But Washington Pass provided fun times.  NW face on Saturday and Tunnel Route on Sunday.  The crowds, heat, and bugs all sort of combined to shorten the amount of climbing we ended up doing, but oh well.  \

"index","Aid hiking at Index, 7/22","Pictures of aid climbing are more boring than pictures of bouldering, so I didn't take any.  Instead, I will explore the Eric Gratz-style \""images.google.com\""-form in the following TR.\
\
For reasons too sordid and numerous to enumerate, but mostly having to do with my inability to plan more than a day ahead, I had no partner on Saturday.  So I lounged around the house until I couldn't stand it anymore, then packed up a big sack full of doodads and widgets plus four liters of water and stepped out into the scorching, Texas-like heat:\
\
[img:36hp7b3z]http&#58;//agnews&#46;tamu&#46;edu/dailynews/stories/CROP/photos/Mar0805b-lr&#46;jpg[/img:36hp7b3z]\
\
I got to Index around 5pm and hiked the brutal two minutes to the base of the Lower Town Wall.  There weren't many people there, so I tied off a tree in front of Japanese Gardens (a popular free route) and festooned myself with gear, intending to aid the Stern Farmer.\
\
[img:36hp7b3z]http&#58;//xroads&#46;virginia&#46;edu/~1930s/PRINT/document/famous/farmer&#46;jpg[/img:36hp7b3z]\
\
I tested out my solo belay device (a Soloist) by hanging on my first piece and it seemed I had rigged it correctly.  The first part of the pitch was awkward for aiding.  Below the first bolt, there's a mantel move where Jap Gardens moves left; that kind of free move still weirds me out with aiders dangling, ready to trip me up.  The rope wasn't feeding smoothly through the Soloist, which would cost me much extra time and effort the rest of the climb.\
\
[img:36hp7b3z]http&#58;//www&#46;edinphoto&#46;org&#46;uk/0_MY_P_S/0_my_photographs_scotland_-_pitlochry_games_00962_tug-of-war&#46;jpg[/img:36hp7b3z]\
\
Above and right of the bolt, in the thin corner crack that makes up Stern Farmer's first pitch, there's another mantel ledge.  I tried a three-pronged BD Talon hook in a couple places on the ledge and moved up onto it:\
\
[img:36hp7b3z]http&#58;//www&#46;acmeclimbing&#46;com/ProductImages/blackdiamond/talonsm&#46;jpg[/img:36hp7b3z]\
\
*Ping!*  I was now hanging comfortably from the bolt again.  The party that had just arrived around the corner gave me a funny look.  I tried a cam hook next, wedging it into a little diagonal seam next to the ledge:\
\
[img:36hp7b3z]http&#58;//www&#46;backcountrygear&#46;com/images/leepercamhooks&#46;jpg[/img:36hp7b3z]\
\
This one held, so I stuffed a yellow Alien into a squarish pin scar above.  Only two lobes were really in there, but they looked OK and felt solid.  Step up, *rip!*.  This time I hung from my daisy chain, still attached to the cam hook wedged in the seam.  I was pretty impressed with the cam hook idea at this point.\
\
[img:36hp7b3z]http&#58;//www&#46;ccad&#46;ac&#46;uk/Images/News%20-%20Success%20-%20Events/LuckyMan/golly%20gosh&#46;jpg[/img:36hp7b3z]\
\
I flipped the Alien over and got all four lobes mostly in this time.  Then it was off to the races... except for the constant fiddling with the Soloist, trying to get the rope to feed smoothly.  I had to stop at nearly every piece and yard on the rope at my waist to give myself enough slack to ascend.  Even though I put a cam hook in almost every other move on the upper part of the route, it still took me at least two hours to climb less than 100 feet.  Fun!\
\
I was relieved to reach the anchor, fix the rope, and rappel.  I can't remember the last time I was so completely drenched in sweat.  Underneath my kneepads, my pants were soaked to the ankle.  My t-shirt was fully saturated.  My shoulders ached from taking the strain of pulling the rope through the Soloist.  I hadn't been this worked in a long time.\
\
[img:36hp7b3z]http&#58;//www&#46;horizonsunlimited&#46;com/tstories/fitzpatrick/images/nioro%20sweat&#46;JPG[/img:36hp7b3z]\
\
I'm sure I did something wrong rigging the Soloist, but I haven't figured it out yet.  It did hold my falls, so nothing was fundamentally wrong, but pulling against the extra tension sure made for an exhausting ordeal in the ninety-degree heat.\
\
Unfortunately, this was not waiting for me at the car to hose me down:\

,"Paddy-Go-Easy Pass to Robin Lakes","Dylan answered my request for a \""mellow\"" lakes trip and brought along Tyler and Kim.  Knowing that it was going to be hot, we left Seattle at 6 AM.  We were pleasantly surprised that it was overcast, and we made quick time to Paddy-Go-Easy Pass (this trail doesn't screw around the way that Cascade Pass, Longs Pass, and Blue Lake do).\
\
Wildflowers were great, and the cloudy sky made for great photography.\

\
We rested and took a swim in Sprite Lake.\
\
Then we started up the ridge, which for the first half, is the rough red rock found on Ingalls.  \
\

\
Abruptly the rock changed to granite.\
\
The ridge was adventure-scrambling, with the occasional turn-around from a highpoint because it was too darn steep on the other side.  Given the others' skill levels we didn't bag all the highpoints (traversed past them) -- apparently there's a mineshaft on one of them.\
\
We made camp at some half-melted tarns on the flanks of Granite Mountain.  I was happy to have my GoLite Lair2 Nest bug shelter.\
\
The clouds started to clear as the temperature cooled, and the setting sun set them afire.\
\

\
I got up before dawn and tagged the summit of South Granite.  The register dated from Sept 2005, and the only signers since were a party led by the Goodmans (they're everywhere!).  The sunrise was muted, so while pretty and enjoyable, I didn't get any photos that really wowed me.  Guess I've seen a lot of dramatic sunrises.\
\
I got back to camp and woke everyone up.  After breakfast and packing up, we tromped up to the summit of (North) Granite and soaked in the views.  Mt. Baring, The Cradle, Stuey, Daniel, Snoqualmie Pickets, and four volcanoes.  \
\
We hiked down to Robin Lakes, where we took a swim and watched the goats.\

Then we hiked down to Tuck Lake, following cairns at first to the north (GreenTrails has it labeled but not USGS).  \

\
At Tuck Pot, we met a group of three and played a cool frisbee game (175 grams -- I didn't skimp!).  We stood on rock islands about 100 feet apart and tried to throw the frisbee to each other.  The hilarious result was a lot of diving into the water and missed catches.\
\

\
We then hiked out past Hyas Lake, feeling sorry for all the people hiking up in the heat.  At the trailhead, we still had a mile of hot dusty road to get back to our car.  A kind couple let us hop in the back of their pickup truck.\

\
I was amazed by the solitude we encountered on a prime summer weekend.  There was a family camped on the other side of Sprite Lake, but otherwise, until we got down to Tuck Lake, we didn't see another soul."
"mount-saint-helens","Opening weekend on Mt. St. Helens","I went with some friends do Mt. St. Helens this last weekend. The trip didn't start out so good, as I was stung by a yellow jacket before we had even gotten in the car to go up there. Needless to say I woke up in a Benadryl stupor in the car, almost to the mountain, realizing that I did not have my hiking boots. I left them at home. Oops. At least I had my flip flops...\
\
We woke up at around 4:00ish at the crowded climbers Bivouac, much earlier than we intended because of the overall noise made by the other campers. We were underway by 4:45. We briskly walked through the trees as the sun meddled the color of the clouds. \

"Mount-pugh","Pugh Workout - 7/27/2006","I was looking for a workout and with 5,500 ft of elevation gain Mount Pugh seemed to fit the bill. I wanted to hike this mountain when I was younger, but never got a chance to do it until now. No gear of any kind is required anymore and the trail crews removed any impediment that might slow progress making the trail in great shape. I got to wear running shoes, footwear that I am much more accustomed to using. My feet were happy for it! There were also no bugs at all - a welcome respite from the barrage encountered elsewhere. \

\
I was hoping for two hours worth of ascent after Mount Si only took one hour and I got my wish. Starting at the car at 9:35, I walked swiftly up the switchbacks and then the very easy marked scramble from Stujack Pass, reaching the summit at 11:30 – 1 hour and 55 minutes. \

\
Pieces of the old lookout, tetanus nails, and cables were strewn about the summit; seems like a lot of history up there. After a nice rest on top, I headed down, taking photos in the meadows. I jogged to the car once I entered the woods, where the trail is nice and cushy for shock absorption – 1 hour 30 minutes for the descent. \
\
Great wildflowers up to Stujack Pass; it seems like this is a blockbuster year for wildflowers. You guys are probably jaded by wildflower photos, but here are a few more...\

Gear Notes –\
The entire climb if you don’t count the bonus pitch can be done with bolts.  There are a few spots to place gear if you want, but you don’t need to.  The final 10b take gear in some spots and has bolts for unprotectable slabs in between.  Standard TCUs (or the like) and one #2 Camelot sized piece should suffice.  Also, all the raps are double rope raps."

We climbed the East Ridge of Forbidden, leaving our boots, axes, and pons at the base (a snaffle nibbled on our boots overnight).  Up top, we cooked a gourmet meal of tortellini with sundried tomato antipasto and goat cheese, plus some miso soup and avocado.  We bivied just below the summit (there's a nice spot for one person about 20 feet below to the north, slept tied-in).  After breakfast, we downclimbed the West Ridge and climbed back up.  We descended the East Ledges with 6 single-rope rappels and then hiked out.  We were surprised by the solitude we found in what is supposed to be a popular place.\

"The-tooth","The Tooth - Saturday","Taking a break from her summer in Rainier NP, Crystal Raymond drove up and climbed the South Face of the Tooth with me on Saturday.  It was a good climb, although easier than I expected.  It was my first full lead up a mountain, so I had fun.  We climbed it in three pitches and were able to do just three rappels with some down climbing on the first rappel.  That was just a little exposed, but I’m getting better with that stuff   <!-- s:) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\"" alt=\"":)\"" title=\""Smile\"" /><!-- s:) --> .  Actually, the scariest moves on the whole trip were when we were “off route” getting to pineapple pass.  We went up the first gully one comes to when traversing on the west side of the ridge, where Crystal soon became convinced we were not in the 3rd class gully described by Nelson.  I, however, decided I would do a couple 5th class moves to top out and see exactly where we were.  Well, we were above the pass, opposite the south face.  So, I scrambled down that steep slope and met Crystal in the real pineapple pass.   (There was a rappel station at the top of that 4th class gully, so I guess others have made that mistake and rappelled back down instead of topping out.)\
\
The route is very mellow and it never really feels airy either, so if you’re looking for a good first alpine lead, I’d recommend the Tooth.  But do it during the week, if you don’t want to be waiting behind several slow parties.  Also folks were rappelling when we were climbing which just added to the congestion.  \
\
I may be able to scrounge up some pictures later, but most of you know what this climb looks like I’m sure."

"Mount-stuart","Stuart Comp. North Ridge w/ gendarme-31(?) pitches of bliss","Since I had no takers on my invitation for Rainier or Stuart, I called up an old friend and asked if he would be up for the quest. We had never been in the area before, on Stuart or knew much of the route, so I figured two days to do the complete North Ridge with gendarme. 31 pitches, I had the fortunate experience to lead them all (no sarcasm).  \
	 After a gorgeous mosquito infested approach from the Stuart lake trailhead, we reached the base of the climb, rather late. We started late because I decided to get a permit since I had no idea how strict they would be there. We ate lunch at the base of Stuart Glacier and enjoyed swatting away the bugs that were swarming around our heads. After a fast shoe glacaide to the base of the lower portion of the North Ridge, we began the climb.\
  	The first few pitches aren’t bad, just needed to find the right ledge to start. We were following another team of climbers and had to wait a little here and there, they were finding the route. Not saying that we would be faster, we had no better idea which way the route went. Becky’s guide has a good description. We opted for twin ropes in case of a need for a quick rap. Started out linking up pitch 1 and 2, a lay back 5.7 with a chimney slot 5.8. Had to leave the pack on a piece of pro so I could squeeze through. Had to take off the helmet and attach it to my harness too. Damn, I must have a fat head. My friend helped haul it through the chimney by attaching it to one of the twin ropes. After this came a nice 5.9 layback pitch, followed by some 5.7 and then simu-climbing. If we correctly followed the route, the simu-climbing would have been easy, fortunately I didn’t and lead us up a route that I would say had some 5.7 and 5.8 moves. Not bad, still placed pro. After which we made it to a small bivy site. Made camp here, slept in our bivy, swatted the bugs, ate some dinner and watched a gorgeous sunset. \
	After a night of fighting the mosquitoes we left camp early and started simu-climbing behind the same team. Still mid fifth climbing except for a few 5.7 and 5.8 moves and another chimney. Damn it. Here I opted to clove hitch my pack to the rope and climb through. Not an easy task as I was already part way through the chimney and little features to work with and leading. After climbing through, I put it back on and continued simu climbing until we reached the notch at the start of the upper North Ridge. \
	When we reached the notch, we melted some snow to make water and continued. From here the route is a great deal more obvious. Just follow the polished route. So I lead the simu-climbing to the gendarme. A few great moves but mainly easy climbing. At the base of the gendarme, we dropped our packs and I lead the 5.9 layback pitch. A wonderful climb, just layback the whole thing. After setting the anchor I hauled the packs up and belayed my friend. Then continued the same idea for the off width 5.9. Lead, hauled and belayed. It went faster than I thought. \
	After heaving the packs back on, we simuled to the summit. A party before us left a #3 cam in the 5.8 spot. We couldn’t get it out, despite the fact that I saw how he placed it. After reaching the summit, we were ready to get down. Our packs were too heavy for the climb, should’ve gone lighter. That was our mistake. If I were to do it again, I would bivy at Ingalls lake or Stuart lake and do it all in one day with a light pack. I enjoyed leading all 31 pitches though. What a great climb. But now the descent. . . . always the worst part."
"index","Index LTW","Gordy Smith and I went to Index for half a day today. \
\
Did the standard warmup up GNS and then did BoC, RC, and G-M.  \
\
Damn, the 3rd pitch of G-M would be a lot friendlier with a second #4 friend.  I ended up placing the #5 and backcleaned the #4 so I could place it again.\
\
Gordy,. with his forestry training, spotted an injured tree about 20 feet to the left halfway up G-M.  Ping, snap goes the girdling webbing, and the tree was much happier.\
\
After we did BoA, I TRed MK with a loose belay and 3 falls.  I could do the moves, but I didn't have the strength-endurance to link them all together (and I was \""TR-onsighting\"" it too).  The point is that it's something that I should be able to work on to the point where I could lead it.\
\
Now, on the other hand, I have no idea how the fuck the unprotected start to G-M is 5.10..."
"Chair-peak","Chair Peak","Mark Swanson and I wandered up Chair Peak on saturday - a nice quick alpine outing and a first time for me in the area! For all my trips further out it was nice to try something close. \
\
We approached via the snow lake divide, which contains some scenic alpine gardens overlooking the lake amidst polished rock, a nice alternative to the boulderfields in the east basin. There was some ropework involved on the ridge, but it really felt more like scrambling... The descent went through a slot canyon on the southeast side which had some neat rappels overhanging caves -\
\
We met a friendly group of Mounties, an intriguing family of Canadians, lots of dayhikers on the way out, a pack of dogs (friendly), and one frog. In going with tradition set by Gary last year, I think that this is a great place for a picnic!\
\
I will post a few images as soon as I can figure out how to link them from picassa. Otherwise is there a way to upload a pic directly to the site (without uploading to an external site first?)\

"Del-campo-peak","Del Campo Por el Norte","Back in June, when there was actually still a lot of snow around, Christina and I took a trip to Del Campo. We took a non-standard approach from the north next to Morningstar Peak to get a good sampling of cross-country travel in the Cascades.\
\
Here is a link to a spiffy picassa slideshow!\
\
[url:2gkh052d]http&#58;//picasaweb&#46;google&#46;com/kevinsteffa/06_06_DelCampo[/url:2gkh052d]\
\
\
Short Version:\
\
From the trailhead to Vesper peak, there is an old route branching from a cabin ruin leading up to the back of the main valley, the headwaters of the Stilliguamish. This route was initially scouted by Phil Fortier, then Chris Cass for skiing potential, and by Brian Polagye for accessing Morningstar. We followed it all the way up to the saddle between Morningstar and DelCampo where we set up camp, and the next day took the snowfields to the summit block.\
\
\
Long Version:\
\
In keeping with the theme from some of my first trips to the cascades from an earlier age, a short description follows like the levels of a classic adventure game: \
\
Stage 1: In the forest. The path is distinct, and here the player can get familiar with the controls and the moves of the character. A few critters are encountered of the mostly benign sort. Frogs, Ferns, and Flowers. An obstacle is encountered, a washed out bridge over a rushing creek to hop, but nothing too sporting. This stage ends at the old cabin site, where clues are gathered, and the real adventure begins.\
\
Stage 2: The Brushlands. The old trail is followed fairly easilty at first. The brush looks menacing, but progress is still fast, and the tread is distinct. A lot of the brush is bracken fields, vine maple, and some salmonberry. The more devious slide alder only appears sporadically. In season, ample berries would keep the life meter replenished. Soon, there is less brush, and then there are boulders. Some flags lead the way through. This stage ends when the flags lead in multiple directions, and the path dissapears across a small creek. A little true 'schwackin' for about 100m marks the end of the stage.\
\
Stage 3: The River. The players continue along on some open river gravels, and the grade steepens. Boulder hopping replaces the trail. In one place a crossing is forced, and the players are first tested on their 'double-jump' ability. This stage ends at a fork in the stream. The piles of boulders here attest to the powers of the 'flood giant' who guards the gates to the next stage, but luckily this beast has been dormant since october 2003.\
\
Stage 4: The Canyon. We stay to the left, following the main rivercourse into a narrowing canyon. We question whether this stage is passable, but we press on the left side and are not forced into any more crossings. The river pounds away between large boulders and the smooth slabs coming off Morningstar. The crux of the stage turns out to be traversing a mossy sloping slab using vines to belay - not to challenging in 'easy' mode (dry weather) but could be sporting in 'hard' mode (rain or ice).\
\
Stage 5: The Hall of the Mountain King. We emerge from the canyon in a splendid little meadow near 4000'. No bootpaths cross this meadow and it feels as remote as the border region near Redoubt. The rush of the river dies as it runs underground. The mountain also first comes into view here, and the snow starts justs ahead, continuing in a long ribbon up to the pass. As the Morningstar slabs converge on the basin with another drainage, huge piles of avalanched snow attest to the power of the Mountain King. This stage ends at the pass.\
\
Stage 6: The Upper Snowfields. Here the players pick up some items and learn some new moves. The ice axe arrest, and the 'spiked boots'. The route ahead looks steep, and the snow apprears to deadend into vertical bands of rock. The feeling is distinctly alpine now and there are places where moats have peeled from the rock, and blocks of ice have slid off of steeper smoother sections into piles. Yet the route zigzags between the steeper sections, staying at a moderate grade and even flattining out in a series of basins. A final steeper section with a good runout into a flat basin leads to the base of a vertical wall where the snow appears to deadend, but turns into a mellow ramp leading to the skyline.\
\
Final Stage: The Castle in the Sky. The scenery is stunning now, and the graphics engine is being pushed to its rendering limits! From Ngo Knob, the outcrop at the top of the snowfields, there are several options now, and the players are finally tested with some rock scrambling moves. Directly from the knob, there is a striking chimney feature that parallels the vertical walls above the snowfields. It is mostly 3rd class here with a few solid 4th class moves to get around a chokstone. A short goat trail also leads around the corner to an overlook of Gothic Basin, cloaked still in snow with only a tiny blue melted patch in the lake. With more time, a short descent on snow can bring one to the easier route (class 2-3) which climbs the northeast slope of the mountain. \
\
\
Alas, at this point we have had a full day of exploring, and our energy meters are starting to get low - there just aren't powerups to be found scattered everywhere at this point in the game. And of course game characters usually dont have to think about descending, so we begin the descent and make it back to the trailhead at sunset."
"Glacier-peak","Glacier Peak Day Trip: 8/13/2006","Colin Abercrombie and I climbed Glacier Peak as a day trip via the White Chuck Basin/Disappointment Peak Cleaver route in 16 hours, 45 minutes round trip (9 hours up, 1.25 hour on top, 6.5 hours down). We came in through the now standard NF Sauk River Trail. It was a great climb with good route conditions and weather. Our route entailed 35+ miles (21 miles on trail) and 11,000 feet of total elevation gain (8,500 net elevation gain) - a really good endurance climb.  \

\
After getting a few hours rest, we set off at 2:45 am from the North Fork Sauk trailhead and pushed through the 9 miles to White Pass as twilight was commencing. We saw two black bears along the way resting in the lush alpine meadows. Continuing on an informal path to a saddle and then up to a knob provided a great viewpoint of Sloan just as the sun was rising. \

\
We descended into the barren, flat basin and hiked up to the moraines and rubble below White Chuck Glacier. Anybody who doesn’t believe in global warming should visit this area. I knew the glacier had receded, but was surprised to see that the entire West lobe is basically gone. Aside from a remnant ice patch near the glacial lake, there wasn’t even any snow left in the climb up to glacier gap. This area needs a mini ice age to reverse the shocking trend. \

 \
While our time estimates proved to be accurate for ourselves, the route is longer and more convoluted (in a non-technical sense) than originally thought. This route makes for a long day in the mountains, but I enjoyed almost every minute of it. Despite day-tripping, we were able to capture the views in all different light angles. I saw a special part of the cascades I had yet to explore and I will definitely return for some more climbs. \

Notes: NF Sauk brushed and cleared of logs except for one giant old growth tree that fell over the trail while we were on the mountain. You just walk under it, but it was surprising to see it on the way out - must have been a thunderous fall!"
"Prusik-peak","Prusik Peak","After our Rainier plans fell through, Margie and I were looking for something to climb. Over beers at the Latona Pub, Stephanie and Dallas recommended the W Ridge of Prusik (with a bug net of some sort) as an enjoyable outing. Thus, with modest hangs-over we set out on the Snow Lakes trail Sunday afternoon. \
\
We arrived at our pleasant campsite at Naiad Lake about 6.5 hours after leaving the TH, despite the eerie warnings of a backpack wearing soothsayer. (\""Where you going?\"" \""As close the base of Prusik as we can get.\"" \""That's not going to happen. You're dOOMed!\"") For the first time in a long time, our climb started after the sun woke us up. The north side of the W Ridge was pleasant, even as the temperatures climbed into the 80s. The route was straight forward with the only difficulties being way too much rope drag on the second pitch and getting off route on the final pitch. On the way down, we witnessed what appeared to be a group of three putting up a new route on the S Face (lots of hammering at pitons, etc.). Good luck to them. For us it was an enjoyable weekend in the hills. Pictures to follow, maybe..."
"Dragontail-peak","Dragontail - Brackbone ridge","Short TR: with a pizza divided between our packs, and a nice sunny day, we climbed Backbone. Fun times, good rock and lots of beautiful crack climbing.\

"West-mcmillan-spire","West McMillan Spire - 8/12-8/13/06","Jim, Charles, and I climbed West McMillan Spire last weekend in outstanding conditions.  A warning to those headed into the Goodell/Newhalem area: the signs saying that common ravens will destroy your wipers are very true.  We forgot to put rags over our wiper blades and returned to find the blades torn off and car covered in raven poop.  But that was the low point for the trip, so no point to dwell on it.\
\
The weather on a way up was overcast and we were a bit nervous that we'd be experiencing \""classic\"" Picket Range weather for the duration of the trip.\
\
[img:3khxcesf]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/79/216321528_91b8a6b7f3_m&#46;jpg[/img:3khxcesf] [img:3khxcesf]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/85/216321577_2c07f4dcbd_m&#46;jpg[/img:3khxcesf] [img:3khxcesf]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/57/216321467_d11f9583bf_m&#46;jpg[/img:3khxcesf]\
\
The trail sayed mostly in trees until about 5000' and then broke into spectacular vistas as we traversed towards Terror Basin.  We chose to descend and camp in the basin on a lovely bench at about 5750'.  Two marmots kept us company (and on our toes about food) for the duration of our all-too-brief visit.  Our site had outstanding views and the clouds cooperated by starting to break up.\
\

\
After recovering from the trip up (\""steep and sustained\"" doesn't really do the Terror Basin approach justice), Jim and I headed up the ridge to get a view of Azure Lake and ended up scrambling south to Pt. ~6750' which had great views in every direction.\
\
[img:3khxcesf]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/62/216321799_e9d44662b9_m&#46;jpg[/img:3khxcesf] [img:3khxcesf]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/92/216321843_0cb9f163a1_m&#46;jpg[/img:3khxcesf] [img:3khxcesf]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/89/216321856_98e9b5187b_m&#46;jpg[/img:3khxcesf]\
\
We thought about traversing further along to some of the higher peaks on the ridge, but hunger convinced us to head back to camp for dinner.\
\
Up at 4:00 the next morning, we headed up towards McMillan Spires.  We followed a series of rolling benches around 5600' to a cairned creek crossing (where we crossed paths with a porcupine) and then ascended splendid slabs to the base of the snow.\
\

\
Crampons were much appreciated as we ascended the snow (30 degrees max) to its highest point in the gully.  Great views of the Terror Glacier and peaks to the south.\

\
The gully to the notch at 7400' was rather loose and included a few mildly spicy traverse moves on ball bearing slabs, but that was as bad as it got.  From the saddle, we took a zig-zagging path of least resistance up the broad shoulder of the peak.  Were the slope narrowed, the rock quality improved greatly and made for tremendously fun scrambling (note how happy Charles and Jim look).\
\

\
Views from the top were spectacular and the exposure impressive, but the ridge never gets narrower than about 8 ft, so the pucker factor is quite low.\
\

\
The descent was time consuming (due to the looseness), but we enjoyed a great glissade back down to the slabs and returned to camp right around noon (7 hours after leaving).  On the way back we came across a stunning pool spanned by a snow arch.  I'm afraid the picture doesn't really do justice to the tranquility it exuded.\

\
From camp, it was an annoying slog back up to the 6200' saddle, a hot traverse, and bone jarring descent back to Goodell Creek.  Back to the car around 7:15, after leaving camp at 1:20.  And found that ravens had claimed our wipers and defiled the car.  Stupid ravens.  Finding the milkshake caboose in Marblemount closed was insult to injury, but did little to alter the balance of fun on the trip.\
\
Jim and I both commented that we've been saying this a lot over the summer, but this is now my favorite scramble.  Awesome scenery, remote wilderness, and solid rock when it counts."
,"DEB SEWS and EF LEXINGTON","Aaron and I drove up to washington pass for the weekend to do some climbing.  We arrived late friday and bivied at the blue lake trail head.  In the morning we drove to the last pullout before the hairpin to climb the direct east buttress on SEWS.\
[img:26jkm0vf]http&#58;//staff&#46;washington&#46;edu/killgoj/debsewseflex/001&#46;jpg[/img:26jkm0vf]\
  We werent quite sure which gully to head up, and we ended up cruising up the gully separating NEWS and SEWS.  We questioned our choice early on due to the looseness of the gully and we actually started heading down.  Unfortunately we changed our mind and continued up.  Tons of looseness and a few scrambling sections later we found an exit left to the treed rib which forms the lower buttress of news.  This provided very easy hiking and made our earlier decision seem only mildly dumb.  We arrived at the base of the climb soon and aaron headed up the first pitch.\
 [img:26jkm0vf]http&#58;//staff&#46;washington&#46;edu/killgoj/debsewseflex/002&#46;jpg[/img:26jkm0vf]\
We hoped to simul the first two pitches, but the rope hooked behind a flake and the drag forced aaron to belay.  The next pitch started over similar easy ground, and ended with some fun mid fifth climbing to a tree belay.  Next aaron led up a rotten slightly runout crack which quickly improved in quality before pulling a small 5.9 roof.  The next pitch started in an awesome 5.8 dihedral with fun moves, good rock and perfect stances.  The topo labeled a loose block at the top of dihedral, but it didn’t seem too dangerous.  Again the climbing eased off to 4th class before arriving at a nice comfy belay.\
[img:26jkm0vf]http&#58;//staff&#46;washington&#46;edu/killgoj/debsewseflex/0025&#46;jpg[/img:26jkm0vf]\
Aaron led the next pitch which started with some 5.8 moves before gaining the bolt ladder.  I was amazed at how heavily bolted the ladder was, with another bolt often in reach when the current bolt was at or above your waste.  Aaron led the pitch pretty quickly by French freeing the bolt ladder and mixing free and aid on the fun flake and crack.  I was able to free the pitch cleanly until reaching the crest of the buttress at which point the climbing seemed to get difficult so rather than waste time I pulled on a few bolts.  The flake and crack at the finish were really fun, although the move linking the features seemed pretty hard.  Aaron set up a rather uncomfortable semi hangin belay, but it seemed to be the best option.\
[img:26jkm0vf]http&#58;//staff&#46;washington&#46;edu/killgoj/debsewseflex/003&#46;jpg[/img:26jkm0vf] \
The next pitch heads out right with somewhat challenging poorly protected climbing.  Beckey calls it 5.8 and Kearney calls it 5.10.  I’m not really sure because I was more concerned about the pro than the climbing.  After reaching easier ground, the pitch moves back left to another bolt ladder.  The first bolt is easily skipped via moderate free climbing.  I dint bother trying to free the next couple of bolts and yarded my way up to the nice crack above.  This crack ended at an awkward mantle.  The mantle felt pretty hard and after pulling it I hoped that it was the 9+/10 mantle on the topo.  Unfortuneately an even more awkward mantle existed further up after another fun  steep crack section.  The next mantle took some thinking, but after figuring out the best holds it felt relatively secure.  This pitch had a super comfy belay, so I was happy.  Aaron followed quickly and was soon leading off on a fun and enjoyable 5.6 pitch.  I led a 5.4 pitch to the top of the buttress and some bolts.  I belayed aaron up and we looked all around for the supposed 5.4 step down to the main formation.  Not sure it was really 5.4, but aaron led down the stepdown, then threw in a cam, and give me a little shoulder stand lift to the ground.  Next we led off to find a comfy spot to lounge around and eat and drink.  It was still relatively early and we weren’t in much of a hurry.  Plus the S. Arete descent isn’t really something to dread, as it is pretty fun.  The downclimb went smooth until the raps at the bottom where one of the ropes managed wrap itself fifty or so times around a small tree.  Eventually we got the tangles out and soon were on the ground and plodding down the trail.  We found the early cutoff from the regular trail and made our way back down the highway to the car.  About a ¼ mile up we were picked up by a nice guy in a truck who gave us a ride back to the car.  We spent the evening reading guidebooks, eating pasta and playing cribbage at the cutthroat lake trailhead. \
\
This was a cool climb, but I kind of agree with a lot of other comments out there that some of the pitches aren’t great. The exposure and views on the other hand are awesome.  \
\
The next morning we slept in a little later before driving up to the first pullout to climb the EF of Lexington.  The approach was way easier than SEWS, following a perfect trail up to generally solid talus, with only a bit of crappy scree.  I got my first close up look of liberty crack and now want to climb it even more than before.  There was still a bunch of snow blocking the regular start of EF Lexington, so we started up the obvious gully/weakness to the climbers right of the face.  The gully afforded decent protection, relatively solid rock, and was actually pretty enjoyable.  An move left brought me to the 3rd class ledge shown on the topo.  Aaron led the next pitch which starts with some fun cracks before turning into sparsely protected face climbing.  The Beckey topo shows the line passing between three small but obvious roofs, however aaron found enjoyable easier looking climbing just to the left of the “regular” line.\
[img:26jkm0vf]http&#58;//staff&#46;washington&#46;edu/killgoj/debsewseflex/004&#46;jpg[/img:26jkm0vf]\
Next I linked the mid fifth 3rd pitch with the awesome 5.8 fourth pitch.  The 5.8 fourth pitch starts in some fun finger cracks before moving into a corner that ranges from fingers to offwidth.  The pitches linked well with a 60m rope (leaving maybe 10ft of excess to pull up).  Aaron led the next pitch which skirts a large roof (not shown in topos) on the left via very enjoyable 5.7 wide hands crack.  We had some brief discussion about where the route went because the prominent roof in the topo was supposedly skirted on the right.  Aaron’s intuition was correct however as a larger roof was ahead.  The next pitch is really spectacular.  It starts in an easier than it looks chimney, then moves right via a vey narrow foot traverse.  The route is supposed to go up a flake above the traverse, but I was more concerned about the exposed traverse and I completely missed the flake.  This mistake was exacerbated by the topo which clearly shows the flake at the end of the traverse.  Anyhow, as soon as the traverse was hand size, I dropped down and hand traversed all the way to the end.  The next finger crack is one of the best finger cracks I have ever I climbed.  I think it is part of tooth and claw, but I’m not certain (anybody know).  It starts right above a bolt anchor/rap station.  I noticed my mistake about halfway up the finger crack, however correcting at the point would require a difficult looking unprotected face traverse 10 ft to the left..   Instead I continued to the end of the finger crack where I found a reasonable downward traverse directly to the alcove belay bleow the wide cracks.\
\
I was happy that Aaron had drawn the crux wide pitch.  A #6 friend borrowed from Tom Lewis kept the pro overhead, and aaron pushed through to a belay after a runout chimney and a trickey move past a chockstone.  \
[img:26jkm0vf]http&#58;//staff&#46;washington&#46;edu/killgoj/debsewseflex/005&#46;jpg[/img:26jkm0vf]\
Contrary to the guidebooks, the bolts on this pitch appear to be fine (recently replaced?).  Following this pitch with our pack was a bear.  After pulling through the offwidth, aaron hauled the pack while I climbed the chimney.  I arrived at the belay tired and dehydrated from two days of climbing, and slightly nervous about the dirty offwidth ahead,  Right off the belay, my triceps started cramping pretty bad..  I made it to the end of the offwidth section, but my arms kept going dead.  After repeated offers from aaron to finish the pitch while I drank some water, I finally took him up on it.  Much rope shenanigans ensued and many many minutes later aaron was TRing up to the end of the first offwidth section.  More thuggish chimney and offwidth climbing eventually lead to a good sandy belay ledge.  I was feeling better after drinking some water, and soon met aaron at the belay before leading off on the last long easier pitch.  Fun, but somewhat dirty 5.6-5.7 climbing interspersed with easier ground brought me to a belay at the top of the east face.  I belayed aaron up and he set off on the easy 5.low pitch which traverses a cool easy exposed slab before ending at a treed ledge below the summit of Lexington.  Aaron was a bit nervous about the unknown descent as all the beckey topo and description says is walk off.  The main gully ahead looked way too steep, so we worked down and left eventually reaching a sunny spot with a view of easier ground.  We sat down here and ate and relaxed.  Soon we were back on well traveled ground cleaning the sand out of our shoes.  Aaron left his helmet here on accident, so if anyone sees it shoot him a PM. \
Again we repeated the walk down to the highway.  Aaron left me with all the gear and he jogged most of the way back to the car before getting picked up.  He picked me up shortly thereafter and we were on our way back to seattle.\
\
I think EF Lexington is the best climb I’ve done at WA pass.  Almost all of the pitches had some merit, and many were exceptional IMO.  I had mixed feelings about the off widths, but that is probably because I suck at climbing them."
"Little-annapurna","Solo day-hike up Little Annapurna","My hiking aspiration for the year has been to summit Little Annapurna.  Having grown up winter hiking in New Hampshire, I had a strong desire to test myself on the much higher summits out here.  Also, not wanting to get a camping pass, and unable to find anyone to hike at my pokey pace, I knew the ascent was going to have to be a solo day-hike.\
\
A key problem to hiking in the eastern cascades is the hot summer weather that seems to plaque the region, and when you can’t sweat this problem is magnified 10-fold.  Therefore, when the weather report forecasted a relatively cool 89oC high for Sunday, I knew that was as good a chance as any to reach the summit.  \
\
Saturday night, I packed my frame pack with 40 lbs of water, food, and emergency supplies, strapped it to the back of my 250cc crotch rocket, and headed out for Leavenworth at 10:30 PM Saturday.\
\
By 1:30AM, I reached the Colchuck Lake trailhead and headed out for Colchuck Lake.  I couldn’t help but envy those who had cars, and therefore got a good night’s sleep before tackling the mountain.  The hike up was pretty straightforward, and I even got to watch a fairly impressive meteor shower when I hit the clearings.\
\
By 3:45 AM, I had reached Colchuck Lake and decided to wait there for the sun to rise before attempting Aasgard Pass.  After reading Ira Spring’s review of the pass I was plenty ready for at least a Class 2-3 scramble; however, I was quite relieved to find that the pass was not a scramble, or even a boot path, but a formal non-technical trail whose only real challenge was the gain in elevation.\
\
At around 5:15 AM, The sun had started to rise so I continued around Colchuck Lake, past all the campers still sound asleep, and gained access to the boulder field below the pass.  There, I met the first people I’d seen since heading out.  They had also night hiked in, and were headed up Colchuck Glacier.\
\
I decided not to stick with the trail, and instead headed up the upper half of the boulder field, where I was rewarded with an odd little glacier and cascading waterfalls with little oases at the bottom.  Eventually, my route funneled into the trail up Aasgard pass, and I followed the trail the remainder of the way up.  \
\
Once I crested the pass, I was immediately struck by the nether-world appearance of the Upper Enchantments.  I continued to the southeast corner of the basin, and then scrambled the remaining 1100’ to the summit of Little Annapurna.  I was surprised at how difficult the altitude made this climb, where I was relegated to alternating between climbing over a just few boulders before I had to catch my breath again.  \
\
At 10:30 AM, I reached the summit. I was surprised to find neither mountain goats nor other hikers at the top, figuring the accessibility of this summit would make it a more popular climb.  After a quick rest and some pictures, I decided to try the Dragontail traverse as a short-cut down the mountain.  I climbed down a class 3 descent alongside a steep glacier only to find the route had a dead-end that was invisible from higher up.  After saying a few choice words, I climbed my way back out, and did a sitting glissade down one of the more accessible glaciers.\
\
At the top of Aasgard Pass, I saw my second hiker of the day, and decided to chat for a bit, as I hadn’t talked to anyone since early that morning.  As it turned out she was from Indiana, and had little to no experience hiking, so she decided to wait at the base of Dragontail while her friends ascended Dragontail Glacier to the summit.  I congratulated her on making it this far and figured this was another strike against Ira Spring where a novice hiker had no qualms ascending the pass.\
\
Once back to Colchuck Lake, I quickly descended to the trailhead in 2 hours.  I had been up since 9:00AM the Saturday morning, and was eager to get back so that I could both get back over the pass before night and get back home to my wife (and my nice comfy bed).  I reached the trailhead at 6:00 PM, and after a quick break packed up and headed out at 7:00 PM and was back home in Mill Creek by 10:30 PM (route 2 was backed up due to an accident of some sort).  \
\
All in all, I’d rate Little Annapurna as being a fun day hike well within the grasp of most any hiker.  However, having a car so that you can sleep at the trailhead the night before would be a major plus.\

"observation-rock","Observation Rock north face simul-solo 8/16","My friend Mike Burns and I decided to make a trip down to MRNP to solo the north face of Observation Rock and also scramble Echo Rock.   It sounds good, but it was a lot of hiking for 15 minutes of climbing.  He was triple dumbass and forgot to put his memory card in his camera, otherwise I would have some beautiful \""sea of clouds\"" photos to share.  The hike in was a little more efficient this time.  After doing this climb with Jeremy Bowler last year in similar conditions I shaved a little time off the approach with a more direct line to the start of the route.  Compared to last year there was less snow on the face.\
\
The NF of Observation has a broad, hourglass snow face that reaches about 60 degrees at its steepest, and is maybe not quite 400 feet tall.  It is a popular outing for its proximity to Seattle, ease of access, and straightforward climbing.   I have never gone on a weekend, but I hear the Mountaineers flock to it, so be prepared for other parties.\
\
At the base of the route I found a nice pile of booty- someone had dropped 2 Neutrinos, a locker, and a Mammut skinny double runner.  I pocketed those and we began climbing.  I spotted some webbing at a rock outcropping and Mike went over to investigate.  It looked like a rap anchor, and Mike tugged it out with two pulls.  Someone had, at some point, tried to rap off some dirt.\
\
Mike and I cruised up the face, chatting, enjoying the views, and using second tools near the top.  The snow was firm and secure and made for enjoyable climbing.  The only pro that would have been useful in these conditions is pickets.  All too soon the climbing was over and we hiked up to the top, where we entertained ourselves with making humorous entries in the summit register.\
\
Looking over at Echo we decided to skip it since it looked like an enormous pile of scree.  I felt I had slid around enough in that crap already, so we hiked out.  We saw one crevasse on the Flett Glacier and stepped right over it.  Tons of hikers were on the Wonderland.  We made it back to the car exactly 8 hours from when we left.\

"Sloan-peak","Sloan Peak - 8/17/06","Carla, Gabriel, and I climbed Sloan Peak on Thursday in amazing conditions.  After having been rained off nearly everything I tried in March/April of this year, the weather karma has been put into balance by this summer.\
\
Departed from the Cougar Creek TH a little before 7:00 am and headed along the somewhat brushy (but heavily flagged) trail to the river crossings.  One is no longer moving.  Another has an easy jump to get across.  The third requires a ford (knee deep, not moving too fast).  On the other side we donned our boots and headed up the sandy shore to the continuation of the climber's trail.  The trail was very easy to follow for the entire trip - brushy in parts, lots of deadfall, but mellow grade to the meadowy basins.  I can also report that the much feared Sloan Peak Bees have abandoned their stump and climbers can once again scramble over and around it without suffering under a withering barrage of hornets.  Much of the trail is in forest with only sporadic views, but there is a very nice waterfall just after crossing the wilderness boundary.\
\
[img:1xt0k4rz]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/81/218534610_5d04a94560_m&#46;jpg[/img:1xt0k4rz]\
\
The \""maintained\"" trail ends at about 4800' in a small basin.  From here a steep climber's trail ascends to a very scenic upper basin and onto the morraine of a long-retreated lobe of the Sloan Glacier.  While we had been walking below clouds for most of the morning, now we rose above them, with great views of the local peaks.\
\
[img:1xt0k4rz]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/74/218534638_10e28fde8f_m&#46;jpg[/img:1xt0k4rz] [img:1xt0k4rz]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/76/218534657_3e5c551f24_m&#46;jpg[/img:1xt0k4rz]\
\
The climber's trail ends at a large cairn on gravel covered slabs.  We headed up - Gabriel and Dicey on snow, me on rock, to a notch at about 6000'.\
\
[img:1xt0k4rz]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/57/218534690_50d9a16520_m&#46;jpg[/img:1xt0k4rz] [img:1xt0k4rz]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/69/218534709_8ea43319ca_m&#46;jpg[/img:1xt0k4rz] [img:1xt0k4rz]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/94/218534719_3df87890bd_m&#46;jpg[/img:1xt0k4rz]\

\
However, if you cut to climber's left at the cairn, and cross the outflow stream, you should find a climber's track continuing on heather and dirt nearly all the way to the notch (we followed this on the way down, but then missed the turn-off to get back to the slabs).  From the notch we scrambled easy slabs to the glacier and decided to rope up at the \""halfway\"" point between the upper and lower entries.  This resulted in a fair bit of zig-zagging to gain elevation.  The upper glacier is in much better shape than the lower.  Recommend getting on the glacier at the highest point possible - here there is relatively wide, rocky bench with plenty of room to rope up.  The glacier is very active.  Before, during, and after the crossing, we heard to dull boom of shifting ice several times.\
\
Once across the glacier, we followed the obvious climber's trail in a corkscrew around Sloan Peak.  Stash your glacier gear here - you won't need it the rest of the way up.  We encountered a Ptarmigan on the narrows trail, who clucked at us and then would walk ahead a few feet, wait for us to follow, and cluck again.  Looking behind us, we could see three Ptarmigan adolescents lurking in the shadows of a rock, so we played along and let her decoy us along the trail.\

\
The climber's trail ends at a relatively loose 3rd class gully with a stiff exit move (hardest climbing of the trip - but not that bad), and continued on broken rock and dusty benches to the summit proper.  Great views from here and we lounged for about an hour before heading down.  Familiar names in the ad hoc summit register - including a trip by Justin, Ted, and Ben (what's up with that weird quote, ben?) and one by Kevin Steffa and Chris from the previous year.\

"Dorado-needle","Dorado Needle and Eldorado Peak - 8/18-19/2006","Bjorn and I climbed the Northwest Ridge of Dorado Needle on Friday after doing the approach that morning and the East Ridge of Eldorado on Saturday for sunrise. The glaciers are in fine shape with no problems encountered. Fun routes, great views, superlative star gazing, and a great partner. \

We set out from the Eldorado Trailhead at 9:15 am and sweated up to the Eldorado Glacier, arriving at the base of the East Ridge of Eldorado at 12:45 pm. We enjoyed the blueberries above the stream crossing. We dropped our bivy gear at the East Ridge camp spots and worked on setting up some passive solar for water. After a little rest we set out for Dorado Needle at 1:30 pm. The Glaciers were in good shape and we made nice time up to the Needle. \

Notes: No snow until Eldo Glacier; Inspiration and upper McAllister Glaciers are in fine shape with no moat/schrund problems yet"
"Ingalls-peaks","north ingalls","took a quick run up the south ridge today.  the approach went by fairly fast (2-2.5hrs).  we only waited for one party (apparently the queues can get rather long) then made good time up and down the route; it's really easy but surprisingly fun!  finished with a dip in ingalls lake (freaking cold still and i lost my sunglasses in there <!-- s:( --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_sad.gif\"" alt=\"":(\"" title=\""Sad\"" /><!-- s:( --> ).  dinner at roslyn pizza made for a good sunday in the hills."
"Sloan-peak","Sloan Peak - W Ridge","After an inspirational TR from Alex and Rad of cc.com ([url=http&#58;//www&#46;cascadeclimbers&#46;com/threadz/showflat&#46;php?Cat=0&Board=UBB2&Number=593042:dire6bqw]TR[/url:dire6bqw]), Jesse and I decided to attempt a new variation on the W or SW Face of Sloan. We ended up climbing the W Ridge via a nice, not too steep defile just N of the ridge proper. Since we neglected to bring a camera, I’ve chosen to use a few photos lovingly liberated from the cc.com TR. \
\
The trail was fantastic as expected. We arrived at the Bedal Basin pass two hours after setting out. We roped up here and began simul-climbing up the W ridge. We pitched out one steep blank section (mid-fifth, slim pro) to enter the defile and then shortened our rope and simuled the remainder. There were a few low-fifth sections, but for the most part it was fourth class scrambling. \
\
We reached the summit six hours after leaving the car. Here we found excellent views of the pitiful N side glacier (complete with calving seracs – time is running out for the glacier and the corkscrew), an infestation of what appeared to be flying termites, and a poo-stained rock not fifteen feet from the register. Some crap-bag had decided to smear his or her excrement on a stone and [b:dire6bqw]not toss it off of the summit![/b:dire6bqw] \
\
Our descent, forced early by the stench, took five hours. We down-climbed through the upper shelf on the S Face (since we couldn’t find a rap anchor), then walked down the lower shelf to the pocket glacier. The moat required some creativity. We ended up passing underneath part of the moat before climbing up rock and onto the snow. ‘Twas fun. The sidehilling beneath the SW Face was not fun. Many swears were uttered. Many stones were trundled. Many slides were taken. We felt pretty beat up by the time we got back on the trail. It was worth it, though. I agree with Alex and Rad from cascadeclimbers in that there’s a lot of potential for big new lines on Sloan. \

Our line, which I dubbed \""Another Damn Song,\"" follows an inviting gully system below the W Ridge. Very reminiscent of the W Ridge of Stuart. \

"Forbidden-peak","Forbidden Peak, North Ridge 8/19-20","[b:16xq8fgw]Short version:[/b:16xq8fgw]\
\
Mike Schmitt and I climbed the North Ridge of Forbidden last weekend.  It was one of the best alpine routes I've done, with a rugged approach, tons of easy rock climbing, a scenic bivy, and exciting exposure ([url=http&#58;//www&#46;flickr&#46;com/photos/ralphbod/sets/72157594246087331/:16xq8fgw]photos[/url:16xq8fgw]).\

\
I thought I was going to die on the approach, Mike was going so fast.  I tried to slow him down by giving him the rope, but he just went faster after that, exclaiming that his pack felt lighter after repacking it.  I think we made it to the start of the meadows in 1:15.\
\
Thanks to AlpineDaveBurdick's [url=http&#58;//alpinedave&#46;com/forbidden/north_ridge/north_ridge&#46;htm:16xq8fgw]excellent description[/url:16xq8fgw], we found the easy way to cross over to the Boston Glacier.  Aim for the white rock below the V-notch right of Sharkfin Col, that's the correct gully.\

\
We rapped into the moat and Mike discovered that he had Yuko-sized crampons.  In the Bugaboos last week, he'd given his girlfriend his crampons, fitted with a small-sized connecting bar sawed down so they'd fit her feet.  Mike wears size 46.5 in mountain boots, so there was about two inches more foot than crampon.  He bashed and bent until he could lever them on with his ice axe:\

\
Crossing the Boston Glacier was fairly easy and we reached the bivy sites near the two towers low on the ridge in six hours from the car.  There was just enough room for two bivies on the exposed ridge&mdash;an awesome place to sleep, especially on a warm night like we had.\

\
We saw better bivy sites along the route the next day, but there's nothing like walking ten steps to the start of the first pitch in the morning.\
\
The plan was to climb the NW Face variation to the North Ridge.  We'd rap down to the glacier and climb about 600' of snow/ice to about 2/3 of the way up the ridge, then climb rock to the summit.  After eyeing the moat and rock band at the base of the face, and considering Mike's sketchy crampons, we agreed to just do the rock route.\
\

\
I led off and cleared the mandatory crux (5.5) to easier ground.  The first \""pitch\"" took us over the flat part of the ridge, sometimes walking, sometimes scrambling, on beautiful white rock.  I handed the lead over to Mike after a bit of mossier, steeper stuff that reminded me of Mt. Triumph.  His pitch brought us to the snow arete at the top of the ice face.  On went the crampons and we balanced across:\
\
[url=http&#58;//www&#46;flickr&#46;com/photos/ralphbod/221339947/in/set-72157594246087331/:16xq8fgw][img:16xq8fgw]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/83/221339947_d2cb44b014&#46;jpg[/img:16xq8fgw][/url:16xq8fgw]\
\
Mike broke a crampon taking it off after the snow section.  We felt better about not doing the ice variation.\
\
The ridge got steeper now.  My next lead went up a chimney right of the crest, then left on ledges.  Here it got scrambly, so I climbed a steep bit (5.7) past a fixed Friend back to the crest.  The rope drag was awful here, so I brought Mike up to a belay.  He led the rest of the way to the summit.  This last section was like the North Ridge of Stuart between the notch and the gendarme, fun and exposed on great rock.\
\
We descended the East Ledges roped-up with a running belay:\
\

\
The descent was like walking down into an oven, but at least the bugs weren't bad.  At the Boston Basin campsites, a woman asked us if our route was \""an intermediate climb\"".  Why do I get mistaken for a Mountaineer?\
\
Clean shorts and flip-flops awaited me at the car.  Mike was proud of his light-and-fast packing job.  Look at his ridiculous little pack!  Compared to this, I truly am a Mountie:\

\
On the way home, we took the scenic Concrete-Sauk Valley Road, catching great views of Baker, Shuksan, and even the west side of the Marble Creek Cirque, among other peaks.  Both this drive and the route we climbed are highly recommended."
"Snowking-mountain","Snowking Scramble route","My friend Amber and I scrambled the east ridge of Snowking Sunday via the Kindy Ridge Route on Saturday.  It was beautiful weather, and the route is about class II at the most, we didn't need the ice axes we brought, and helmets are not really necessary because the summit block is really short, and the rest of it isn't exposed to rock fall.  It took us a little over 2 hours to summit from the lake.\
\
The approach is much longer than I expected, with a couple significant high points that you gain and drop elevation on before you get to Cyclone Lake.  Also, we walked probably 2.5 miles on the FS road because of a huge downed log and wash-out.  We also missed the \""obvious\"" climbers trail that leaves from the end of the road directly left.  We went straight (this is WRONG!), and ended up bush-wacking our way south for 2.5 hours before a friendly man yelled to us from several hundred feet away (probably because he could hear us cussing up a storm) and we joined them on the trail.  Also, there's no water after the first 1/2 mi of trail until you get to the lakes, so bring plenty for the long hike in. \
\
Gear list: sleeping bag, pad, food, water, filter (if you're into that), hiking boots or shoes \
Tip #1:  Follow the pink flagging!\
Tip #2:  If you plan on driving in late at night, go slow on the FS Road otherwise you'll bottom-out on some pretty nasty ditches and bust your exhaust pipe and then have to drive the 3 hours home sounding like a friggin' airplane with everyone looking at you like you're crazy . . .  <!-- s:? --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_confused.gif\"" alt=\"":?\"" title=\""Confused\"" /><!-- s:? -->"
"Vesper-peak","North Face of Vesper Peak - 8/12","It has long been on my list of climbs, expecially because I am currently in a love/hate relationship with slab climbing and Jeremy Holleman answered the call.  We left Seattle around 8 and got an alpine start hiking after 10.  We did make quick work of the approach, although I didn't enjoy the fact that the entire trail is scree/talus.  After finally finding the correct pass to drop into the vesper glacier and lots of lots of debating about which is the obvious depression Nelson describes, we opted to scramble across the face above the first pitch to avoid the loose pitch and nasty looking moats.  Once we found our way onto the slab, three enjoyable pitches on solid rock with good protection was to be had.  We had the route and summit to ourselves with great views all around.  Pictures to come.\

,"Alpine Lakes Solo Epic","This past weekend I intended to connect the Necklace Valley trail with the West Fork Foss River Trail via the Alpine Lakes High Route.  A broken probe in our lab on Friday meant that I needed to work Saturday.  Fortunately by 4 pm I was on my way and reached the trailhead at about 6 pm.  At this point my trip had become a late Saturday to Monday trip.  A friendly group of hikers helped me with my car shuttle and I hit the trail.  I hiked in a couple hours before making camp in a small clearing.\
\
The next morning I headed up into Necklace Valley and enjoyed the views of the lakes.  I especially enjoyed Lake Ilswoot, which in my opinion should have been the one named Emerald.  It was a spectacular blue-green color.  The whole valley was quite beautiful.  I continued upwards toward Tank Lakes.  Again I was greeted by amazing views and stunning lakes.  From the lakes, I headed to Iron Cap Pass and then started to make my way up the east flank of Iron Cap Mountain.  I got cliffed out as I made my way up to the gap.  At this point I was running low on water, so I headed down to a small stream coming off a snow patch.  \
\
After pumping, I noticed that I could not get a deep breath and it was quite painful to breath.  I had no idea what exactly was wrong, how serious it was, of if my condition would get worse with time.  This is a scary realization when you’re off trail and alone in the mountains.  The only thing I ruled out was a heart attack; my signs and symptoms weren’t right.  I rested for a bit and decided I needed to get back to the trail.  I thought about staying put, but it would be 48 hours before I was missed and longer before I was found.  I wasn’t sure how life threatening my condition was.  It was now 6:30 PM and I slowly started making my way back to Tank Lakes.  As I made my way across the talus slopes, I started monologueing to help keep me focused and to keep my fear in check.  By the time I reached the head of Necklace Valley, it was too dark to find the trail.  I decided to set up camp.  The pain in my chest had worsened and it was still difficult to breath.  I ate and wrote in my journal before dozing off.\
\
I awoke an hour and a half later in more pain (around 11:30 PM), which lessened when I sat up.  I couldn’t fall asleep again, so I decided I would follow the river down to the lakes and pick up the trail.  Fortunately I stumbled across a path and was able to follow it by headlamp.  The paths in the valley fade in and out as they cross streams and talus, but I seemed to be able to find another each time I lost it.  Eventually I made it to what I thought was a cliff with mist and lights down at the bottom.  After a few minutes of puzzling about where I was, I realized I was standing on the shore of Opal Lake.  The lights I saw were my headlamp reflecting off fish and the cliff and mist were an optical illusion.  Ah, how the darkness and mind can play tricks.  Once I realized where I was, it was not too difficult to get down to Emerald and Jade lakes.  Here the trail becomes extremely obvious, and it was easy to follow.  \
\
Around 3:30 AM, I was feeling really, really tired so I put on my puffy, leaned against my pack and dozed until 5 AM.  I woke feeling a little better.  The pain while breathing was not as intense.  I slowly continued my way back to the trailhead.  The rest of the way out was slow and steady with periodic rests and I reached the trailhead about 9 AM.  I dropped my pack and another 50 min of walking got me to the West Fork Foss River Trailhead.\
\
Back in Seattle, I paid a visit to the doctor.  After a lot of questions, listening to my breath, and X-rays, she determined that I had a spontaneous, partial lung collapse.  She told me that it would get better on its own provided that I take it easy and rest over the next week or so.  Already breathing is easier and far less painful.  \
\
Thinking back on other trips I’ve taken, this is by far the scariest 15 hours I’ve ever spent in the woods.  My fear was definitely compounded by being alone, far from the trail when the problem started, and not being able to ID the problem or knowing its severity.  Still, Necklace Valley and Tank Lakes are beautiful areas that I hope to return to so that I can fully enjoy this loop though the Alpine Lakes."
"snow-creek-wall","Outer Space","For those thinking of doing Outer Space this summer, watch out for the yellow jacket nest on the second pitch, the 5.8 traverse. They are in the crack by the stuck Alien and get agitated easily. So don’t clip it if you can get away with it. On the 4th pitch, the 5.8 crack to 5.9 right traversing crack, the leader doesn't need to bring any pro, there is enough pro stuck in the rock. There is a stuck cam, alien, slings on a horn, a nut and a piton. Which i find to be aesthetically disgusting. But that's what happens on climbs."
"Del-campo-peak","Del Campo Workout - 8/25/2006","I got a good workout on Del Campo, ascending in 1 hour and 55 minutes. I took a 45 minute break on top and then descended in 1 hour, 35 minutes (4 hour, 15 minute round trip). The only hike I've done in that section of the Mtn. Loop Hwy is Dickerman so it was nice to explore a new area and get around 4,500 feet of elevation gain in the process. \

\
The trail up to Gothic Basin is quite steep, but in good condition. There is no snow left on route to the summit. From the basin, there was less Del Campo above than I thought there would be, but it's only 6,600 after all... \

\
The scramble was fun and the views were great. I relaxed and took some self-timer photos. The biggest surprise was Foggy Lake, a larger lake than I imagined and beautifully neslted between Gothic Peak and Del Campo. No fog on the lake today, it shimmered in the sunlight and was very photogenic. \

On the way out I startled a cinammon black bear right in front of me, but before I could whip the camera out it was thundering into the bushes. I didn't see anyone until well down the trail on the descent. \

I became an uncle as well! My sister gave birth to a girl early that morning. Her name is Tamar (it means \""palm tree\""). Once I found out, the climb had to be short and sweet so I could visit her in the afternoon. The baby in this photo is only 14 hours old!

"Prusik-peak","Burgner Stanley Prusik Peak","I climbed the Burgner Stanley (aka south face west, aka chockstone route) on the south face of prussik this weekend.  This route was at the very top of things I wanted to climb this summer, so I was super stoked to get out and do it.  Since most of my usual partners were busy this weekend, I posted on cc.com looking for a partner.  Jake (sjwages), who I climbed NF Burgundy with last year, was one of those who replied and he was game to do the south face.  \
\
We left my house at about 5:00AM Saturday morning and made good time to the leavenworth ranger station.  They give out permits at 7:45 daily, so wound up with some time to kill.  It turns out somebody stole a reserved permit from the self serve box, so the rangers were extra late getting started with the lottery process.  Anyhow, my name was drawn first so we didn't even have to suffer anxiously through the ordeal.\
\
This was my first time hiking the snow creek trail past snow creek wall, so I took some time to take pictures while still maintaining a good pace.\
\
Here are some pictures from the approach:\

\
We reached the base of the climb at about 2:30.  The route has cool hangers on it to keep your packs out of reach of the goats.\
\
[img:3jhxwo57]http&#58;//staff&#46;washington&#46;edu/~killgoj/Prussik%20S%20Face/sahale%20032&#46;jpg[/img:3jhxwo57]\
\
On the approach we talked about whether it would be better to climb the route Saturday or Sunday.  Jake had already done the descent, so we weren’t too worried about rapping in the dark.  Given the shade, temps, and sunset views, we decided that if we reached the base of the climb by 2:00, we should just climb it so that we could have a leisurely Sunday.  \
\
Anyhow, 3:00 isnt much later than 2:00, so we decided to go for it.  We started the climb up the 5.8 off width.  This pitch is mostly bomber fun jams with just a few wideish moves to keep it sporting.  The pitch is easily linked with the 4th class second pitch with a 60m rope.\
\
Jake coming up the first pitch:\
[img:3jhxwo57]http&#58;//staff&#46;washington&#46;edu/~killgoj/Prussik%20S%20Face/sahale%20035&#46;jpg[/img:3jhxwo57]\
\
Our second pitch moved up a nice finger crack before moving right on fun knobs and thin pro.  After the knobs I moved into a chimney, but it looked really dirty, so I down climbed and moved further right.  I started up a nice looking corner, but as I got higher, the cracks got dirtier.  Eventually I reach a difficult bulge where I looked left and saw the correct belay about 15 unprotected and difficult feet to my left.  After spending way to long trying to climb through the bulge, I eventually just lowered down and over to the proper chimney (where I had originally started), and finished the pitch.  Looking back at the bulge, continuing would have probably been bad as I don’t think we could have regained the real route.\
\
Our off route corner:\
\

\
The next pitch is really cool.  It starts up some fun and not too hard cracks, before squeezing through an improbable chock stone.  The squeeze through the chockstone is surprisingly tight and it makes you wonder if it has ever diverted or forced retreat on any climbers.  \
\
Jake about to squeeze through the chockstone:\
[img:3jhxwo57]http&#58;//staff&#46;washington&#46;edu/~killgoj/Prussik%20S%20Face/sahale%20038&#46;jpg[/img:3jhxwo57]belay \
\
From my belay above the chockstone I had ample time to stare at the notorious flared chimney above.  However just to kill some more time, I headed up the easy ground left of the chimney.  After a semi committing move, I realized that gaining the offwidth would involve a sketchy face traverse, so again I lowered off to the belay (3 nuts total left on this route).  Starting up the correct crack directly below the offwidth were some really fun and technical 5.8 moves.  The offwidth itself was definitely a thrutch.  One of the more physical affairs I’ve encountered climbing.  I climbed facing into the corner, which provided ample protection opportunities, but fairly insecure climbing.  I really didn’t want to take a cheese grater down the chimney, so I took advantage of all the placements I could.  Rests were easy, but painful, whereas moving up was really difficult.  I combination of knee barring, smearing, had jamming and other shenanigans eventually got me to the end of the flare, but I wasn’t sure how to exit.  Luckily, my ass happened to rub against a positive hold behind me.  I wiggled myself around and exited the chimney, relieved to have that pitch completed, but excited to have led it cleanly.  I set my belay at the far end of the ledge so we would have to move the belay for the final pitch.  When Jake reached the chimney, he found himself stuck and decided it would be faster if he prusiked the line instead of trying to follow or French.\
\
By this time, the sun was starting to set, making for some beautiful views:\
\
[img:3jhxwo57]http&#58;//staff&#46;washington&#46;edu/~killgoj/Prussik%20S%20Face/sahale%20040&#46;jpg[/img:3jhxwo57]\
\
At the base of the beautiful final pitch, I donned my headlamp and headed up.  The climbing was great, but the darkness (and fear induced by it) and fatigue were finally starting to set in.  This pitch has cracks of every size with some well placed knobs providing partial rests.  Near the top of the pitch, the cracks thin down and the foot holds get smaller.  Not wanting to take a fall, I ended up hanging to rest.  The rest of the pitch follows a very steep hand crack until an exit can be made right onto the summit block.  Jake followed entirely by headlamp and soon we were both on top.\
\

\
The descent by dark went pretty slow.  Jake didn’t recognize the summit rap anchor, but maybe it was just the light.  We were super careful with tossing the ropes, doing everything we could to prevent a stuck rope.  Nelson calls for 3-4 single rope raps (although he also says 4-8 hrs car to summit), but we ended up doing 6 or 7, of which only one was particularly short.  On the very last rap, the rope got stuck, so Jake climbed up and freed it.  Finally we were on our way out via the straightforward 3rd class trail.  The only caveat was that we didn’t bring shoes with us.  Seems that jake’s shoes are comfier than mine, or he has a higher tolerance for pain, but after reaching the base of the west ridge, I could barely walk.  I ended up barefooting it the rest of the way to our packs.  Our last goal for the night was to find a decent camp with some water.  After some wandering to the east we found a decent place and settled down.\

"Forbidden-peak","Forbidden Peak - East Ledges: 8/27/2006","[b:36i7sgxb]Synopsis:[/b:36i7sgxb] I soloed Forbidden Peak via the northeast ledges route, ascending in 2 hours and 30 minutes from the car. The round trip was just under 6 hours including a 45 minute break on the summit. The descent was actually a little slower than the ascent due to careful downclimbing and plenty of photography. Thanks to some great beta I didn’t bring an axe or crampons because the route is basically snow-free.   \

\
I set out from the car at 8:40 am after a smooth drive and reached Boston Basin in 45 minutes. \

\
I continued up to the upper Basin and ascended slabs and then the gully toward the solitary gendarme at the base of the East Ridge. I was trying to move fast, but when I saw several Ptarmigans just below the gendarme, I stopped for a photography session. \

\
I got some sweet shots and then made it to the gendarme about 2 hours into the climb. From here, I did the traverse over the ledges, but started ascending a little too soon costing me a few minutes when I had to continue the traverse higher up. The climb still went smoothly and I reached the summit at 11:10 am.  \

\
There were surprisingly few climbers on Forbidden. I heard a couple climbers on the West Ridge route as I was ascending upper Boston Basin in the morning, but they reached the summit after I had departed. Another pair of climbers was finishing the North Ridge route as I was topping out on the summit. \

\
As a result of onshore flow, the wall of smoke from the numerous wildfires stayed well to the east resulting in some excellent clarity, especially for the end of August. This was actually the first time I could clearly see Rainier from the North Cascades since mid-July. I enjoyed the gorgeous weather and views until just before noon.   \

We chatted for awhile and then as they rappelled, I downclimbed the Northeast face. My downclimbing was actually faster, especially after the first rappel length. \

"Guye-peak","Im-probably off-route on Guye","Monday Stephanie and I decided Guye Peak would be a fun, at least easily accesible, alpine adventure.  We thought it was sort of silly to climb seven pitches, several of them acrossy instead of uppy when we could do four pitches, all of them uppy.  In other words, we decided to do the Improbable Traverse direct variation on the 5.8 crack.  \
\
The AM 'shwack was heinous for about 50 ft until we reached the talus/scree slog.  We scrambled some 4th class unroped until we realized we had already climbed the first pitch.  At the belay for the second pitch (our first roped pitch) Stephanie revealed that she would be practicing her munter belay technique.  I led out a long (175 ft) and fun pitch with some cracks and whatnot to a belay on a big ledge.  \
\
Steph started to lead the traverse section and up the next pitch when we realized that some how we had already done the first three pitches and were at lunch ledge.  This meant it was time to take our 5.8 crack instead of the traverse.  She decided to leave the fun of the crack to me so she set up a belay and I followed the traverse and led up into the crack.\
\
The crack was protected with a piton and a falling out piton.  I placed a cam (#1 maybe) and was already pumped before even getting into it.  I thrashed my way up the dirty, sustained crack in what was probably the scariest lead of my life and the crack thrashed me in return.  Due to the lack of feet and sustained nature of the beast I couldn't get another piece until I pulled over the top; about 20 feet later.  I could hardly get up the low fifth class section above the crack to get to the belay because I was so pumped.  I found a hanging belay with 2 fixed nuts and backed it up with 2 TCUs.  Stephanie was pretty wasted after following, too, but luckily she had the energy to lead the next little stretch after the belay.  I don't know I would have had the juice and swapping the achor would have sucked.\
\
I followed the short pitch up to a ledge where Stephanie was belaying and led another short, but airy ledge system that put us out on a 4th class ramp.  We walked off the ramp, ditched the climbing shoes and followed a climber's trail for a bit.  The climber's trail got exposed and whatnot (4th or low 5th class) so I led one last roped pitch that put us in some much needed shade just below the summit.  So much for climbing fewer pitches!\
\
We were so exhausted and dehydrated we just wanted to get off the mountain, which proved to be almost epic in its own right.  We recruited the eyes of some hikers to help us spot the alleged walk-off over two false summits and back to a trail.  We sipped the dregs of our water (2 liters for the entire day for 2 people) and had a semi-miserable hike out.  Near the trailhead, we caught up with some hikers and negotiated a ride back to the car.  Cheers to their mountain karma.\
\
It was fun, more or less, but there was some stouter than expected cranking involved and we needed more water.  We were eating blueberries on the hike out for their liquid deliciousness.  There was some loose rock in places and the crack was wicked dirty.  Be prepared for some epicness on this climb, despite its modest rating of III, 5.8  Oh yeah, there's lots of traversing even if you don't do the traverse proper.  Welp, good times in the alpine. <!-- s:D --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\"" alt=\"":D\"" title=\""Very Happy\"" /><!-- s:D -->"
"Sloan-peak","Sloan Peak, West Ridge, 8/27/2006","J. Stern and I climbed the West Ridge of Sloan Peak last Sunday.  After reading a couple recent TRs, I wanted to go see what the fuss was about.  The route we climbed was disappointing in some ways, but it was a fun adventure.  ([url=http&#58;//www&#46;flickr&#46;com/photos/ralphbod/sets/72157594258527664:2u5toxo5]Clicky for photos.[/url:2u5toxo5])\
\
The trail was a cruise.  Cool in the morning, soft tread much of the way, easy to follow.  Beckey either never did the approach himself, is lying, or the trail has changed a lot since his green guide was published.  \""Allow five hours,\"" ha!  The West Face soon appears:\

\
Leaving the trees for the second time, you reach a beautiful little meadow with a huge boulder at the south end:\
\

\
The base of the West Ridge looked so close.  There was a good bit of scrambing to get there, though.  We took the second gully away from the face, which offered mostly solid, greasy rock, then a licheny granite-like substance on a rib to the right.\
\
Looking up at the ridge above, I was optimistic.  There was a long, whitish dihedral a ways up there that looked promising, and from there we could follow the ridge crest, bending left as we went.  We roped up and simulclimbed, expecting some rock, but mostly found heather.  Having placed no gear yet, we reached a ledge below the dihedral.\
\
Finally, here was a steep move on rock.  I pulled up into a groove and gingerly approached the corner.  OK, a bit of looseness here, but no big deal.  I placed a tricam, gave it a tug, and felt the bottom two feet of the corner grind together like old teeth.  Ugh.  Maybe there's better gear higher.  I started up, but got a bad feeling and downclimbed.  Moving left onto the face, I kicked down a brick of choss, but the overhang at the start kept it from bouncing at Josh.  A few more suspect holds and one nut got me to a slung block for a belay.  So much for the nice-looking dihedral.\
\
Here's Josh reaching the belay:\
\

\
From there, Josh led up and poked around for a while before belaying at the start of yet another heather bench.\
\
[img:2u5toxo5]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/61/228641152_d3315060aa&#46;jpg[/img:2u5toxo5]\
\
The ledginess was getting annoying.  I hustled up the gravel to a ledge overlooking the SW Face, avoiding the wide gully that opened up to our left (where Ted and Jesse went, perhaps?).  I really wanted to stick closer to the ridge crest, so led right around the corner, left on face holds, and back right to a white alcove at the base of an eight-foot hand crack.  Lichen, dirt, three pieces of gear, and some loose rock, but an improvement.  \
\
Josh got to lead the only real crack climbing of the route next and his belay was actually on the ridge crest.  Nice.  One more fun pitch, on dirty knobs and blocks, got us to the start of more scrambling.  We dragged the rope up until we reached the Corkscrew Route's trail, dropped gear, put on approach shoes, and meandered to the summit.\
\
There had been another car at the trailhead, but we hadn't seen anyone all day.  We took a good break at the summit and started down.  Josh was low on water, but we thought we'd reach a source in short order.  The descent was fairly easy to find.  Just as the trail makes a long traverse above the pocket glacier on the SE side, scramble down on heather to a shelf and keep going left.\
\
At some point here, the bite valve popped off Josh's Platypus and he lost his last liter.  Funny, because I had found a chewed up Platypus bite valve earlier in the day.  Josh was not happy, but he spied a stream running over a rock in the snow below us.  We rapped a full 30m to the moat on a clever red/gold sling anchor, filled up my water bag, and kept going.\
\
We stayed high below the SW face, for some reason that escapes me now, and found ourselves above a dirty gully, downridge from the one we had ascended that morning.  It didn't look so bad, with soft dirt to plunge down and a few rocks for handrails.  A couple hundred feet down, it steepened, so I moved right to a rib.  Here I kicked down a massive block, which turned into a cluster bomb that obliterated the gully below.  Yeah!\
\
Our descent options looked less and less appealing, but we continued down, scrambling down the rib, through some trees, and finally Tarzan-style down tree limbs until it cliffed out.  One rap off a stout tree got us to steep veggies near the base of the approach gully.  Josh was hurtin' from the heat and rigors of the descent, so he was pleased to suckle from the water teat for a long while in the shade:\
\
[img:2u5toxo5]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/64/228647597_878866be9a&#46;jpg[/img:2u5toxo5]\
\
We made it back to the car on our remaining water, debating the post-climb food options as we went.  There weren't many good ones on a Sunday night.  We had chips and vital fluids at the always-popular Darrington Shell station, but that wasn't gonna cut it.  At the Smokey Point exit, we arrived two minutes past Taco Time.  I would have eaten a soda cup full of beans at that point, but no, the manager had already put the food away.  Even raging hunger couldn't bring me to eat at Mickey D's, where Josh's only vegetarian option was the fries, so we pressed on to Everett and settled for Taco Bell.\
\
A good half-day (12.5h RT) in the mountains, even if the ratio of heather/choss to rock was too high.  The NW Buttress route looks pretty cool, with solid-looking granite, and there are definitely a few steep cracks on the SW Face waiting to be climbed."
,"Exit 32 - Brian Polagye entering the roped world!","Brian, Jen and I headed to Exit 32 yesterday for some cragging.  Everyone who knows Brian, knows that he throws down hard at Stone Gardens (bouldering Vhard and sending the roped routes in style), but also know that his escapades in the Cascades are always ropeless (though I did see a rope in one of the photos of the P. Traverse this summer).  \
\
His title on the board says it all: \""experienced hiker\"".  I've never met an experienced hiker who climbs so hard!  \
\
It's always seemed like a contradiction to me that he's always scrambling peaks in the most remote areas and climbing so hard at the gym, but avoiding the classic climbs of the cascades.  So when he called me up late Tuesday night to see if I wanted to join him and Jen, I jumped at the opportunity.  It turns out this was Brian's first time on rock in three years!  \
\
We started at Blackstone for a warm up.  I thought I picked the 5.9 there, but after I got near the top crux of the climb, it turns out I had actually jumped on one of the 10c's - didn't feel much harder than 10a, maybe 10b though.    \
\
Jen took a nice trad lead on one of the routes in Repo land, then I tore up Mambo Jumbo.  Jen and I watched in horror as Brian attempted to follow - MJ being his first crack climb!  But he send he did, after much cursing and by the time he topped out, he'd already acquired some impressive crack technique!  \
\
We climbed an array of sport climbs after this: Goddess, Situation Room, Reptiles, and the Jug or Not.  \
\
By the end of the day, Brian had already figured out what he needed to get all pimped out for cragging.  My intuition tells me that Brian is going to start working the cracks like he works the boulder problems, so keep an eye out for him at Index and Leavenworth!\
\
(Really wish I had a video of him on Mambo Jumbo!)"

\
Mark Swanson, Lara Thompson, and myself climbed on and around some fun craggy spires on the east ridge of Forbidden peak.

We did some problem-solving and tried to acquire a harness from every possible local source: climbers in the parking lot, a guy Ben knows in Monroe, both closed-down gear shops in the Sky valley.  Eventually, we drove back to Seattle, Ben got his harness, and we went to 38.\

,"Bushwhack to the Sultan River Upper Basin, Florence Rae mine","This is a trip report for a bushwhack from the Greider Lakes trailhead, up along the Sultan river to the Upper Basin and the Florence Rae mine.\
\
After spending an hour trying to carefully negotiate my motorcycle along 13 miles worth of gravel road, I arrived at the Greider Lakes trailhead, and by 10:00 I headed down the abandoned Elk Creek Road.  There is a recently abandoned ATV trail that one can follow, but for added adventure I chose to follow along the abandoned road, and use both the road and the Sultan River to gain access to the mine (at least that was the plan).\
\
After about a mile of plowing through heavy brush and Devil's club (a plant I've never encountered before on the east coast), I finally decided that the river would be much faster, so I cut through and started following the river where Elk Creek meets the Sultan River.\
\
Progress was much faster following the river (which conveniently never got any deeper than waist deep).  There were also some pretty impressive log jams across the river, leaving to the imagination what the river must look like in the spring. Yikes!\
\
After about 2 miles of following the river, I was attacked by a swarm of horse flies, and frantically dashed through a patch of Devil's club to hook back up with the abandoned road.  I was relieved to find that the regular ATV traffic had left the road a little brushy but still very passable.  While following the road, I came across some interesting relics, including a wide array of collapsed wooden bridges and an old watershed sign at about 3 miles.\
\
At 6 miles, I came to the Upper Basin picnic area which still had an intact outhouse and information booth.\
\
After passing the picnic area, I joined back up with the Sultan River, and followed it up into the Upper Basin (there is also a old mining road, but again I figured the river would be more fun).  After about a mile of wading, I ended up about 500 feet below the Florence Rae mine.  I then plowed through very thick brush, where I managed to almost almost lose my explorist 600 (and spend a panicked half-hour searching through thick brush before miraculously finding it).  I also managed to firmly grab onto a stinging nettle plant (which I've also never encountered on the east coast).  \
\
I finally emerged in the mine's dump, where I then spent the next 2 hours searching for a geocache that was hidden within the debris (the metal was confusing my compass and the cliffs were obscuring the GPS signal making the find very difficult). \
\
After finding the cache and exchanging trinkets, I had 2 hours before I needed to be back at the trailhead, so I could drive out of the dirt road while it was still light out.  I basically ended up power-walking the whole way back, and was able to clear 6.7 miles in under two hours.  On the way back, I opted to wade through a beaver pond that I had wasted a good hour plowing through Devil's club trying to portage around.  Much to my surprise, and aggravation, the pond turnout to be only ankle deep, and I got across in no more than 45 seconds.  Oh well, live and learn.\
\
Through my own stupidity and stubborness, I'd also managed to the entire hike in shorts and boots with no socks.  Needless to say, my legs and ankles got pretty tore up, although nothing more than just superficial scratches (except some sores on the front of my ankles where thick underbrush got caught and sawed away with each step).\
\
All in all, the hike makes for a great adventure, and allows one to really refine their bushwhacking, wading and navigational skills.  I would stronlgy suggest this hike to any newbie to the Cascades (such as myself).\

"Snowfield-peak","Snowfield Peak","Short version:

Four of us took the long weekend to attempt Snowfield peak, and possibly try and bag a couple of others in the area while we were out there.  In the end, slow travel for three of us on snowshoes lead to us only giving Snowfield a go, and saw three of the party high on the mountain, with one moving on to the summit.

Long version:

Kyle and I had decided to head out to the north cascades to try Snowfield Peak.  This would be Kyle's third attempt, and my first time in the area.  Late on Friday we had two additions, with Zoe and Ian bagging their trip to Olympus, and coming with us instead.  We met at 5am on Sat, loaded gear into my car, and were off.  Hit the ranger station in Marblemount at 7:30 where the hoards were already assembling for permits.  No blue bags, they ran out.  No problem getting our permit, and we were off to the trail head.  Only one car there, loaded up, and we were off.

Trail up to Pyramid Lake, is nice, and easy to follow, and we were quickly there.  Peak a boo views of Pyramid peak spured us on.

From the lake there is a climber's trail, which was pretty easy to follow, with a couple of exceptions, getting more difficult once we hit more snow.  As we climbed toward the ridge we heard voices behind us, and were caught buy another group of 4 skiers, including Mike Schmidt, who was back for his third attempt on Snowfield.  We gained the ridge, and donned snowshoes, the first of many off and ons we would do with them for the rest of the trip.  We worked our way up the ridge, avoiding a number of steep or cliffy sections on climbers right, which mostly required removing snowshoes for steep traversing.  Views up to Colonial Peak were stunning.

What was also stunning was the avy slope we had to cross to gain the toe of the Colonial Glacier.  It was scoured most of the way across with some of the avys having flowed deep into the basin.  It also appeared to have cut across an older set of skin tracks heading that way.  I was not thrilled.  It was afternoon, and we were tired from wallowing through deep wet snow.  We decided to make camp on a flatish spot semi proctected from the wind, and get up early the next morning to cross the frozen avy path.

We ate, set our alarms for 3am, and planned on getting moving at 4.  Things firmed up overnight, but not enough to keep us from postholing.  We wallowed across a steep section, and then finally were able to re-gain the ridge, and start using snowshoes.  We crunched past Mike's group, which was camped closer to the crossing, aparently having given up on their attempt (they had planned only 2 days, hoping to get to the colonial-neve col on the first day).

We started crossing the avy slope, which also saw us postholing, it was too steep to use snowshoes.  It took nearly 1.5 hours to cross the slope.  Once at the glacier toe, we dropped our overnight gear, and headed up the Colonial Glacier.

The glaciers are completely filled and firm in the morning, we snowshoed across without roping up.  In 45 min we reached the Colonial-Neve Col.  We were treated to amazing views in both directions including Snowfield, our destination.  At this point I sucumbed to sleep deprivation, a bleeding hand, and general lazyness and decided to stay at the col while the others pushed on.  The next 5 hours of the trip are in my eyes only, others will have to fill in route details.  I watched them drop to the Neve glacier, and cross to the base of Snowfield.  I took lots of pictures

Paul B's Stump, Pinacle Peak, and Pyramid Peak
After about 2 hours I lost site of them as the moved off snow onto the ridge on Snowfield.  I dried gear, ate candy, took pictures, and re-hydraded (running water!).  A couple hours later I once again saw dots moving on Snowfield.  One moved down directly over the steeper section of the Neve.  I knew it must be Ian, getting ready to ski down.  I grabbed my camera, and excitedly watched him drop in, carving beautiful S turns down the face.  I was on a sugar high, and this was definatly one of the coolest moments I've ever had in the mountains.

Ian shreding!
30 min later everyone was back at the col.  A 5th class section had stymied Zoe and Kyle about 150ft below the summit.  Ian had soloed it, and tagged the top.  Ian droped into one of the steep snowfingers just down from the top.  Everyone ate, and got more water, then we dropped back onto the Colonial Glacier, and returned to our dropped gear.  I got a nice 500+ft glissade in.  We grabed our gear, found a nice camp site, and set up for the night.  Again we got up early (moving by 4:30am) to cross the avy slope.  I thought it would go quicker, but it still took us an hour to cross even with most of our feet pre kicked in.  One section was interesting, as our boot marks were gone  <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\"" alt=\"":shock:\"" title=\""Shocked\"" /><!-- s:shock: --> and it was quite icy.  Zoe was working on kicking steps and a few tiny ice balls started trickling down the runnels.  Fun.  We made it across safely, and were met with breakable crust on the other side.  Some places I was sinking to my knees with snowshoes on.  This began another set of &quot;snowshoes-off, snowshoes-on&quot;  until we refound our up-track, and decended into the trees.  We slogged back to the lake, and then the trail back to the car, where we emerged tired and dehydrated.  A quick change of clothes and we were on our way back to seattle.  A large chocolate milkshake, and a large soda powered me through the drive.  Getting back we found some jackass had ripped off one of Ians rims  <!-- s:evil: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_evil.gif\"" alt=\"":evil:\"" title=\""Evil or Very Mad\"" /><!-- s:evil: --> Won't park there again.

Others can fill in the gaps, and I think Ian took some more pics.  I'll go back some day, but either with skis, or later in the season, when the approach is more straight forward."
,"Alpine high camp above Gouda Creek 9/2-9/5","Labor Day weekend found Kevin Steffa, Jon Jantz, Yoav Bar-Ness and I basking in sedgey flats, grazing in blueberry meadows, and exploring the polished slabs of the Southern Pickets.  In the process we went up West McMillian Spire, traversed parts of the McMillian-Elephant ridge, had some snowball fights and acquainted ourselves with our furry neighbors.\
\
We rendezvoused at Gouda Creek (aka Goodell Creek) on Saturday morning, where some of us decided to try key lime yogurt spa treatments.  Once along the high traverse of heather benches we took a few naps in the grassy flats that offered good views and shady rocks.  Eventually, we headed down to the hanging valley of Terror Basin and made our camp near a reflective tarn.  The vantage point was ideal for the three photographers of the group, who managed to plow through memory cards last weekend like they were going out of style.\
\
On Sunday morning we woke to haze from the forest fires masking the valley and views of Triumph and Despair.  On route to the top of the day’s objective, Jon encountered an adorable (and for a few days misidentified furry friend).  Despite the smoke, the top of McMillian offered a commanding vantage point for looking over to the Northern Pickets and the ever-rising mushroom cloud of forest fire smoke.  Kevin traversed back to camp along the high ledges below little Mc while Jon, Yoav and I went back via the way of a ptarmigan tarn.  The photo shoot continued long after the sun had set behind the Chopping Block.  Kevin and Jon, in tune with the weather set up the Betamid that evening and had space in it waiting for one more guest when the rains fell in the dark hours of the morning.  (Thanks guys.)\
\
A loungey start to Monday eventually transitioned into a traverse along the ledges and polished slabs NE of camp over to the ridge that joins McMillian to Elephant Butte.  Kevin and Yoav found forests of quartz crystals in the red rock leading up to the notch between M and EB. The junction above the notch is a trifecta of three drainages:  Goodell, Stettattle, and McMillian. Kevin and I explored a ways along the ridge as a bit of recon for the EB traverse.  The short section we covered included some fourth class sections and a few exposed areas.  For those who’d like to do the whole traverse it wouldn’t be a bad thing to carry a rope to rappel through a few less choice sections of the ridge.  After a snowball fight, inspection of the glacier on the north side of McMillian and an hour of good cloud watching we eventually all roamed back to camp.  \
\
Sorry to have to leave our high camp or the excellent views of the Pickets, we eventually packed up on Tuesday morning and made our way back down to Gouda Creek.  Along the way we grazed on alpine blueberries and in our favorite sedgy flat we picnicked on concoctions of Nutella and wasabi cashews and the last vestiges of our creek’s cheesy namesake.\
\
Good times had by all.  I predict the photos will be coming soon."
,"Whipper of the year!","So, Eric and I attempted the Boving Route on Dragontail today...\
\
While leading the first pitch, Eric got a little bit off route, got a little bit run out, got some not-so-awesome gear in, and got spat off of some hardness...\
\
Chronological thoughts while belaying (me):\
1. Woah, is he falling!?\
2. Oop, yeah, that's airborn!\
3. Oh, shit, his piece pulled!\
4. Oh, shit, another piece pulled!\
5. Oh, shit, another piece pulled!!\
6. Holy shit, he's gonna deck!\
\
Well, he didn't deck.  He came to a rest about 15 feet above my ledge, with only a few bruises and scrapes.  Three pieces pulled, for a total of about 60-70 feet of falling...  A yellow TCU caught Cpt. Insano.\
\
Well, evidently I was more shaken up than Eric, because he said, \""I think we can keep going, although I might not do my share of leads...\""  I opted for retreat, which I think was in the end a wise decision.  No doubt Eric is probably gonna wake up pretty sore tomorrow!\
\
Anyways, please refrain from turning this into a safety debate.  There is obviously a thin line between pushing yourself and being reckless, that everyone has to feel out for themselves.\
\
Instead, let's just celebrate a safe landing!  Eric gets UWCC Whipper of the Year if you ask me!\
\
I've got some photos showing Cpt. Insano's flight, but I don't know how to get them up here."
,"Nice","Nice, I had a good time on Sloan when I did it - not because it was hard or stellar climbing, but simply because the last time I was in there climbing it seemed so intimidating and this time it was dare-i-say routine. The trail has been improved dramatically in the last two years....it used to take at least 3 hours to get in there for sure!"
"Ruth-mountain","Mt. Ruth","Daniel Arndt came to town and wanted to get to the mountains away from crowds, telepheriques, and huts.

Luckily, Daniel's sneakers fit, and the trip was salvaged.\

,"Bushwhacking along Red Mountain","I'd been itching to get out in the woods all week, so Saturday I decided to explore Red Mtn. in the Sultan River Basin to see if I could find any good ascent routes.\
\
I trekked out from the Boulder Creek Trailhead around 10:00AM, and followed along the road, past the barrier.  Despite being abandoned, the route was very clear, and there was even a worn footpath (I wonder who could be using this?).  I continued along the road until I found a good entry point into the woods up a steep land slide.  I then continued to climb until I was about 100' below the cloud base (no need to complicate things by bushwhacking in fog), and then traversed along the ridge to scout out routes.\
\
For the most part, the ridge was difficult traversing, where what was once oldgrowth forest (as suggested by the massive stumps I frequently passed, very depressing) is now raspberry bushes and hemlocks.  Occasionally, I would bump into bits of logging road that would allow for easier travel, but they were no longer than about 150' per stretch.  \
\
After plowing through thick brush and scrambling over wet, slippery logging debris, I came across a swath of fallen timer that was about 500' across.  Traversing this was fairly technical, since the trees were very wet and therefore completely frictionless.  I ended up putting my ice axe to good use by planting it into the tree, and then using it as a pivot to haul my body over.  This technique was very effective, but a little nerve-wracking, with images of the pick giving way, and my sliding down the full 80' length of the tree to untold injuries below.\
\
After this fun/challenging section, I was rewarded with open old growth forest, which I followed over to a creek I found on a topo map (the creek isn't shown, but the topo lines make its existence very clear).  I then opted to use the creek to descend back down towards the road.  However, what was mere gravel towards the top gave way to vertical falls with steep carved-out walls on either side.  Eventually, I was forced to bail from the falls, and used the woods to finish my descent.  However, the woods were equally challenging, because where there were falls in the creek there were ledges in the woods.  \
\
When I finally came out onto the road, the fun was over and I followed the road to the parking lot.\
\
Oh, and a quick note, has anyone else had their camera flash cause a cloud of vapor to spontaneously form?  A few times when I shot a picture with the flash, I would hear a *pop* and a vapor cloud would instantly form in front of the camera.  I couldn't help but wonder if the air was so saturated with moisture that the energy of the flash was enough to trigger condensation.  Pretty cool!\

,"Goldbar Bouldering","On Sunday, Justin T and I went to Goldbar, hoping the rain wouldn't follow us.  As it turned out, we had a great day of good climbing and not a drop of rain until we were talking back to the car.  Unfortunately (like most of my climbing this summer), we had no camera and I don't know the area well enough to say which problems we did.  I do know that we started on the Obelisk (V0 slab) and then moved over to a v2 and v3 that were both short but sweet.  Justin was not impressed with my beta-spraying, \""just put your heel where your right hand is and lock off on the small crimp with your left...\"".  I then spotted a boulder with an interesting nose-like feature protruding out about halfway up the boulder, so we scrubbed it down and I sent it on my second go.  I'm fairly sure no one had been on it before so I'm gonna nab the FA (side thought: it seems weird to me that the same phrase can be used for a short boulder problem and a multi-day alpine rock climb).  I called it \""Jer-Bear's Hug\"" because of the double heel-hooks I threw in while hugging the nose feature, I htink it's about a V2 but Justin thought it was a touch harder because of the difficult mantle on top of the nose.  We then hiked a round and did a few more really fun V1-3s and played on \""Stinkin' Slopers\"" (V5) which spit both of us off time and time again.\
Overall a great day!"
"Glacier-peak","Glacier Peak (attempt) - 5/23 - 5/26","Over an extended Memorial Day weekend, Charles, Obadiah, Jim, and I set out to climb Glacier Peak from the east. This was an amazingly wild route in which we didn't see a soul from one trailhead Friday evening until we popped out at another on Tuesday afternoon. While we didn't make it all the way to the top of Glacier, it was a great trip with great people. While not technically difficult, the route was quite committing since there were any number of possible impasses which could have required significant backtracking.

[b:16zo373x]Day 0[/b:16zo373x]: [i:16zo373x]Seattle to Chiwawa River Road (MP 19)[/i:16zo373x]
Normally, a good trip starts once you've loaded up your pack and set foot on the trail. This one had all the signs of an epic starting with the drive. Monroe to Sultan took nearly two hours of crawling along in heavy traffic that reminds me of the worst traffic I've ever sat in coming down from Stevens. Perhaps 1700 on Memorial Day isn't the best time to leave Seattle? We dropped my car off at the White River Trailhead (now a completely snow free drive) and drove Jim's to the gate at Mile 11 on Chiwawa River Road. Along the way, Jim found his clutch going softer and softer, until it took Obadiah using two hands to shift the car with the clutch fully depressed. After staggering through a three point turn involving 1st and rolling back in neutral, we ate some food, drank some beer, shouldered packs, and hoped the car would fix itself while we were gone. Around the gate and headed up the road at a steady pace at 2300. 

I can't say I recommend walking Chiwawa River Road, but if you're going to do it, walking it in the dark and swapping stories ain't a bad way to go. Some odd sights along the way: snowed in campgrounds, a truck parked a mile up from the gate (?), and some people having a campfire about 5 miles up the road. Patchy snow started about 4 miles up the road, deepening as we continued. In places where the snow has melted, the road bed is still quite soft and I can see it being another week or two before the rangers open the gate. Set up camp in the middle of the road at 0100 just beyond the major creek crossing past Nineteenmile Campground.

Road Camp - Obadiah had by far the lightest pack, but also spent the most time shivering.

[b:16zo373x]Day 1[/b:16zo373x]: [i:16zo373x]Chiwawa River Road (MP 19) to Triad Creek[/i:16zo373x]

Up and moving after 6 short hours of rest, we hoofed it the rest of the way in to Trinity, took our last civilized &quot;deuce&quot; at the facilities, and headed up the Buck Creek trail at 1030. Most of the trail was under at least of bit of snow, but we were able to follow the general route for much of the morning, finally loosing the route around 4000'.

Three staggeringly large and destructive avalanches cross the Buck Creek trail. One appears to have taken out a large stand of mature timber, so once the snow melts, it's going to take a trail crew to facilitate passage to Buck Creek Pass. Around 4500' we finally caved in and put on snowshoes, which reduced the tendency to posthole, but did increase the tendency to slide down icy slopes. Because of the deep snow, we were able to shortcut the annoying switchback on the trail by crossing Buck Creek on a snowbridge of questionable strength and heading straight uphill towards Helmet Butte. By this time in the day, the snow had turned to gloopy mess and the 800' of uphill was an exercise in patience. Around 1800 we reached Buck Creek Pass and got our first view of Glacier Peak. Very snowy and still very far away.

After taking a break to eat and rest our aching feet, we set off down the west side of the pass, first on open slopes and then in to timber. We ended up consulting the maps and GPS quite often to keep on route, since the natural curvature of the land does not want to take you towards Triad Creek. Around 4500' the snow started to peter out and Obadiah managed to locate and keep us on the tread from the abandoned Triad Creek Trail (#792). This turned out to be a critical find as the trail (still in excellent shape except for some annoying blowdowns) navigates some very steep terrain in fine fashion. Around 3700', we crossed Triad Creek on a rotten old growth log that I expect is all that remains of the stringer from the trail bridge. A steep climb out of the Triad Creek drainage put us on a plateau over the Suiattle River and our camp site for the night around 2100. To say it had been a long day would be a vast understatement. 24 hour mileage: ~24 miles, much of it on snow.

[b:16zo373x]Day 2[/b:16zo373x]: [i:16zo373x]Triad Creek to 7200' on northern margin of Chocolate Glacier[/i:16zo373x]
Up and moving by 0730, none of us felt entirely refreshed from the previous day (big surprise). Followed the Triad Creek trail about 50' above the Suiattle River drainage where a number of blowdowns had obliterated the trail. Picked our way down pretty easy slopes to the river bed. We had joked about felling a tree with our ice axes to cross the Suiattle, but this would require a tree over a thousand feet tall. The Suiattle River valley is a 1/4 mile wide swath of boulders and sand - the product of annual flooding and glacial melt.

Amazingly, we found a sturdy log right where we needed it to get across (the only feasible crossing for a 1/2 mile in either direction). Obadiah and I managed to engineer it in to a slightly more solid position and then we scooted across, current nipping at our boots.

On the far side, we headed too far up river and missed the branch of the trail coming down from Suiattle River trail and ended up down a bit of steep snow climbing to get into the flat, open timber on the divide between Chocolate and Dusty Creeks. Obadiah set a solid pace up through the forest and though the climb was gradual, it was far preferable to the endless level slog that had been the Buck Creek drainage. Around 6000' we popped out of the trees for the first time and were rewarded with amazing views of Gamma Peak and the mountains to the east (Fortress, Sitting Bull, Bonanza, Buck, Napeequa, etc.).

As we climbed in sloppy snow up towards 7000', Jim felt something settle underfoot and we stopped to dig a pit. Above 8&quot; down was a rapidly decomposing ice crust, now covered by relatively fresh snow from the storms last week. Concerned over the potential for slides (and having seen several large, crowning fractures on steeper aspects), we set up camp on a very pleasant plateau around 1600. The camp featured a large boulder for drying socks and soaking up the views, plenty of space for cooking, and amazing views over a 180 degree arc (the back of the arc being blocked by the equally amazing views of seracs from the bottom of the Chocolate Glacier). We spent the next few hours lazing about and listening to spontaneous rockfall off the side of Dusty Wedge into the Chocolate Creek drainage.

Our original plan had been to climb Frostbite Ridge by crossing the North Guardian Glacier to the Dusty Glacier and camping on a flat bit somewhere between 8000' and 8500'. Our concerns about snow stability, our lower camp, and the forecasted warming trend forced us to considerably alter the plan (which is what happens when you try to climb Glacier Peak at the end of May). Knowing that the sun on Monday would once again turn the slopes to unstable glop, we set our alarms of 0100 for a [i:16zo373x]really[/i:16zo373x] alpine start.

[b:16zo373x]Day 3[/b:16zo373x]: [i:16zo373x]7200 Camp to White River[/i:16zo373x]

Alpine starts, particularly those at 0100 are painful. Even for Charles, who'd been training for peak performance around 0000 by drinking heavily the weak before we'd left. We packed up camp and were underway in the dark by 0200. Overnight, the snow had refrozen, except where the cleavers were only a few feet down and the thermal mass had been enough to keep the snow isothermal. Fortunately, these episodes were infrequent and crampons ruled the early morning hours. We crossed the Chocolate Glacier and then seamlessly transitioned on to the Cool Glacier. As the sun began to paint the horizon, we reached the 9200' pass on the east side of Disappointment Peak, where our route met up with the standard route from Glacier Gap. The summit, 1200' up looked tantalizingly close, but worried that the crust would disintegrate in a few hours, we opted to head directly down the Gerdine Glacier to the Disappointment Cleaver. I've walked this particular bit of Glacier Peak a number of times over the years, but I'm always struck by the incredible views and aesthetics of the route. Much prettier than any other volcano I've ever been on. Particularly when your group of four are leaving the only tracks other than an errant goat.

Around 0630, we roped back up and started the painful traverse of the Suiattle Glacier towards the Koholo Peaks. Why painful you might ask? Consider that for the last 4+ hours, we'd been predominately sidehilling in the same direction on frozen snow. Our ankles were not exactly pleased, but they did carry us up to the top of the Suiattle Glacier where we rested in the sun and I scrambled a choss heap to the east of Pt. 8197. Next time I'm up that way, I'll have to bag the actual peak before the Koholo Range becomes my nemesis and I lose all my friends dragging them back there.

By 0930 when we started moving again, the snow had softened considerably and the contouring of the Honeycomb Glacier (number 5 for those of you keeping count) we a sloppy affair. As Beckey says, the terrain affords &quot;wide latitude&quot; (read: flat) and we contoured at about 7700' until we were looking down into the Lightening Creek drainage. The deep, wet snow led to some epic postholing, but by 1100 we were off the Glacier and heading down broad, snow covered slopes towards the White River.

Swapping crampons for snowshoes, we made great time, descending over 100'/minute at times and found ourselves at the junction of the forks of Lightening Creek (4200') less than an hour later. 

Heading down into Lightening Creek. Even with snowshoes we were sinking 6&quot; into heavy mashed potatoes.
[img:16zo373x]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/bpolagye/Glacier2/IMG_3286&#46;jpg[/img:16zo373x]

Crossing here on stones and deadfall, we worked our way down to a surprisingly exposed rib above lower Lightening Creek. The geography here is fascinating. The river has cut a gorge down into basalt columns quite similar to what one sees around Vantage, but not something I've ever seen around Glacier Peak. Though the ridge has been pummeled by avalanches, we were able to (astonishingly) locate some old tread for the final 200' - a remnant of the Lightening Creek High Route in [i:16zo373x]Rocks and Routes[/i:16zo373x]. Portions of the tread were buried by several seasons of pine cones, but we were able to follow it without too much trouble until things flattened out in the snowy, shaded bottom of the White River Valley. 

We crossed Lightening Creek right down by the White River where it braids into about five channels, then staggered back uphill and crashed out on some sun-warmed talus at the base of some basalt columns around 1500. Our packs basically exploded here as we worked to dry out all the gear that had been soaking up moisture for the past three days on the snow. A combination of napping and gaping brought us to dinner and a well-deserved rest.

[b:16zo373x]Day 4[/b:16zo373x]: [i:16zo373x]White River to Seattle[/i:16zo373x]
After 10 hours of sleep, we were all feeling much better in the morning and were ready to head home. After a bit of postholing in open forest, we were able to locate the White River trail, which allowed us to posthole in open forest on a trail. In places, where the trees opened up, the trail was melted out and we could see how things could be a bit of a brushy mess once things leaf out fully. 

Thunder Creek was thundering, but we were able to locate a stout log a few hundred feet downstream of the original crossing (wrecked puncheon bridge hangs about halfway across the river channel).

Once we reached the other side, it was smooth sailing for six miles back to the car, where cold beers and watermelon awaited us in a creek. (well, the watermelon was in the car, but it sounds cooler to find it in a creek).

Normally, trips end here, but ours still had a bit to go. Packing ourselves into my car, we drove back up Chiwawa River road to Jim's car. The road was still gated (much to our satisfaction) and we lounged around for a bit, sorting through gear and talking about what we'd just done. Then came time to start Jim's car. No clutch, no dice. With the car pointed uphill and no way to shift (except with the car turned off) we couldn't do a damn thing. In the end, Obadiah, Charles, and I pushed the car up to the top of a rise, then gave it a good shove downhill, and Jim was able to start it in gear, speeding off at 20 mph towards Cole's Corner. We followed in my car and managed to liberally interpret both stop signs on the road out. Parked the car about a mile from US 2, where AAA helpfully towed it back to the Seattle.

All around epic trip and a great time with a great group. Once I get my pictures sorted, I'll fortify the TR with them, but for now, it's time to get back to work.

Addendum:
One of the things we found ourselves talking about as we hiked out along the White River trail was how much the area aches of fallen splendor (in the same sense as Minas Tirith for Lord of the Rings aficionados). The Triad Creek trail was obviously constructed with great care and the tread remains in fantastic shape despite years of neglect. But it obviously doesn't see many boots and the bridge over Triad Creek has been reduced to two rotted and cracking stringers - one of which doesn't even cross the entire creek. The bit of the Upper Suiattle River Trail we walked along was in similarly good shape. The Lightning Creek High route was never a real trail, but we saw signs of old maintenance and some solid tread buried beneath a few seasons of pine cones. The White River trail between Thunder and Lightening Creeks passes through magnificent open forest, but the slopes between Lightening and Boulder Creek are slowly becoming choked by brush.

Organizations like WTA are great for maintaining the first couple miles of trails, but I really feel like something more needs to be done further from the roads to keep areas like this open for years to come as they have been in decades past. I just wish I knew a way to make that happen."
"snow-creek-wall","Snow Creek Wall, White Slabs, 9/18","Betsy and I had a date to go climbing and headed to Leavenworth.  We didn't get quite the early start we hoped for (this would not surprise those who know us <!-- s;) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\"" alt=\"";)\"" title=\""Wink\"" /><!-- s;) --> ) and started hiking at 10:30am.  Just across the creek, we ran into two climber-lookin' dudes.\
\
\""Hey, are you going up to Snow Creek?\""\
\
\""Yup, did you just come down from there?\""  They must have taken a quick run up Outer Space before the crowds arrived, I'm thinking.\
\
(To his partner:) \""Uh, I guess it's clearing up over there.\""\
\""We felt some rain and turned around.\""\
\
\""Oh.  It looks good now.\""  Everyone looks up at the sky.\
\
Awkward silence.  The two guys exchange glances.  Hesitation.\
\
\""OK, well, I'll just let you guys think that one over,\"" I say as I hustle on up the trail.\
\
Poor fellas.  I wonder what they ended up doing with their day.\
\
We arrived at the base of our route, with several parties crawling all over the wall to the left.  I thought White Slabs (5.7, 4p) would be a good intro to Snow Creek Wall for Betsy.  If she didn't mind the dirt, veggies, and unbolted belays, then I figured she might enjoy a future trip up one of the more technically difficult classics on the wall.  Better for her to ease back into it.\
\
The first pitch started with a totally optional 5.7 slab move and scrambled up to a one-cam belay below the technical climbing.  I was not impressed after the first pitch, but the second was not bad: a little hand crack, some stemming, cleaner rock.  The belay was a little awkward, with either a sketchy slung boulder or a tree for an anchor.\
\
[img:1dw19pon]http&#58;//static&#46;flickr&#46;com/97/248430170_458ef6c01a&#46;jpg?v=0[/img:1dw19pon]\
Betsy coming up pitch two.  Fun so far!\
\
The next pitch was a bit more challenging, with water-worn slippery spots, reachy moves, and mandatory stemming and jamming.  Betsy let out a few yells of frustration on her way up, but pulled through with determination.\
\
Pitch four led to the Country Club Ramp, which I thought we could traverse either down to the Umbrella Tree route or left to the top of the formation.  Betsy grunted up the final mantel and joined me at the tree belay, where we took a break and discussed options.  The Umbrella Tree looked out of reach and traversing up the Ramp was very dirty and unpleasantly unprotectable for a follower.\
\
So we rappelled, leaving a couple slings and a biner on the way down to back up the existing anchors, one of which was a single sling around an hourglass in the middle of a dihedral.\
\
We ran into several climbers on the way out who had seen us climbing and wondered what route we were on.  I'd say White Slabs is worth doing, with three full pitches of decent climbing, good pro, easy routefinding up an obvious set of corners, and certainly less of a line-up than the classics.  It's too bad that it ends at the Ramp, but a determined party could link up with Umbrella Tree or grovel up the Ramp to the top.\

White Slabs goes up right of the white slabs\
\
Betsy did great with the uncertainty and dirtiness that comes with a less-traveled route and even enjoyed herself.  Now that she's indulged my urge for more \""adventurous\"" climbing, I owe her some user-friendly cragging time... like when we move to Boulder next year and a hike to the crag means ten minutes out the front door <!-- s;) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif\"" alt=\"";)\"" title=\""Wink\"" /><!-- s;) -->"
,"Another adventure on Red Mtn...bushwhacking, waterfalls, etc","This weekend I had another hankering to go an play on Red Mtn. again in the Sultan Basin.  I decided to try my second route choice to crest the ridge...or at least that was my original intent.\
\
I loaded up my crotch rocket, and was at the Boulder Lake trailhead by 8:30, an on the trail by 9:00.  It was nice to be hiking in relatively dry conditions, compared to last weekend.\
\
When I arrived at the creek I explored last week, I hiked a little ways up the stream to get a quick photo of a fairly tall falls before proceeding on down the road.\
\
Further down the road, I got a great view of the summit of Red mountain, as well as the many other peaks that dot the ridge line.  \
\
It turned out that what I thought to be a gentle creek perfect for ascending the ridge (according to the topo map) was really a gorge with sheer cliffs on either side.  The left side appeared to be one giant cliff on the topo map, so I decided head up the right side.\
\
The bushwhack started out as just plowing through brush up a steep slope, but further up I began to encounter sizeable moss covered ledges that could not be circumnavigated.  The ice axe proved very useful in grabbing holds that were out of my reach, as well as cleaning off foot holds.  \
\
After a good challenge trying to find my way through the brush, I came out to a beautiful waterfall that was cascading off an over-hang into the gorge below.  I tried to continue up to the top of the falls, only to find that what I had been climbing was a wedge between two gorges.  Out of curiosity, I tossed a rotted hunk of wood off the side, and according to everyone's favortie kinematics equations:\
[img:1n04w26y]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/llamero/kinematics&#46;gif[/img:1n04w26y]\
I was able to estimate that the wood fell 100' - 144' before hitting bottom. \
\
Backing carefully away from what was likely a percarious over-hang, I figured this route was a dead-end and decided to head back down. \
\
Descending was a lot more fun (gravity is very helpful when trying to plow through thick brush), but also a lot more perilous. The ledges that I had climbed on the way up were completely invisible on the way back down.  Needless to say,  I managed to walk right off a few before even realizing they were there.  Eventually, I figured out how to use my ice axe as a belay anchor to abseil off the shorter ledges.  However this too was not entirely fool-proof, where I managed to come crashing back into the ledge on one of my more half-hearted attempts. \
\
After all sorts of hiking, rappelling, swimming and falling back down to the road, I headed back for the trailhead.\
\
On the way, I noticed an odd red spot on one of the cliffs.  I tried to get a picture of it, but it didn't come out real well.\
\
Anyway, this approach was a complete dead end, but even if it had worked, I could clearly see exposed class IV and possibly class V scrambles higher up on the ridge...no thank-you.  All in all, a really fun adventure, and I can't wait to come back an retry my first route (possibly my best bet for reaching the crest of the ridge).\

A route track of my second adventure on Red Mtn.  Not a very long bushwhack, but very technical."
"Chianti-spire","E. Face Chianti Spire","I climbed Rebel Yell with Josh Whorley yesterday.  We had perfect weather and the larches are starting to turn color, making for awesome surroundings.  This was both of our first times up to the wine spires, so we goofed of in the forest for a little before getting on the real trail and beginning the long hike up.  The steep trail reminded both of us that we are fat and in terrible shape, but we managed to make it to the col in what seemed like decent time.  Decending the col and hiking around the E side of Burgundy to get to Chianti was anotehr story.  Last week when we had bad weather here, it looks like it snowed up there and some of the snow is still there, lightly covering the hard glacier ice.  So, with tennis shoes, we kick stepped our way across the snow and finally made it to the base of the route.  We somehow managed to do the route in 4 long pitches instead of the 6 suggested in the Nelson guide.  Josh went from the base of the leaning cracks to the end of the rope just above the 5.9 wide stuff.  I then led up easy terrain and  pulled around the corner a little higher (I think) than where I was supposed to and set a belay just to the right of the .10a dihedral.  Josh jogged up that, but stopped just below the wide stuff because \""he wasn't sure he had the gear\""- even though he had the 3.5 with him and thats all he really would have needed.  I came up (that pitch didn't feel very hard at all) and took all of the gear, unsure of what the top of the route would look like (except I forgot the small cams and nuts which I sort of regretted later).  A bunch of grunting took me through the OW as I walked the 3.5 with me to the ledge about 20 ft up and then I decided to just go to the top.  Athough the climbing wasn't hard, it stayed wide, so I kept walking the cam and realized I didn't have much gear in except for the bolt anchor I clipped at the small ledge.  There was a small crack next to me, but since I left the nuts with Josh I didn't have much hope of getting a piece in (I slammed a totally cammed green alien in for psychological pro).  The only kicker to doing it this way was that the rope drag was horrendous near the top, but the summit views were great.  Josh came up and mentioned many times how happy he was to have not led that pitch.  3 double rope rappels put us back on the ground.  W packed up and made (I think) good time back to the car, but we were both bonking from lack of food and water, so we decided to forgo the victory beer until we got food in us.\
This is one of the best routes I've done and I hope to get back and do it again sometime."
"Del-campo-peak","Del Campo - Spectacular Fail","Lucas and I headed up to Gothic Basin Sunday morning to give a shot a Del Campo.  We left Seattle at 6am and were on the trial shortly after 7:30am.  It was absolutely frigid at Barlow Pass, which motivated us to move swiftly down the road to the Gothic Basin trailhead.  

[img:38t5enpv]http&#58;//lh4&#46;ggpht&#46;com/_cmsGJSU3p2s/Sso6qlTvCuI/AAAAAAAAEeo/0usNyGwIzHE/s720/DSC_2658e&#46;jpg[/img:38t5enpv]

It was a truly spectacular day, and all the peaks of the Monte Cristos were out in full force.  By 3000' we started finding small patches of snow, but soon the trial was mostly covered in a few inches.  We made into Gothic Basin before 10:30am and stopped for a quick food break by Foggy Lake while absorbing the warm sun on the rocks.  Soon we were on our way again and working our way up the ridge on to Del Campo.  Lucas got his first opportunity to experience early season snow covering boulder fields.  At one point he stepped into a sizable hole that shifted and trapped his boot.  After several minutes to trying to free himself, he had to unlace his shoe to free his foot.  I'm not sure how well received my comments were about using his foot as a cam.  By this point we were both starting to regret our decision to leave our gators at home as the snow about about one foot deep.  

[img:38t5enpv]http&#58;//lh5&#46;ggpht&#46;com/_cmsGJSU3p2s/Sso6nKrCT1I/AAAAAAAAEeI/Bj0UqKcNY3U/s720/DSC_2601e&#46;jpg[/img:38t5enpv]

We reached the base of the gully and started climbing the rock to the left of it.  The first section of climbing was pretty good 3rd class rock with moderate exposure.  While many parts of the route were covered with snow, most of the hand holds were clear, solid and little excavation was required.  After turning the corner at the notch we started up the 2nd section of 3rd/4th class rock, the exposure now was much greater, although I don't think that much effect on either of us (falling 100' vs. 500' the result is going to be about the same).

[img:38t5enpv]http&#58;//lh5&#46;ggpht&#46;com/_cmsGJSU3p2s/Sso6sAWSuYI/AAAAAAAAEe4/WW41JPuepQo/s720/DSC_2682e&#46;jpg[/img:38t5enpv]

As we made our way up the route the quality of the hand holds began to degrade and with them my confidence in down climbing the route.  About 1/3rd the way up I started to realize that I could climb the route, but I was beginning to seriously question my ability to down climb it.  So about 100'-150' from the summit I informed Lucas that I had reached the point where I needed to turn around and very slowly started to work my way back down.  Lucas briefly considered continuing on, but then reconsidered once he recognized the reason I was turning around.

[img:38t5enpv]http&#58;//lh5&#46;ggpht&#46;com/_cmsGJSU3p2s/Sso6nrDYoKI/AAAAAAAAEeM/27TcIMJeXHA/s720/DSC_2613e&#46;jpg[/img:38t5enpv]

We spent about an hour descending the route we had just come up.  Our foot prints in the fresh snow helped show the route we had used to ascend the route, but also provided added danger as the compressed snow had iced up and was now very slick.  I breathed a great sigh of relief once I was back down on the talus field, and again once Lucas also arrived.  

[img:38t5enpv]http&#58;//lh3&#46;ggpht&#46;com/_cmsGJSU3p2s/Sso6t5KtQbI/AAAAAAAAEfI/_HyIw2ieKs8/s576/DSC_2621e&#46;jpg[/img:38t5enpv]

Our nerves shot and energy greatly drained from the stressful down-climb, we decided to take an extended break on some large rocks further down the talus field.  Here we ate, drank, and filled our camera's memory cards with stunning views.  We briefly considered making an attempt on Gothic, but decided against.  Looking through Foggy pass we were able to make out the Olympics, Lake Washington and the downtown skyscrapers.  To the South Rainier was mostly clear as was the Stuart range.  Eastern and Northern views were turly stunning with Glacier Peak, Pugh, Sloan and well into the North Cascades.   After and hour of alpine slackery we began our descent.  

[img:38t5enpv]http&#58;//lh6&#46;ggpht&#46;com/_cmsGJSU3p2s/Sso6oWD-WFI/AAAAAAAAEeU/uC7LMjPjAQg/s720/DSC_2616e&#46;jpg[/img:38t5enpv]

Once out of Gothic Basin I had us stop so that I could wring out my sloshing boots - note to self: bring gators anytime after the first snow, no matter how small.  We made great time bombing back down the trial to Barlow Pass arriving well before sunset.

[img:38t5enpv]http&#58;//lh5&#46;ggpht&#46;com/_cmsGJSU3p2s/Sso6tKeyAGI/AAAAAAAAEfA/SAVOjo7P_n4/s720/DSC_2719e&#46;jpg[/img:38t5enpv]

A phenomenal day out in the mountains with a great partner and amazing views, who could ask for anything more.

Side Note: It took me a while, but I eventually figured out which of the Monte Cristos was Foggy Peak.  It only took me so long because I could not accept that Foggy was as steep as it looked.  I am quite impressed that Brian got me up to attempt that peak twice."
,"Dorado Needle and Klawatti Peak","Dorado Needle and Klawatti Peak

Nick and I returned to the Eldorado Icecap over Memorial Day weekend to tackle some unfinished business from last year.  On a four day outing with Valerie in August, we were unable to access Klawatti Peak and Dorado Needle due to late season moat issues.  This weekend, we had great snow all the way up!

We donned our heavy packs and set out on the Eldorado Creek trail on Saturday morning.  The trail was melted out, but we hit snow near the top of the second boulder field which took us up to the lower camps (~6000 ft).  Several skiers passing us on their way down warned us of soft snow slides higher up, and when we reached the camps we saw just what they were talking about.  The entire ridgeline that we needed to climb to get to Eldorado glacier was in various stages of avalanching (from shallow debris to hanging cornices!).  With the heat of the day baring down on us, we decided to wait until morning to give it a go.

With a 5 am start the next day, we found the snow nicely consolidated, and we safely gained the ridge (whew!).  We made great time up the glacier, traversed the Inspiration glacier, and made it to the McCallister col by 8 am.  A team of four had already set out about an hour ahead of us, so we had great steps leading to the base of the route up Dorado Needle.

To access the route, which is described as 2-3 pitches of 5.4 climbing, we first climbed a short section of steep snow (Nick belayed me up).  

[url=http&#58;//outdoors&#46;webshots&#46;com/photo/2339673540103926705pdSpXX:3v6pq9rh][img:3v6pq9rh]http&#58;//inlinethumb05&#46;webshots&#46;com/35460/2339673540103926705S600x600Q85&#46;jpg[/img:3v6pq9rh][/url:3v6pq9rh]

We then caught up with the party ahead and took our turn on the 2 pitches of mixed steep snow and rock.  The highlight of the climb is a ~10 ft section of au cheval near the summit!

The top was sunny and calm, so we were in no hurry to leave while we waited for the other group to take turns downclimbing/rappelling the route.  Snowshoes were great for the trip back to the col, and we were back in camp by 3 pm.  

We had a leisurely afternoon in camp with lots of photography and snow melting.  We decided to climb Klawatti on Monday morning, hoping for more consolidation overnight. 

[url=http&#58;//outdoors&#46;webshots&#46;com/photo/2768961640103926705xHBRKN:3v6pq9rh][img:3v6pq9rh]http&#58;//inlinethumb28&#46;webshots&#46;com/44507/2768961640103926705S600x600Q85&#46;jpg[/img:3v6pq9rh][/url:3v6pq9rh] 

At 6:30 am we roped out and set out to Klawatti col, which took around 30 minutes to reach.  The sun was already heating up the snow on the glacier, but we found the snow slopes leading up Klawatti to be in excellent condition.  The route follows the west-facing slope directly up (40-50 degrees) for ~1000 feet, then we traversed left to gain the NW face, which was slightly less steep.  We both agreed that a second tool would have been nice, although not necessary.  We were at the summit in one hour from the col.

Looking up the west face

Downclimbing the route took almost as long as going up because we had to back down most of the way, but we experienced no problems during the descent.  We then began the long trip back to the trailhead, arriving at the car with tired legs at 4 pm.

"index","Davis-Holland / Loving Arms","Jason and I climbed it on Saturday.  We were hoping for better style (redpoint), but instead we each needed (wimped out) to take some hangs.  I knew I wasn't having a good day after hacking up loogies from my ex-cold trying to keep up with Jason on the approach, shitting a lovely oatmeal consistency, and taking a hang on the friggin' first pitch, the easiest pitch of the route (ok, so it was wet).  Actually I felt pretty darn winded and almost light-headed by the top of the 1st pitch, no doubt thanks to the outs earlier in the morning.  I regained some energy once I put some food and water in me, but still neither of us were having good days.  I guess that's what happens when you get out every weekend climbing &lt;=5.9 in the alpine and then surprise yourself with 5.10.\

Most of my pictures suck (it's a hard route to photograph with just 2 people -- I have several overexposed foreshortened buttshots that really blow turdmonkeys), but here are the best:\

\
The way we went up was safer and much brushier than the route we took down, which was very steep timber cut by several cliff bands.  \
\
This was a full-on Cascades adventure.  Roughest drivable road I have ever been on in this state, difficult routefinding, mandatory steep and rough bushwacking, cliff bands, exposure, and loose scrambling.  These were punctuated by a beautifully maintained river trail, pleasant boulder fields, polished granite slabs, a smooth, bare glacier, and amazing views.  Had some issues on the way down, barely passed the last cliff band by dark, and had to share one headlamp as we waded the river and took the trail the rest of the way out.  It's why I love these mountains."
"index","Index 9/30","J. Stern, Boyd, Dug, and I climbed some great pitches at Index last Saturday.  We ran into Stephanie and Dallas at the Sultan Bakery, Mike Schmitt and Yuko in the parking lot, and later caught a brief glimpse of Scott and Eric as they rushed off down the trail to \""log some air time\"".\
\
It was Dug's first day crack climbing, so we schooled him good, starting off in the Toxic Shock area and then moving on to the GNS.  He struggled mightily and made his way up cracks of all sizes that day, stumbling back to the car sore and happy.  This proves that with a little tape, a little fitness, and hard work, you can make a great day of it at Index without any prior crack-climbing experience.\
\
Josh returned to non-supervised climbing after several weeks of his self-rescue course and got his lead head back.  At the end of the day, he and Dug did GNS while Boyd and I climbed Roger's Corner/Breakfast of Champions.\
\
Boyd bled all over several routes, as we have come to expect.  He went for it on Toxic Shock, his hardest lead to date, and tested my yellow Alien once or twice.  What a great pitch that is!  Toxic Shock is drier than when I was there last and there was no one else there, despite the parking lot being packed with cars.\
\
We set a TR on Even Steven and I finally got up it without falling.  My fingers were all numb at the top and I still need to come back and lead it.  The first part would be the hardest for me, I think, because you have to commit to a hard lieback protected by small cams (maybe a nut?) that I'm not quite sure will keep you from hitting the pillar.  Above that, you get a couple good rests and the gear looks great.\
\
All in all, a great day with fun partners."
,"Artist Point / Picture Lake","Pravin was tired of living vicariously through my photos and asked me to take him to the mountains.  I borrowed Kevin's Nikon D200 with the 18-200 lens, which I'm considering purchasing next year.  We had a great time, and the camera performed well, considering I really didn't know how to use it (I didn't realize it was in ISO400 the entire time).  I'm going to have to relearn completely from scratch how to process raw files.\

"Ingalls-peaks","Soggy fun at Ingalls Lake-8 October 2006","The first scramble of fall quarter found 15 of us headed east in hopes of dodging the rain and the clouds for a ramble into the larch country of Headlight Basin, good times, baked goods and mountain goat sittings.  \
\
4 out of 5 ain't bad.\
\
For many folks in our hearty group it was their first time on a UWCC trip or-in a few cases-adventure into the Cascades: Anna Hohl, Ben McDonald, Claire Landowski, Claudius Loth, the Jon trio of: Jon Duke, Jon Philips and Jonathan Toner, and Sequoia Freund (a fabulous 9-month old golden retriever).\
\
For some, Stephanie Savage, Dallas Anderson, Kevin Steffa, Ethan Welty and myself, it was a reunion of the first UWCC attempt at Ingalls Peak.  \
\
And for Jim Prager it was time to get out to the hills once more.\
\
We arrived at the trailhead around 9:00 am and found the parking lot to be packed.  Steph and I were surprised as we'd both been up there on sunny, blue bird-sky weekends in the past where we'd only seen a few hikers or climbers on the trail.  No matter, we were soon headed up and trying to will away the cloud cover with our predictions of sunny skies by the time we made it to the pass.  \
	\
The rains made their presence known not long after we started switchbacking up the Ingalls Way trail.  At first it was a little spittle and then a solid soaking.  At a group reconvening point everyone seemed warm enough, dry enough and was having a good time so we carried on to Ingalls Pass.  Once there, the rains abated and the golden needles of the larch made up for the lack of sunshine in the sky.\
\
We traversed across the grassy meadows, thickets of subalpine fir and (of course) yellow larch of the basin to Ingalls Lake. There, we saw a mother mountain goat and her kid across the water.  They proved to be the best view from the lake since a thick layer of clouds enclosed Ingalls Peak and South Ingalls Peak up above.  Less enthused about the lack of summit views, we nixed the idea of a scramble to the top and decided it was high time for some burly bars and snickerdoodles.  Distant flute music lingered around the lake and through the mist as we fueled up and explored surrounding rocks.\
\
Occasional sun breaks and sucker holes dotted the sky as we trekked back down the trail.  But we weren't to be tricked again.  We made it back to the cars before 3:00 and were soon in Roslyn in search of food and beer.  However, no such luck in finding an all-ages friendly restaurant with good food and drinks, so we headed back to Seattle.  A vote in favor of Thai food soon had us warming up with spicy curries and green tea.\
\
Good times had by all and many more Cascades adventures to come.\
\
Claire, Jim and Stephanie many thanks to you for driving.\
Brad and Sammy, great to see you along the trail. \
Tim, sorry if we missed you while we were in Headlight Basin.\
If someone has pics, do share!\
\
And an FYI, the Roslyn Brewery has a fine dark lager (Roslyn Beer), light lager (Brookside Beer) and a quality rootbeer (#9 Rootbeer)."

,"Gothic Basin Sleepover - 06/09/29:30","We had only been back a few days from our three week trip across Yellowstone, Tetons, Zion, Bryce and Grand Canyon National Parks that my mom suggested I skip my Friday classes to take her backpacking in the Cascades. I joyfully agreed and by noon we were at the trailhead.\
\
She was not so joyfully surprised by the trailbuilding habits of burly impatient miners...but after several hours was much content with the rocky wonderland that is Gothic Basin, and our lonesome camp at Foggy Lake.\

Yeah, yeah, I didn't climb Del Campo. I had to get back early Saturday for a classical guitar concert at Benaroyah. What? Wanna fight about it!? I did explore the basin and found, among other things, an enormously deep chasm with a waterfall and a mine shaft besides it.  Can you find it?"
"leavenworth-area-climbs","Leavenworth Cragging CC.com Ropeup","Cruised over to LW for the CC ropeup this past weekend.  Had a great time, although UWCC was a bit underrepresented.  On Saturday Chuck S. and I headed up to Careno for some great cragging.  We started on Bale-Kramer, which I had climbed P1-3 before.  It is a good climb, but only the crack pitch is really stellar.  The 2nd pitch is fun, but a bit contrived given the easy crack 6 ft to the right.  At the top tier we started on pocketmeister, which I thought was great.  The only downside is the bolts next to pro when nearly anybody who made it up there could be expected to have a rack.  The climb starts out fun and steep, then moves on to a rather sequency pocketed slab.  Next we climbed P4 Bale Kramer which was pretty good.  On the walk off we stopped to climb Condo Corner.  This is a stellar climb.  Starts in a sweet corner crack, then turns to hard stemming before a good rest and the crux roof.  Back at the base of Careno we decided to do the regular route.  IMO this route is way better than BK.  I was a bit scared of the crack as I had heard some ankle breaker stories.  Eventually, I sacked up and went for it.  I made it through the crack with a little sweating, then opted for the bolted face variation to finish the pitch.  I made it cleanly up the last bolt, but couldnt nail the final crimpy sequence.  After one short fall with a bolt above, i figured out the difficult (for me) moves.  The next pitch is the much acclaimed 5.7 corner crack.  This is an awesome pitch, its just too bad it isnt longer.  The next 5.8 pitch is also excellent with fun stems and jams past a steep bulge.  The last pitch starts with a hard move that chuck and I spent some time examining to figure out the best sequence.  Eventually we noticed a 00 TCU placement to protect the moves.  With gear overhead, chuck pulled through the start without much problem.  Higher in the pitch things get hard again and chuck took a short fall below a jingus 0 TCU.  Surprisingly it held and the next go chuck made it through.  Another great pitch, but maybe a bit heady on lead now that a fixed pin has blown (where the 0 TCU went).  \
\
Saturday night had a bunch of great slide shows including Wayne's recent mongo ridge solo traverse and an abbreviated presentation of Colin's alaska climb.  Sunday was a bit of a late start and weather was threatening (a little rain overnight).  Matt and I decided to go check out Peshastin.  Amazingly when we arrived at the state park, we found it closed for winter (in october,WTF).  We drove back to LW just as the rain started to intensify.  After a breif break to check out the Salmon in the wenatchee, we headed back home.  \

"Forbidden-peak","E Ridge Forbidden - 10/14/06","John Toner and I hooked up on a beautifaul fall day for a car-to-car climb of the E Ridge of Forbidden.  It was John's first taste of N Cascades alpine (new to the area, but climbed a bunch eslewhere), and for myself, a fitting end to a fine summer of climbing.  We had the ridge to ourselves, and snuck the route in hours before the snow started flying.  All in all, a stellar day in one of my favorite spots on earth!  \
\
-------\
\
We got a healthy 4 AM start from the road, and cruised up to the basin under moonlight and clear skies.  The forecast was for PM clouds and a vigorous front that evening, so we kept a quick pace.  First light found us on the ridge proper, freezing our asses off in the wind as the sun peeked over the hills.  Blue skies with some clouds advancing from the west.  \

\
As we racked up, a couple of climbers showed up that we're also planning on the E ridge.  They watched us cast off, but they apparantley bailed and that was the last we saw of them(or anyone else) for the rest of the day.  \
\
We simuled the whole route, except for the rap and the 5.8 step.  The quality did not disappoint.\

\
Other than the weather (which got us jittery mid day when the clouds started rolling in quickly), my only concern had been the amount of freshies on the E ledges descent.  There was spotty new snow, but not enough to complicate things.  However, John got his first taste of Cascade good-ness when we both took too high a traverse and found ourselves in diffucult, exposed and shitty terrain.  We got back to the lone tower safely, and spent the rest of the daylight hours descending to tree-line and soaking in some awesome fall colors with ominous weather filling in.  \

[img:30zwtpbz]http&#58;//students&#46;washington&#46;edu/jre2/2&#46;jpg[/img:30zwtpbz]\
\
As we hoofed back to the car, darkness overtook us, and the first few spits of rain were flying out of the clouds.  Surely there'd be a foot of fresh over the next couple of days.  We were tired as hell, but we didn't care.  We'd snuck 'er in."
"index","Index","Scott and I went to index yesterday and it was predictably awesome.  We started with godzilla through sloe children.  Above sloe children Scott lead an awesome new pitch that uses almost very granite climbing technique imagenable except handjams.  But if you like friction moves, stemming, knee bars, face climbing, underclings, pulling roofs on huge jugs and a few chimney than I suggest you do it.  I don't know what its called, just step left off the sloe children belay aim for the bolts taking you through two roofs, some small gear is need to protect a couple of moves.\
\
After that I lead full sagitarus and some how managed to hanging on despite shanky uncontrollably after pulling the crux roof.\
\
Scott rounded out the day with an onsight of batskins to the first anchor.  I'm suprised that I had never seen anyone climb this route because it is a good 11a right at the base of the lower town wall, just left of godzilla."
"Hurricane-peak","Ridge Ramlbing around Hurricane Peak - 10/21-10/22","Jen, Ethan, and I set out from the Boulder Lake trailhead on a crisp Saturday morning with the intention of climbing Mt. Chaval.  Though this proved too lofty a goal, good times were still had by all.\
\
We made good time to Boulder Lake (little under 2hrs - compared to 6+ in the snow last Nov), then had a classic vertical bushwhack on frozen heather up to the series of benches above Pear Lake.  We crossed the ridge between Pear and Toketie Lakes near the Ester Island Head and took a while to soak in the views to the west.  Our route to the north took us over slabs and well-consolidated talus before reaching the start of an improbably thin ridge traverse.  We were making good time, but with three hours of daylight left we were only about 2/3 of the way along the connecting ridge to Chaval with no beta on the descent to a camp at Chaval Lake.  Deciding not to thrash ourselves on this venture, we chose to turn around and made a sporty descent to Lake Kawkawak where we pitched our tents in at a primo site.  As the sun dropped in the sky and the peaks behind us reflected a rosy hue, we spent our time doing some alpine bouldering (much harder in mountaineering boots).\
\
The next morning, we got a lazy start, before heading up to the summit of Hurricane Peak.  Despite the immense relief as seen from Boulder Lake, the peak is actually quite mellow from the back side.  Reversing our course, we dropped back over the pass and headed back down the heather benches where we picked up a well-beaten climber's trail.  Built a few cairns on the way down to mark the route better.\
\
Back to the car by 3:30 and Seattle a bit after 6.  Ethan's got some pictures.  This time in Darrington he was not, in fact, chased by a dog.\
\
Approach beta: Pear to Toketie Lake\
\
Cross the outlet of Peak Lake and turn right (south).  About two hundred yards south of the outlet there is an obvious weakness in the cliff bands (in early season there is probably a fair bit of water coming down here).  Ascend mossy rock (class 2 max) to the top of the gully (~100 feet above the lakeshore).  Exit to climber's left and you're on bootpath.\
\
Take bootpath to base of talus fan and proceed directly up a narrowing gully and head to climber's right when the gully forks.  Again, at the top you will encounter a well-defined bootpath.  Take this up to another talus field.  Here, ascend directly up first talus, then heather, to reach the ridge at an obvious low point.  The krumholtz has been trimmed back here to make crossing the ridge easier."
,"Broken Gate at Exit 38","[img:389c0slo]http&#58;//www&#46;astro&#46;washington&#46;edu/cowan/outdoors/2006/broken_draw&#46;jpg[/img:389c0slo]\
Rok and i headed up to Exit 38 hoping to climb lots of 5.10's at Amazonia. We found the good climbs wet and the bad climbs... well, bad. We decided to check out Bob's Area but walked too far up the path (most of the way up Mt Washington, in fact!). We evenutualy realized our mistake and retraced our steps, ended up climbing at Chainsaw Wall, first on a horribly awkward 5.8, then on an equally bad 10b. When Rok hung on a draw the gate broke, leading to some tense moments... I cleaned the route on rappel then we beat a hasty retreat to the Rogue Brewery."

,"Rialto to Cedar Creek","For something different this weekend, Frank and I opted to head to the coast for a relaxing and leisurely walk.  Friday night, after sampling the delightful variety of music, dance and food at the Folklife Festival, we ended up walking back to Fremont along scenic Aurora to discover a very dead battery where there once was life in Frank’s Jetta.  Hoping for the best, we got a jump and planned for an early morning departure south, then north, then west.  This was not to be, as Frank’s ridiculously early morning phone call announced, so after finding a neighbor for a jump, locating a battery, and installing it, we had a slow start for a long drive.  The Hood Canal Bridge was closed, so we headed to Olympia and then back north, where we encountered serious traffic approaching Hoodsport (what is in Hoodsport anyway, and why do so many towns have ridiculous names?).  Along the way, we noticed a trend in “Giant Things”, mainly large statues of hamburgers and ice cream cones.  
We stopped at the Port Angeles ranger station to obtain permit and bear canisters, and finally were ready to start hiking at 5:30.  We began our trek at Rialto Beach and planned to camp the first night at Chilean Memorial, a few miles up the beach.  Rialto Beach is beautiful, but the wet gravel made for slow travel and we were always glad for a change of terrain, especially to slabs interspersed with stunning tide pools.  At Hole in the Wall, we had our first starfish encounter and found some beautiful anemones.  
<!-- m --><a class=\""postlink\"" href=\""http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/2vmrrUbqT5N-UsExze5osA?feat=directlink\"">http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/2v ... directlink</a><!-- m -->

We approached Chilean Memorial about sunset and set up camp with a little bit of remodeling and excavating for a flat space.  We carried enough food to feed a small army for a month, with camp set up we ate a hearty dinner, complete with wine and dessert!  
Sunday morning brought cloudy skies which burned to blue as the day progressed.  We had two long headlands to get around at low tide, they were mainly medium boulders and a bit tedious, but once  past Cape Johnson we were met with gorgeous sandy beaches.  We camped at Cedar Creek and arrived early in the day; the afternoon was spent exploring the beaches, finding sea life, and drawing pictures in the sand, that beautiful big chalkboard erased twice a day.  Dinner was once again delicious and substantial and the sunset picturesque.  With an abundant supply of driftwood, we had a small campfire and told stories, trading off “chapters” which was a lot of fun and some exciting plot twists.  There were many suicide insects interested in the fire.
Monday morning was again cloudy with high humidity to the point of suggesting condensation.  At breakfast we watched a bald eagle hang out on a rock in the ocean.  We broke camp in record time, 24 minutes, and started walking aiming to hit all the headlands before overland trails were necessary.  The first 5 miles went really fast; it was amazing how different the beaches looked walking south and with a much lower tide.  Even the boulder sections seemed a little easier but we slowed down a little.  We reached Hole in the Wall right at 12 as tide was just barely too high to get through.  It would probably have been fine, but there was also a family watching to see how “the backpackers” were going to approach the problem.  We took the safe route and retreated to the overland route.  With the end in sight, we stopped for a long lunch and dragged our feet getting back to Seattle after such a relaxing and beautiful weekend.  
The drive back was enjoyable with slow traffic in Hoodsport again and on I-5.  This was my first trip to the coast in recent history and I immensely enjoyed it, the wildlife and scenery were spectacular and I hope to travel more in the Olympics when a bit more snow melts!   <!-- s:lol: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif\"" alt=\"":lol:\"" title=\""Laughing\"" /><!-- s:lol: -->

"Mount-forgotten","Mt. Forgotten - 11/18/06","The UWCC tried to take Mt. Forgotten by shear numbers this past Saturday, but turned back shortly after the meadows due to some logistical problems (drivers going for summit with multiple passengers waiting in meadow or heading back).\
\
In embracing the theme of Mt. Forgotten, I forgot my boots back in Seattle and discovered that tennis shoes are an interesting choice of footwear for snowshoeing.  I recommend this approach to no one.\
\
Encountered snow a bit before Perry Creek falls and donned snowshoes in the forest beyond.  Meadows were pristine and snow conditions were quite solid.  \
\
Thanks to all who came out, especially Aric and Stephanie for driving.\
\
Ethan has some great pictures, so I'll just post a few here.\

,"the approach to class, 1500M wi1 m1","Watched some girl take a 2 and a half footer right on her back.  This is definetly one of those thin ice and mixed climbs that only comes in for a few hours each season.  Thankfully, access is so easy almost everyone can tick it.  I did it twice because it was so good.  The ice was generally only a 1/4 inch think requiring delicate folkwork.  The m1 grade comes from the few clear spots of road and the handrail that was used, classic mixed climbing.  Unlike most mix routes the crux is where ever you find the most sustained featureless ice, in my case the sidewalk on the north side of condon.\

"Snoqualmie-mountain","A most successful walk up Mount Snoqualmie - 12/28","WHO? Kevin Steffa, his colleague Didzis Beitlers, Christina Ngo, and myself.\
HOW? skis and snowshoes!\
\
We pulled up to the Alpental parking lot by 9am, crossed the road and soon found a track that would eventually lead us to victory, summiting Mount Snoqualmie under a clear blue sky, with sweeping views in all directions. Kevin skied gracefully down through the fluffy powder, the rest of us leaping after him in our snowshoes, and we were back down in no time at all, just before sunset.\

,"Alpental Opening Day","Opening Day at Alpental found Josh, Ralph, and I getting ready to head up to the Pass after organizing at the very last moment the night before (Midnight). Serendipitously, we ran into Stephen and his friend Marina who joined us for the days tour. We ascended the snow lake divide and popped above the valley cloud layer. \

A great valley so close to town with an abundance of touring options. Lots of avalanche terrain around, but also many forested areas and ridgelines, so its a good place to evaluate and pick your own route rather than just following the track. I'll be back again!\

"Guye-peak","You have to have a funny title, AKA S Gully of Guye","Sunday morning, Stephanie and I got our usual not so alpine start after some hemming and hawing that went like.......\
\""I'm sick.\""  Stephanie.\
\""It's up to you,\"" I replied (ie I really want to climb today.)\
\
When we hit the pass the temperature read 10 Fergenhiez, which is the same as -14 Centrifuge, or 2 on the beard ice scale.  We started hiking on a solid crust from the Sahalie Ski and Fascism Society, where, coincidentally we were not allowed to park.  \
\
Stephanie carried her snowshoes and I left mine in the car.  Ultimately, it turned out that we didn't need them.  We angled up a slope to where we thought we would either be in our gully or be able to see our gully.  Somewhere on this slope we took out our ice stabbers and put on our clamps.  When we got to the high ground scout about place we realized it was our gully so we climbed it.\
\
At this point we had crampons, one ax, and no rope.  As the gully became increasingly steep and sustained, we realized that we should be roped up and using our second tools.\
\
Eventually we came to a moat and roped up just in time for the  SWEET ASS MIXED CLIMBING.  I was rambling about how bitchin it was and whatnot when I heard Steph define it as AWESOME.  Anyway, after some more snow and some more mixed and some more snow we reached the south summit.  Then we had to downclimb, climb, downclimb, climb to reach the north summit.\
\
We feasted on a late lunch of bagels, pb&j, chocolate, and Thai death peanuts.  The descent sucked as the few inches on powder was not enough to hold over the solid ice sheet.  We got lots of self arrest practice.\
\
There was some kind of inversion thingy going on where we were able to wear only a light fleece or Goodwill sweater all day, but it was cold below the cloud layer.  The route was in pretty solid shape with a few soft spots in the sun.  Overall, it was a very enjoyable climb with plenty of fun snow climbing, some mixed, and even a patch of water ice.  Plus, wicked easy access.  Get out there and crank it.\
\
On the way home, we stopped for some Savage Indian food and birthday carrot cake.  Mmmmmm.\
\
Gear:  Pickets were quite handy, as were double length slings for trees.  Ax and a tool was about right for this climb.  Stoppers were carried, but not placed.  Snowshoes were not needed on this day anyway.\
\
Pictures might follow if my computer doesn't still suck tomorrow.\

Last summer we did the Improbable Traverse, but it was fun to re-climb a mountain in a different season and by a completely different route.  It gave the climb a unique feel, but the same Guye issues of summit egress were still present."
"Chair-peak","Chair NEB - 1/14/07","Aaron and I climbed it Sunday under blue-bird skies and ball-chilling temps.  The mountain was busy, with two other parties sharing our route, a party on the north face, and a party on the East gulley?(descent route).  The general consensus of others was that the route was in fatter-than-usual condition on the steep portions.  The highlight of the climb was the first pitch, where we climbed a left variation that crossed a snow covered rib of rock, then headed straight up steep, beutiful neve that was nearly vertical through the mid-section.  Aaron was spot on when he compared the experience to the neve-equivalent of a splitter hand crack.  The party behind us opted for the right(standard?) variation, which they also reported to be excellent climbing. There was a bit of a cluster above, when all three parties converged on the ice bulge/constriction at the same time.  We got through it with something short of finesse, but enjoyed fat, good quality(but short) ice on the bulge-proper.  The low-point of the climb followed shortly above, when I hollered at Aaron to stop so that I could double over in misery with screaming-barfie hands.  Good times.   We teamed up with the other two parties at the top of the cornice and got down in one double-rap.  The sun was just setting on what was a perfect winter day in the hills.  It's raining and 40 degrees in Seattle this week, but let's hope the streets ice over again soon  <!-- s8) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cool.gif\"" alt=\""8)\"" title=\""Cool\"" /><!-- s8) --> .\

"Hex-mountain","United Nations convenes on Hex Mountain","Early Sunday morning a group of delegates consisting of an Italian metalhead, a Canadian expatriate, a quasi-Frenchman, and an American hillyuppie piled into the official UN staff transport, the wax wagon, and headed for Roslyn.   Snowshoeing from the Salmon la Sac road was chosen as a much needed break from the tedium of those long conferences at Geneva that invariably end with ascents of Alpine classics and sauna time with Swiss misses.\
\
A detour to Cle Elum for baked good found the bakery to be closed, which all nations agreed was unacceptible.  A coffee shop provided the necessary sweets, though Aldo was disappointed by the lack of Swedish female representation at said coffee shop.\
\
Anyway, upon reaching the Subaru parking zone (not kidding, and I'm so ashamed) the delegates put on their togs and began snowshoeing under cloudy skies.  Consensus was achieved that it was pretty warm and a nice day for the most part.  The delegates cut switchbacks and eventually reached a trailhead.  The trail was a remnant from a previous UN outing on which Kruschev severely injured a translator when he flung his snowshoe at a Japanese delegate in a fit of rage after being laughed at when he postholed and flailed about helplessly like an overturned turtle.\
\
The party reached a ridge with some impressive cornices and followed it to the summit.  Unfortunately, violence erupted on the ridge when the United States enacted a hostile takeover, by snowmobile, to enforce its resolution that a pressure cooker is not, in fact, the same thing as a crock pot.  A panel of scientists, armed with the equation pv=nrt provided expert testimony that a pressure cooker cooks faster whereas a crock pot provides a slow simmmer.\
\
Lunch was held on the summit and some excellent quiches were provided by the French committee.  Tea time was also taken by several delegates.  In the meantime, Ethan subjected some sovereign bodies to a seemingly endless tyrade about artistic merit when all they really wanted was a summit photo.  \
\
Party members often disagreed about the proper descent path, as well as whether or not those really were yeti tracks in the drainage.  However, the most heated debate occurred when the delegate from Luxembourg mentioned meat fondue and the French delegation grew outraged and contested that by defintion, fondue must contain a melted medium.  There were a few tense moments, but ultimately things were diffused by UN resolution 185.63A which states that, \""if it involves a stick and a pot, it's yummy.\""  This resolution will henceforth be known as the Cheese and Broth Accord.\
\
All countries agreed that snowmobilers are icky, but it was good to be back to the car at a reasonable hour.\
\
Photographic minutes will be provided by Prime Minister Welty."
"Red-mountain-snoqualmie","A surprisingly smooth ascent of Red Mountain via SW Ridge","Red Mountain, which is one of those Snoqualmie Peaks, has been on my ticklist for quite some time.  Well, since about 2 weeks ago when I saw it in the Nelson book.  Ethan agreed to accompany me on my life's quest.  Avy danger was low and there was a surface crust so we had to slam it doooooowwwwwwn.  We left Seattle at 6ish, myself on 3 hours of sleep and Ethan on about 4. \
\
I have to admit that when I picked Ethan up I expected the day to amount to nothing more than a giant debacle.  I walked in his front door and observed a pair of step-in crampons, some non-step-in boots, a hammer, and a pair of pliers.  He asked if I had any suggestions for rectifying his gear woes and I admitted that I couldn't conjure up anything better than duct tape.  He threw in some bungee cords for good measure and we were off.\
\
We hit the trail at about 8/830 and basically followed tracks and made some of our own while meandering through the woods on a trajectory more or less towards Red mt.  There were a few caravans of skiers, but no other hard men to speak of.......(huh?)\
\
After some more wandering we hit the avy debris that marked the time for the moment of truth.......Long story short, Ethan's crampons managed to work.  We started climbing at 10something.  We went up the ridge because that's what one does when one is climbing a ridge.  \
\
It got windy.  It got hard-to-breath-when-you-face-it windy.  It got free-exfoliation windy.  You get the idea. \
\
We had a punctual noon time lunch on the summit, hunkered out of the wind.  Plunge stepping was fun as always on the descent.  Ethan almost lost his pants at one point, but he pulled through.\
\
Side note:  We ran into a couple who Stephanie and I  had met in Leavenworth last fall. They were part of one of the skiravans and we ended up chatting a bit.  It's a small mountainous world!\
\
Unfortunately the skiers didn't get to ski most of the descent because of the heinous crust.  Anyway, we made it down in one piece, but were thoroughly disappointed to learn that Red Mountain Coffee no longer carries the gigantic cinnamon twist, size of your head thing that we had after our Tooth fiasco.  It was little consolation that the bear claws are \""pretty big.\""  Eff that.\
\
Anyway, it was a beautiful day in the mountains with views from Baker to St. Helens.  I love this stuff!  \
\
Gear notes:  Snowshoes were cool for a bit of the descent as it softened up, but on the whole were probably unnecessary with the conditions.  Crampons and axe are all you need.  We carried a second tool, rope, pickets, and a bunch of other shizzle we didn't use.  Fun snow climb though."
"Chair-peak","Chair Peak - NEB","Did it saturday morning, was pretty fun.  It was so clear outside we had some amazing views.  but the wind was so fricken strong.\
\
Took us 4hrs 15 mins car to summit, 1hr 15 down & then a leisurely hike out.  Great boot pack right now.  Oh Erik ended up putting a screw in at the start that hit rock and then I put a nut in above the ice step.  Basically great for soloing right now, but a bunch of wallowing on the upper snowfield.\

"mcclellan-butte","McClellan Butte North Couloir","Acting on the wisdom of Mr. Bodenner's recommendation, Stephanie and I cranked McClellan Butte yesterday with beautiful snow and weather conditions.  We left Seattle early and hit the trailhead at about 6:45 am.  We started hiking the icy, compact trail shortly thereafter and Stephanie gave it a rating of AI1.  We even considered hiking in crampons.  The trail started to switchback and we went crosscountry to a clearing at the base of the couloir.\

\
We put on our crampons and harnesses, but held off with the rope.  We enjoyed moderate/easy climbing on firm snow for quite a while.  In the top 1/3 or so of the couloir things started to get steeper so we exited stage right for a safety break.  After roping up and breaking out the second tool, Stephanie took the first official lead.\

I started to lead the thin ice on unprotectable rock, but opted for the retreat method.  I picked a new line, farther left, with slightly less thin ice on unprotectable rock and tried again.  After my first bit of legitimate ice climbing EVER , I slung two bushes in a vegetative equalization protection system and headed up more ice to a dihedral.  At this point, I spent about 20 minutes swearing and knocking ice down on Stephanie.  Eventually, I dug through enough snow to place a nut.  More swearing.  I wedged myself in the chimney/dihedral thing and trashed some more.  Finally some grovelling and terror sweat got me onto the ridge with a final dry tool desperation heave and mantel.  It was f'ed up.  I built an anchor and sat back to enjoy the views while Stephanie sent it with style to spare.\
\
Anyway, enough of that.  After a small rock traverse and some more snow climbing,  we made it.  \

\
After lunch we downclimbed some soft snow on the southeastish face and followed a skier's tracks (more or less) back to the trail.  This time we did use crampons on some of the trail.  We took a scenic walk on the Iron Horse (is that the name?) road when we both spaced out on the descent.  We made it back to the car just before dark for a 10.5 hour day.  \
\
I left my gloves on top of the car, which gave me an excuse to buy new ones.  Another great day in the mountains.  \
\
We used an ax, one tool, crampons, 30m rope, pickets, slings, and a light rock rack.  Screws probably wouldn't have been much good, other than looking hard core."
"Mount-rainier","Mt. Rainier Fuhrer Finger day- Attempt","Met up with Eli, a frequent TAY poster. We wanted to Fuhrer finger in a day. It is totally doable.. we just didn't know the right way... 

Got up to Paradise and were skinning by 9:00 on Wednesday night. Started skinning. The frozen snow was fun to skin, but we didn't put our ski-crampons on until after we dropped into the Nisqually basin and started ascent the Wilson glacier. We followed boot and skin tracks of people that were probably doing the Kautz.  While we were ascending we heard some massive rock falls, likely from Wilson headwall. Scared us a bit, especially as we were ascending an avalanche debris area. 

Got to the Turtle by 1:30, didn't trust going across the Wilson glacier (even though it was close, and we didn't really need to worry about it) so we enjoyed a 3-hr shiver fest as we waited for light. Got going up by 5:00am. The Wilson was exceptionally easy to cross, no glacier gear was used, the cross was easy. Made it to near top of the finger (11k feet) by 8:00, but decided conditions weren't good for an ascent, didn't like the not fully consolidated stuff no4 and the rock-bullets that were coming at us during our ascent.

Proceeded to blargh our way down the finger, inconsistent on crusted-corn- or hard snow. 

Stats: 16miles 5.5k feet.

Gear Unused: Glacier gear. 
Gear used: crampons, ski crampons, whippet/iceaxe

"Red-mountain-snoqualmie","A pretty nice little Saturday on Red Mountain 2/3/2007","Taking a break from nursing school studies and forestry antics, Stephanie and I decided to make a short day of going up Red Mountain.  We booted up in the Snoqualmie parking lot and were on the trail by 8:00.  Where most folks turn left to go up the snowshoe highway to Commonwealth Basin-we both presuming the other knew where she was going-went right onto the PCT and summer route to Red Mountain (according to the wooden sign just barely poking out of the snow).  Ten minutes later we realized we weren’t going up nor in the direction that Dallas had described.  No matter, we looked at the map and headed in a bearing that eventually put us on the main route.  In the woods the snow on the trail was compact and crusty, but on our cross country route there were a few open spots where we were sinking down enough that we decided to put on our snowshoes.\
\
We wandered through Commonwealth Basin, fending off our cheese and cookies from the Gray Jay Mafia… apparently these days they are even going after salami.   Having followed the boot track, a little after 10:00 we were on the bottom rib of the SW ridge of Red.  We started heading up in snowshoes, but after 200 feet or so of steeper terrain we figured it was time to go boots, ice ax and pole-style.  Our early-ish start had meant we had had the mountain to ourselves, until then, when a couple of skiers came into view below us; we started playing leap from with them up to the summit.  The snow was icy where others’ boots had blazed the route (and there were a lot of boot tracks) but the untrampled snow wasn’t so bad for kicking steps.  We hoofed up several hundred feet more to a flattish spot where Steph good naturedly humored my desire to wear crampons and practice keeping my gaiters intact.  Crampons on, we continued heading up, now opting for some mixed rock and ice instead of just plunking up through the snow.  Made it to the top by 11:15.  Shared some cookies with our two summit compatriots and took in the views: Thompson stood out in the foreground, Stuart loomed in the east and even the base of Glacier was in site.\
\
Watching the clouds come in, we headed down plunge step-style as the next round snowboarders and skiers plodded up.  Near the base of the SW ridge we ran into Ralph, Josh, Tim and another buddy of theirs.  Our conversation went something like this:\
\
“Hey guys.”\
“Hey girls.”\
“Ralph, we thought you and Ben were going to be meeting up with Dallas and Brian to climb Whitehorse.”\
“Nope, decided not to.  Ben’s going to Target today.”\
“Target? Really?”\
“Yeah.” \
“Is he going to the Olive Garden too?”\
“They’ve got those good breadsticks.”\
“Sounds like he’s got a pretty nice little Saturday planned.”\
\
Josh demonstrated his sweet Whippet moves and after a recommendation for a pint session we were soon off the mountain.  The guys continued to head up hunting for powder patches.  We meandered through the woods past small packs of snowshoers who’d ask us, “Is there much more to see up that a ways?”  We’d point to Red Mountain, but it was already obscure behind the mists and clouds.  Made it down to the car before 2:00, just as the rains started to spittle.  Sunshine, views, snow, good company… in all a pretty nice little Saturday up in the mountains.\

"Whitehorse-mountain","A Helicopterless Ascent of Whitehorse - 2-3-07","Let's face it, this mountain has been generally bad news for the UWCC.\
\
-March 2004: Aaron, Jim, John, and myself try via Snow Gulch. We try to climb 40 degree pine duff and eventually turn around at 4700' due to time. And we're all molested by slide alder on the way down.\
\
-March 2005: John and Ben try again via Snow Gulch. While coming tantalizingly close to the summit, the attempt does deserve a second asterisk for use of a helicopter on the descent.\
\
-January 2007: Mike, Nick, and Rok attempt the peak via Lone Tree Pass with hopes of skiing the Whitehorse Glacier. Snow conditions for ascending and skiing are found to be somewhat less than ideal (unless postholing sounds fun).\
\
So any trip involving Jim, Dallas, Obadiah, and myself trying to climb Whitehorse via Snow Gulch that starts and ends with us blundering around in the dark on logging roads couldn't have gone well, right? Ha, you'd be wrong. \
\
Dallas successfully navigated the Mine Road as far as any car could manage to drive before being blocked by a large, downed tree. The road is in poor condition and higher clearance is necessary in places due to washout ruts.\
\
Making a group decision that snowshoes wouldn't be helpful (correct!), we set off around 6:20, managed to take the wrong fork of the logging road in the dark and ended up wandering aimlessly in some snowy woods wishing that each flat patch of ground might be a continuation of the road. Eventually, the mistake was rectified and we located the correct spur and were soon hiking up gravel bars to the base of Snow Gulch - which had a notable lack of snow. Given John's report that a snowless Snow Gulch consists of a series of wet slot canyons and devils club, we chose instead to bushwhack up to the left of gulch through wet slide alder and devils club. Fortunately, this soon gave way to very compact, slick snow and we had great fun chopping steps before deciding that crampons might be a better approach.\
\
In spite of ourselves, we managed to make very good time and soon crossed into the upper Snow Gulch basin at 2500'. From here, the route is actually rather boring. It goes up. Pick the mellowest terrain possible and ascend. (Actually, the entire route could be summed up as, \""Locate Snow Gulch. Ascend until you can go no higher.\"" detailed beta, detailed shmeta)  We roped up at the bottom of the Whitehorse glacier and ascended the relatively terrain. As we climbed, we all noted that the clouds to the north seemed to be getting darker and lower, but decided this was not really relevant to our own efforts. Dallas led a particularly \""interesting\"" crevasse crossing that transitioned to the snow equivalent of choss in fine style. Reaching the 6000' level, we had our first look at the summit block, waved to another pair of climbers chilling at High Pass, and noted a swiftly oncoming front of angry grey clouds intent on terrorizing the town of Darrington. \
\
The final bit up to the summit block turned out to be a bit more sporty than it appeared from a distance and I nearly ended up being stymied on my second Whitehorse attempt by a measly ten feet of snow, rock, and rime. Jim, Dallas, and Obadiah had no such problems, but I ended up resorting to bare-handed ice climbing techniques, despite Dallas' suggestion to \""Use the crampons, not your knee! Use the tool, dude!\"" After all this, the folks on the summit were quite cold and we headed down after an abbreviated round of \""name that peak\"". \
\
At this point, Whitehorse decided that it was making things too easy on us and reduced visibility to about 100 feet, while adding moderate snow and wind. Wandering around on the upper glacier, things looked to be heading for an unplanned bivy when the clouds broke enough for us to get our bearings and down we went. Descent of the snow was relatively uneventful, though Dallas did find his first honest-to-goodness crevasse and the mountain opted to chuck a few ice bombs at us after I did a few lines of Celebrity Jeopardy (apparently, not everyone's a fan). Fading daylight found us about 500' above the gravel bars of Snow Gulch and so, after stowing crampons, pulling out headlamps, and mentally fortifying ourselves, we proceeded to bushwhack through sopping wet brush and alder. As they say, any bushwhack you walk away from couldn't have been that awful, and we all managed to reach the river and locate the logging road on the other side. First time in a while I've both departed and returned to a car by the light of a headlamp.\
\
Good times were, of course, had by all. Seriously.\
\
The route is currently in pretty good condition. Will be substantially easier once Snow Gulch fills with avy debris. While the snow on the upper mountain consisted of breakable crust which was a pain on the ascent, it was nice to be able to plunge step on the way down. We also saw ski tracks <!-- s:shock: --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif\"" alt=\"":shock:\"" title=\""Shocked\"" /><!-- s:shock: --> on the lower slopes.\
\
I took a grand total of about five pictures the whole day - none of them very good. Obadiah?"
"Mount-teneriffe","Mt Teneriffe snowshoe","Went snowshoeing on Mt Teneriffe, over my North Bend. The trailhead is just a mile farther down the road from the Mount Si trailhead, yet there is never anybody parked at Teneriffe. The first six miles of the route is a pretty straightforward logging road that gains about 4000 feet in long, steep, mind-numbing switchbacks. The snow was patchy for the first mile or so, but pretty soon there was enough to strap on snowshoes and keep heading up. This first part isn't particularly scenic, running through second-growth forest and not affording too many views, but when covered in snow its kind of nice. \
\
Eventually I got to a ridge at about 5 miles, that had views of the Haystack poking out of the fog.\

\
At this point the road flattens out and skirts through some nice meadowy terrain, then gets steep for one last time and dead ends at a saddle at 6 miles that looks down into the North Fork Snoqualimie Valley. Views would be good, but in the fog they were pretty limited.\

I had enjoyed a quick snack, finding company with a small group of gray jays. This one provided a nice photo opportunity, and then shit on my trekking pole.\

\
From the saddle, the fun part begins. There is a rough climbers trail to the Teneriffe summit in summer, but in the winter you just have to wing it. I climbed up a small forested gully to a ridge, and proceeded to bushwack to the top of the small mountain that comes before the actual Teneriffe summit. There was zero visibility in the thick fog, so I ended up dead ending at a couple steep cliff faces until I decided to actually take out my compass and map and figure out where the hell I was. I got back on route, descended the small mountain and started making the final climb to the top of Teneriffe. I think the best route is on the North side of the ridge, but I took a more direct path, and ended up climbing some extremely steep slopes to the top. The last part was unexpectedly spicy, my snowshoes couldn't get traction and my axe was just raking through powder, so I hoisted myself up with a couple iced over saplings and found myself at the surprisingly small, knife edge summit. \
\
The summit is hugely exposed to the east, where there was maybe a five foot cornice looming over the edge. It feels very isolated and alpine, considering that the trail starts amongst houses in North Bend. The views were initially dissapointing.\

Total trip is 14 miles, 4400 feet elevation gain. I left the trailhead at 11 AM and got back around 5:30. Twas a fun trip with zero avalanche exposure, except at the summit cornice. Would be great for conditioning."
"snow-creek-wall","Northern Dihedrals Direct, Snow Creek Wall","The stars somehow aligned, and I managed to dodge work, illness, etc., to get out for a day of climbing on Saturday, which I hadn't really done in what feels like four months.\
\
Wayne Wallace ropegunned me up Snow Creek Wall via the Northern Dihedrals Direct, to the left of White Slabs.  He suggested that the route was IV WI5 M6, and I couldn't disagree, as it felt MFH to me.  A few reticent hardmen had climbed parts of the route before, and it's possible Wayne was the first to link it all together.\

"Humpback-mountain","Humpback Mountain, 2/11/07","Aaron Hossack and myself headed up Humpback Moutain this morning, off of exit 47 on I-90. Hansen creek road looked sketchy and icy, so we parked at the turn around right off the freeway and headed up the road. After perhaps two or three miles of road we reached an intersection with the NW ridge and crashed up into the brush in foggy, lightly raining conditions. After a festive schwack through sopping wet trees and undebrush, we found the flagged ridge route and headed towards the summit. The snow for the first 2000 feet or so of the climb was dirty, crusty, melting, and full of weak bridges and tree wells.\

We eventually popped up onto the high point of the ridge, only to realize that we would have to pick our way down the far side of the ridge to get to more friednly ski terrain. Had a snack at a reasonable dropping-in point above the large open slope facing Hwy 2. The snow was wet and heavy because of the potent sun rays, basically like spring skiing. We did a couple laps on that slope before traversing south back to the radio tower and skiing back to the car. Stopped at the Sultan Bakery on the way home. Here are some photos to tide you over until Ethan posts his: <!-- w --><a class=\""postlink\"" href=\""http://www.astro.washington.edu/cowan/outdoors/2007/heather_ridge\"">www.astro.washington.edu/cowan/outdoors ... ther_ridge</a><!-- w -->"
"Church-mountain","Church Mountain 2/17/07","On Saturday, my brother and I headed up Church Mountain, north of the Mt Baker Highway. The road to the trailhead is washed out about halfway up, so we parked our car at the washout and started walking. After a mile or two we reached the trailhead, and enjoyed some mind-numbing switchbacks through almost-completely snow-free forest. We eventually got into some crusty dirty snow, and after about 2500 feet broke into some gorgeous open meadows. Views were incredible, Baker and Shuksan were just a stones away. \

\
We strapped on snowshoes and started a long and hugely enjoyable traverse through the meadows, gaining another 1000 or so feet of elevation. This part was amazing, with constant views of Baker and mountains to the south, and really fun kick-stepping and traversing. Absolutely gorgeous. \

\
At this point we gained the final summit ridge, and started up. Unfortunately, we stopped just short of the summit- I had underestimated how spicy and exposed it would be, and my brother was too sketched out to go any further. It looked completely doable and really fun, but was not ideal for a first-time snowshoe mountaineer. The wind had also become pretty intense and was blowing lots of ice and snow into our faces, so we took shelter on the ridge, has lunch, and headed back down. From the ridge, views opened to the east and to the west, but I was dissapointed to miss views into the Great White North. Twas a nice day in the mountains nonetheless.\
\
Anybody know what mountains these are? I think Tomyhoi is the one on the far left, but I'm probably wrong.\

,"Heather Lake 2/19/07","Rok and i picked up Claudius and drove up to Mt Pilchuk road. Sadly, although we'd spent hours studying weather and avalanche conditions, we failed to realize that the road up to Pilchuk was gated at mile 1. We therefore did not get the early morning turns we had been anticipating. Instead we spent a couple hours hiking up to Heather Lake.

"Silver-peak","Silver Peak Attempt 3/4/07","A band of undergrad UWCCers that consisted of Nathan Snyder, David Johnsrud, Aaron Hossack, and myself went up Silver Peak today. We followed a track up Annette Lake trail until it petered out at a gully, and then decided to charge straight up the flank of the moutain to gain the ridge. We took turns breaking trail up the never-ending slope, which was quite possible the most hellacious trail breaking I've ever experienced. The snow was super wet, fresh, and deep, and even in snowshoes we were postholing about two feet with each step. \
\
Eventually we made it into a purdy open basin that I was not expecting, where we wandered around for a bit trying to figure out where we were. I showed off my superior routefinding skills (\""hold on, so how do you use a compass?\"") and we ended up backtracking and getting on the right ridge. I think we were just a bit west of Windy Pass.\
\
The ridge made for some extremely enjoyable climbing, despite the ridiculous wind. The first sketchy avalanchy part that had turned me back in the past looked good, so we went forward and had a great time clamboring around on the ridge. Lots of fun routefinding through some huge cornices and exposed rock. We decided to turn back short of the actual summit however, when our time and energy had run out. There were nice views down to Annette Lake and to the Alpine Lakes peaks to the north, although the summit of Silver itself was in a seemingly perpetual white-out. We also got to watch some dudes snowboarding down the bowl, which seemed a little scary to me considering the rapidly melting surface snow.\
\
Crotch-deep plunge stepping and some freestyle glissading/rolling got us back down to the trailhead with plenty of time to spare before dark.\
\
Good good times were had by all. Since I forgot my camera I will leave the photographic evidence to Mr. Snyder."
"index","Index","Some friends (Megan, Bryan) and I headed out to Index on Saturday to enjoy some beautiful weather, break in some new trad gear, and investigate Index's allegedly steep gradings. We climbed 3pitches of Great Northern Slab (5.6, *** with a super beautiful second crack pitch), had lunch on top, and had a bit much company (we encountered 7 other people in three parties on the climb, but it was never crowded). We then went over climbed Roger's Corner (5.9, *) which has a super fun second pitch (with super fun small roof) and then continued on up to climb Breakfast of Champions (5.10a, ***, a beautiful hand crack that starts ever so slightly overhung) as a third pitch. All in all two good climbs and a great day. 

Anyone have any more recommendations in a similar vein for Index?

Also: the routes are conveniently and nicely laid out in this online guide: <!-- m --><a class=\""postlink\"" href=\""http://www.stanford.edu/~clint/index/gnslab.gif\"">http://www.stanford.edu/~clint/index/gnslab.gif</a><!-- m -->

Update (6/14): 
-Tatoosh (10a) is worthwhile (despite a rather cruxy start)

,"Mount Baldy and Domerie Peak-3/17/2007","Short version: A group of NW Hikers, expatriate Mountaineers and emeritus UWCC’es headed east of Snoqualmie Pass to escape the rains and get in one last (technically) winter snowshoe outing. \
\
Long version:  Saturday morning found 11 of us (Aaron Zabriskie, Ben Glenn, Justus, Carla, Gabriel, the NW hiker gang of Eric, Randy, Mark, Don and Janet) meeting at the Eastgate Albertsons.  Our Subaru caravan headed over the pass past Lake Keechelus to Easton (Exit 70).  Turning down the DNR/USFS road we encountered snow and saw a car parked a few 100 yards down the way.  Trying to shave off our road travel time, we gamely headed along to where we thought others might have parked.  Driving toward the car we soon began to think it looked more like a stuck abandoned vehicle as opposed to the car of fellow hikers.  As we drove past the Chevy Cavalier, two guys who had been sleeping in the car woke up and got out.  Apparently they had been out the night before and had gotten stuck in the snow sometime around 2:00 am.   <!-- s:? --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_confused.gif\"" alt=\"":?\"" title=\""Confused\"" /><!-- s:? -->  With plenty of shovels and ice axes to spare, our “motorpool” had the car excavated and back to solid asphalt in 45 minutes.  The two gentlemen seemed taken aback and grateful for the help and likely would have offered us a Budweiser for our services had we been up for beers that morning.  \
\
Soon enough (8:30ish) we were walking down the snowpacked road, from which we veered northeast under powerlines and then crossed through a shelterwood to the trailheads for Kachess Ridge and Easton Ridge.  We headed in the general direction of the Easton Ridge Trail, crossed Silver Creek and donned our snowshoes for a mixed tromp through understory (no snow) to a recent harvest unit (deep soft snow).  After about a half-mile of upward snowshoeing that involved negotiating paths amid stumps, young Douglas-firs and slash piles, we made it to the general fork in the trail between Easton Ridge and the trail to Baldy.  With so many people-all on one trip-who are generally used to making the route decisions, there seemed to be a debate about which way to go.  Eventually Aaron and Gabriel started plowing up to the forested tree line and we were soon removing our snowshoes and heading up to a bench that borders the City of Roslyn watershed.  Carla, the bold outlaw amongst us, even dared to lay a boot track or two just past the boundary makers.  On top of the bench we had views of Lake Kachess and the checkerboard forests under USFS management and private ownerships.  (Note: If anyone is in the market, you too can pick up 80 acres of 2nd generation forest at the base of a mountain for a steal of a deal at $400,000.)  \
\
Proceeding up through the western hemlock and Douglas-fir forest there were a few trees approaching old-growth stature.  Amid the gaps, we began to have views to the east of bright blue skies and the Teanaway hills.  After a cookie break and a chance for everyone to unpack their sunglasses, we headed up to the true fir zone and the ridge that trends southeast to Mount Baldy or northwest to Thomas Mountain.  We headed southeast at the junction.  \
\
Gusty winds greeted us on the generous summit of Mount Baldy (5197”).  Making for a chilly lunch spot, but one that provided us with uninhibited views to the north and east of the Stuart Range, Daniel, Hinman, and Cle Elum Lake.  To the south, the top of Rainier would occasionally come out of the clouds.  And to the west, were dark gray rain clouds looming near Snoqualmie Pass.  Following the lead of the avid peak baggers, the summit lounger types joined in for a short stroll over to Domerie Peak (4771’).  The smaller local maximum had equally lovely views. \
\
The return trip followed our ascent route and involved much boot skiing, glissading and post-holing down the forested slopes.  At Silver Creek, we all opted to once again put on our snowshoes, which made the trekking through the now, warm soft snow of the shelterwood and the powerlines smooth sailing.  It had started to spit a bit as we arrived at the creek, but we made it back to the cars just as the real rains started to fall (5:00ish).  \

Miles: 9ish\
Elevation gained: around 3,200 feet\

"Snowking-mountain","5/15 Snowking Mt attempt","Quick TR.
Got all the way up Cascade River Road, to the turn of to the TH. Drove another 1 mile. Parked ~4 miles away from the TH, because washouts were impassable by car. Brought bikes to make the trip 'easier'. Too many washouts made it not wortwhile, so we hiked 3 miles to the trailhead. 
Found a climber path, and weaved our way up a ridge, kind of following tape. Consistant snow at 4k feet, skinnable. Got all the way up to a view of Snowking (its gorgeous). It was 1pm. Decided it was too far away(3 miles) and snow was scary. Sat around and some 15 minutes later a huge avy came down on a similar aspect to what we had initially considered climbing.

Its a glorious peak that I want to try again."
"leavenworth-area-climbs","Leavenworth Cragging","Mike S and I went out to Leavenworth for some Spring climbing in the sun.  It was warm and sunny all day (despite a bit of a breeze).  There were definately ticks around, but didn't bite into Mike or myself.\
We went to Duty Dome (just uphill from Icicle buttress) and climbed a 4-pitch route called Heart or Gold.  The route was mostly bolts, but was supplemented by gear ehre and there.  The route was consistenly 5.10- except for pitch 2 which was probly 5.8-9.  Pitch 3 was the money pitch with sustained friction tiptoeing and a few rests.  Mike lead this in good style and while following i began to wish I had brought something more substantial than my anasazi mocs.  I lead the last pitch which had some interesting sequency moves.\
From the top of Duty Dome, we crosse a small gulley to the base of Warrior Dome and climbed Prime Rib (3p, 5.10b).  Mike got the 1st which went up a wet hand crack/chimney to some contrived face moves protected by bolts higher up (the crack/chimney continues to the same spot as the face moves, but the bolts force you onto the slab just to the right).  I got the crux pitch on this one which goes up a few layback/stem moves to a ledge, then the business begins.  a bolt protects the moves gaining the slab, then a few moves on imaginary feet with shallow pockets (think 1-2 finers and sloping away in all directions) to the left allows you to grab the arrete.  I fell here with my excuse being that i was teaking my shoulder, but the reality is that i suck.  I lowered down a bit and did all the moves to the top.  Definately the hardest moves we had done all day, but the climbing eased up near the top, so not quite as sustained as p.3 on Heart of Gold.  Mike got the last pitch and cruised up it.  As I followed I thought some of the moves were a still a little challenging and my feet were stoked to be at the top.  This was a great link-up of routes for 7 pitches of fun slab!  Highly reccomended.\
We finished the day with a tick check and a jaunt up Midway.  I lead the 5.8+ start and Mike went from Jello Tower to the top.  Very fun route (I have only done Saber on Castle rock before which I didn't like all that much).\
All in all a great day.  I am happy to slowly start climbing again and it was awesome to get back out on granite (as opposed to Vantage's basalt or Smith's tuff)."
"Baring-mountain","Mt. Baring Crapfest","Nathan Snyder, Aaron Hossack and myself made a rainy day attempt at Mt. Baring today. There was virtually no visibility all day, with rain that switched to snow higher up. The climbers trail up to the ridge was muddy and viciously steep, definitely deserves its bad reputation. Snow started about 2/3 of the way up the slope, which we kicked steps into to gain the ridge. The snow here is very icy (solid ice in places) and was a pain in the ass to get up without crampons. We got off a little off route here and ended up doing some super sketchy dirt climbing to get around a huge log across the gully. \
\
The trail on the ridge is a cakewalk for awhile, but then comes to a big cliffy rocky bit that the Smoot book says to traverse below. I however was confused by other beta and for some reason mistakenly thought there was a better route straight through the rocks. So we basically spent a solid hour and a half dicking around in the rocks trying to find a way through, which turned out to be nonexistant. Finally, we decided to backtrack and drop back down to try the steep traverse around the rocks. This is where we eventually decided to turn back, because the snow was so icy. We had crampons but the snow was patchy enough that we would have to constantly take them off and put them back on to get through safely. We were exhausted and soaked from previous shenanigans and the the fog had not lifted at all, so we said fuck it and went back. \
\
The descent from the ridge to trailhead was probably the scariest part of the whole trip. We put on crampons for the snow gully which made things much easier, but the steep wet trail was awful on the way down. I fell multiple times and succeeded in tearing a hole in my rain pants and coating much of my body in mud. There was also some really scary, unexpectly loose rock in the streambed/trail- a grapefruit sized bruise is already starting to form on my right ass cheek from one rock that came flying down from above. This trail might be okay if it was dry but today it was muddy and took forever to descend. \
\
The sun broke through right as we reached the old logging road, and gave us some nice views of Merchant Peak, which is next on my list. Looks really cool. We even got a glimpse of Baring. This route seems like it could be a lot better if there was either more, softer snow or much less, but the current conditions sucked. I want to go back in May/June when the trail to the basin is snow free (and hopefully dry!) but the final parts of the climb still have snow. I have no pictures of note from the trip- just imagine some wet kids on dirty snow in a foggy forest, that pretty much sums up the whole thing."
,"Teebone Ridge Whiteout 4-1-07","There are some trips where you don't get where you wanted to go because you weren't technically/mentally capable of covering it.\
\
There are some trips where you don't get where you wanted to go because you were physically exhausted.\
\
Then there are trips like the one today where you feel mentally and physically with it, but can't actually see where you're going which makes it pretty hard to reach any sort of a destination.\
\
Boyd, Jim, Charles and I tried to climb Little Devil Peak on Sunday. Despite the general lack of anything resembling a view or vista, I can imagine that the area would be very scenic without clouds and blowing snow. At least there wasn't any rain.\
\
We departed from the Monogram Lake TH on Cascade River Road around 7 am and made very good time to the snowline around 3600'. Lots of switchbacks, but they go quickly. From here, we followed skin tracks and snow cairns up through the forest (encountering a friendly skiier along the way) and reached the basin just west of Monogram Lake. At this point, unfortunately, conditions started to deteriorate (as forecasted). Using brief gaps in the clouds to confirm our bearings, we made it up on to Teebone Ridge and as far as the east side of Pt. 6844 before we could go no further. Boyd and I descended the only slope we could see only to find it ended at a thin rocky ridge that projected over a bottomless abyss. It's kind of hard to navigate in a situation where a \""death cornice\"" and gentle slope have the same contrast.\
\
Retraced our route using GPS and good sense and booted up to Pt 6709 where there were actually some sun breaks and good views of Monogram Lake. Teebone ridge never came out of the clouds. We all enjoined a spectacular 1200' glissade back down the ridge - during which each of us had to stop and whipe snow spray off our faces so we could actually see again. Back to the car around 4:15.\
\
Wished we could have gotten up Little Devil, but such is life. Good times had by all.\

"leavenworth-area-climbs","UWCC Alumni Association at Leavenworth","Obadiah and I opted out of the impending Polagye whiteout trip and chose to hit up Leavenworth last weekend.  Saturday morning we rolled up to Castle Rock under gloomy skies and threw down Saber in front of a quad of mounties.  Obadiah led the 5.8 variation of the first pitch and I took the 2nd lead, stopping at some anchors short of the summit, and Obi finished up the scramble off.  \
We were feeling good so we decided to head up Canary.  I led the stern but fair first pitch and neither of us were too gung ho on the send pitch so we finished it on Saber again.  When Obadiah reached the belay he informed me that DP and JStern were in the hood.\
\
We walked off, had a sloppy reunion with those guys and gave DP a peanut gallery for his Canary lead.  Then we made our way over to Midway.  The first pitch failed to sway my opinion of chimneys and Obadiah led the second pitch.  Back at the car we had a safety soda with DaveO and Ryan while we waited for the old farts to do finger surgery and rappel.\
\
Current UWCCers AJ and Reed (? sorry fellas, things were sorta hazy) needed an electronic boost for their performance climbing transport and all 8 of us ended up deciding to storm 8mile campground.  We had one hell of a good beer port burrito ax-in-the-woods tastleless jokes sleep in the dirt good time.\
\
Sunday morning Dave and Ryan headed off for breakfast and supposedly 11 pitched of climbing.  AJ and Reed drove off into the sunrise.  Obadiah and I bombed up classic crack and then headed for Groundhog's Day (3p, 5.7).  I thought it was more fun than Midway or Saber.  It had some good alpinesque, lichen covered, runout climbing.  It was more interesting than I expected.  \
\
Next we went to Retarded Rock and because we were retarded we got lost.  About a sweaty hour later, we ran into the Stern/Perrakis expedition in the midst of a demonstration on how to make thorough and dramatic rappels.  They informed us that we were retarded and still were at the wrong place.  They pointed us away from their hardcore slab climbs and in the right direction.  Obi led Seven Seas which finished in a velcro, albeit painful, hand crack and we called it a day. \
\
A stop at the Alpen Drive in wrapped up one durned fun weekend.  Thanks all."
,"Sahale Arm ski attempt 05.16-17.2009","Sylvain, Valerie, Nathan, Haley and I attempted to ski (Haley was on snowshoes) the arm (south ridge) of Sahale Peak this past weekend. We parked in the Eldorado parking lot, where the road is gated, three miles from the sahale trailhead. There are at least two massive slides that have deposited large amounts of wood and rock debris on the road, spanning at least 100 yards. They are easily passible on foot, but probably won't be repaired this year.

We walked about 2 miles up the road to snow and started skinning. Some steep snow slopes got us up to Cascade Pass, where we witness throughout the day continual avalanches coming off Johannesburg, Cascade Peak, and The Triplets. Great views of Eldorado, Torment, Forbidden and many more. We next started up a steep snow slope above the pass (5400 ft), reaching around 6k feet, right before the arm angle mellows out, when we triggered a large slab avalanche that broke right below Sylvain. He rode it down 20-30 feet till he stopped, and the rest of us were fortunately clear of the slide. We elected to turn around and camped at the pass for the night, enjoying the views. 

Sunday morning we skied down and reached the car by 1130 or so. I've written a more detailed TR with photos, located [url=http&#58;//www&#46;evagabond&#46;info/2009/05/sahale-arm-attempt&#46;html:2nfpa9er]here[/url:2nfpa9er]. There's a video I took of a big avalanche that lasted for over four minutes right as we reached the road again on the way down. The quality is rather low, but you get the idea. 

Question: Is it Sahale Peak or Sahale Mountain? I've seen Peak in most books, but is says Mountain on Google Maps."
"index","Playday at Index","on Sat I went to Index with mike hopp, josh w and his lady-friend Ai.  Mike and I started out on the lizard.  i did the whole thing in 1 pitch with only QDs to control rope drag.  this was not a good idea as i ended up doing what felt like squats with 100lbs for each step up on the last 15' (which is how far down my last piece was.  i then tore my fingers open just hauling the rope.  all that being said, i had a blast in the butt-lips chimney!  mike and i then went and did rodger's corner an di lead breakfast of champions.  i hadnt done it before and took a hang from being so pumped, but was overall happy to be able to scrape up it as i get back into climbing.  while waiting for josh and ai, we did a quick run up libra crack.  i could hear scott w at the base snickering about how much gear i plugged into those 15'.\
overall a fun day out there, but i feel pretty worked from the chimney."
,"Heather (Skyline) Ridge: April 7","Fifteen of us (Aldo, Ben, Dan, Daryl, Eric, Heather, Kris, Kyle, Ian, Jonathan, Matt, Michele, Nathan, Rok, and myself) met up at the 65th St Park & Ride early Saturday morning for a beginner-friendly backcountry ski tour.  We drove up to Stevens Pass and skinned up for a bit before stopping to practise beacon searches and chat about avalanches.  We had lunch on the ridge then enjoyed some runs in the slushy snow.  Despite the numerous poor souls using rentals, everyone seemed to make out OK, although skinning in such soft snow is heinous.  A few of us stopped for pizza on the way home.  \

"leavenworth-area-climbs","UWCC Alumni Association at Leavenworth, Round 2!","Dallas, Steph, Margie and I headed back out to Leavenworth last weekend, and  I have to say it was one of the best Easter weekends I can remember. We met up with a whole crowd of current and former UWCC'ers in 8-mile camp on Saturday night, and did our best to make sure no one in the area got to sleep before midnight. There was even talk of organizing an easterbeer hunt for Sunday morning. <!-- s:D --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_biggrin.gif\"" alt=\"":D\"" title=\""Very Happy\"" /><!-- s:D -->  The only damper was that between the four of us we probably picked 10-12 ticks off ourselves over the course of the weekend. Ugh.\

We spent the first day at Pearly Gates, and the second at Bathtub Dome, both of which were good choices. We had both crags completely to ourselves all day, unless you count an over-curious mountain goat at Pearly Gates!\

Yet again, an awesome weekend out!"
"snow-creek-wall","Outer Space 4/9","I had a Sunday-Monday-Tuesday weekend this week so my buddy Ben and I decided to get out into the alpine a bit. The original plan had been to climb the Whitehorse Glacier on Whitehorse, but with the way the weather turned over the weekend we decided to head to the east side and check out Yellowjacket Tower. Once we got to Leavenworth though the weather turned out to be absolutely beautiful and when we drove past the snow creek parking lot it was entirely empty. We continued on to give Yellowjacket a cursory check from the road and then hauled ass back to snow creek, feeling obligated to climb Outer Space on such a fine day with the entire wall to ourselves.\
\
After a bit of gear sorting and the hike in we finally got started on the route around 10:30. Ben lead the first long simul pitch to two tree ledge. Having climbed the route a couple times already he gave me the sharp end for the traverse pitch which I thoroughly enjoyed, got a little sketched moving past the flaring hand crack but kept finding feet where I needed them and without much more ado made it to the belay. Ben followed the pitch quickly and lead through to the pedestal. After a quick water break we reracked and I took off up to library ledge. After following in our lightweight belay jacket Ben was still pretty cold and I was climbing well so I got to lead the entire crack. This last pitch definitely went the fastest, even stretching the ropes to a full 60m to reach the horizontal crack a bit above the last section of chicken heads where I was greeted by a friendly mountain goat. Ben followed again in the belay jacket and was quickly warmed up by the sun upon reaching the top.\
\
We hung around with Mr. Goat for about half an hour, ate some cheese and then headed down the walkoff. Almost the entire thing was covered in windfall and slippery pine needles so we took our time and finally made it back down to the base of the wall in about an hour and a half without having to break out the ropes for any rappels, although that might've been quicker. We packed up and headed back down to the car after finding the biner I had dropped from two tree ledge in the snow.\
\
After some quick food at the Subway we headed on back across the pass where we were greeted by the weather that had made us call off our climb on Whitehorse. This proved to be the true crux of the trip, which involved almost an hour of crazy windblown snow, 30-40 foot visibility and driving by brail on the rumble strips at 20 mph.\
\
All in all we had an awesome trip, which was my first to Snow Creek wall and I can't wait to get on more granite this summer.\
\
Relaxed at the belay after the crux traverse pitch\

We stopped for scones at the general store in Mazama and headed to the base of the climb.  We geared up at the car before starting up the talus/scree field to reach the base of the route.  I started up and we proceeded to swing leads for the rest of the day completing 10 of the 11 pitches before we headed down.  The climbing was occasionally challenging, but never difficult.  Mostly it was just fun climbing, the kind where you feel like you can just keep moving.  After 10 pitches, we started rappelling and two hours later we were at the base.  We then headed back to Seattle after stopping at the Drive In in Marblemount (thank goodness they were still open - we were both hungry).

"Snoqualmie-mountain","Mt. Snoqualmie Slot Couloir","Nick and I wanted to do something exciting this weekend, and originally got really excited about going to Eldorado or something similar... however, our planning started at noon on saturday over coffee, so we opted for a less committing, but still adrenaline-pumping line. We've seen lots of trip reports and photos of this PNW classic, so we were stoked! \
\
Our planning was pretty careful... we thought maybe too careful, but the avy reports were warning over and over about wet slabs coming off south-facing slopes despite the cool temperatures. So, instead of going up the usual south side of snoqualmie, we opted for a scenic route around past snow lake. Neither of us had done many descents like this before, so we thought it was a good idea to go up the couloir in case there were any particularly hairy spots. The couloir is north-facing, so we expected some powdery goodness on top of a breakable rain crust...\
\
The hike in was awesome, views of Chair etc... and dropping in to the basin below the north side of snoqualmie is quite majestic. We booted up the slot and were very excited to see that our estimates of what conditions we would encounter were pretty much dead-on. At the top, to our dissappointment, we met two more skiers who were just getting ready to descend... so we didn't end up getting first tracks. We were both fairly nervous about the descent, but it went without a hitch (I only had to excercise my self-arrest skills once...) -- our planks broke through the few inches of powder easily and sometimes scraped on the crust so it was a bit technical nevertheless, not to mention the frozen chunks of avy debris hiding underneath the luscious powder on a 45-degree slope (yikes). \
\
We booted up half-way the slot again for a second run on the lower section that had slightly more consistent snow, and then debated whether we should return via our approach or descend the south side of the mountain... unknown territory and reports of cliffs above the lot convinced us to go via our approach route... which would have been fine had we not tried to cut a shortcut (what else would you do when you're dehydrated and tired...) which forced us to do the most extreme skiing of the day on rotten snow, and ended in some interesting backcountry techniques... On our way out we saw quite a few natural wet releases and were happy with our choice of return route, even if it took a bit longer. \
\
We were both elated to have skied this classic line and treated ourselves to some yummy mexican food in Issaquah...! (I think Nick will post photos soon)."
,"Vantage 4/21","Justin, DJ, and myself headed over to Vantage for the day, and enjoyed some damn fine climbing. Weather was uncharacteristically temperate, cloudy with a little bit o rain here and there. Not enough to make anything sketch though. \
\
Twas my and Justin's first time at Vantage, this place is awesome! I led a series of fun 5.8s, the highlight being the super long and airy Vantage Point on the sunshine wall, with a surprisingly thin, slopey crux near the end. We also got on Satan's Wagon (5.10b) and a 10c on the Feathers, and after some time at Sunshine, headed to the M+M wall. Justin lead a rad 5.11a that starts in a cave, has a stemmy middle section, and ends with some powerful moves over a roof. Forget what it was called. \
\
We've all seen plenty of Vantage pictures but here are a few more:\

,"Rappelling","Sat (4/21), I went rappelling at Snow Creek Wall with my friend Melissa.  Of course there was some climbing that we had to do to get to our high point in order to do the sweet rappels, but in the end it was worth it.  We decided that the first 3 pitches of Orbit would be suitable beause the wandering nature of he route would mean more interesting rappels.  As we got to the top of the 3rd pitch, some menacing clouds that had been pouring down from the Enchantments finally sat above us and a little rain came down to enhance the experience.  Having one of those \""chic\"" 60m ropes,  I was happy to go first on out first rappel which went down over a roof into the abyss.  As it turned out, the \""abyss was a flat ledge with a bolted (circa 70s) station.  The next rappel went down a gully and as we puled the rope, it got caught around a horn, so I had to do some more of that stupid climbing stuff to go up and get it.  2 more raps and we were back at the packs.  We started down the obvious path from the end of our last rappel after packing our things, only to find that we got a bonus rappel!!!!  We hurridly unpacked rope and harnesses and got to the business.  Can you believe it?!?!  Only 3 climbing pitches to score 5 rappels, my lucky day.  It was still raining, so we went to Uncle Ulis to celebrate and finished the day with some Swiftwater bouldering once it dried up a bit.  We did some fun V0-1ish things and goofed around on a V3 next to Royal Flush (which I pumped out on and fell off the last move gaining the slab, closest I've ever been to sending)."
"Mount-higgins","Mt Higgins (lookout) - 4/28/07","Michelle, Darin, Ruth, and I climbed up to the site of the old Mt. Higgins Lookout on Saturday under partly sunny skies. We followed the trail until hitting solid snow around 3700' and then followed some older snowshoe prints up into the meadows below the summit. Here we chose to go to climber's right, which ended up requiring a few sporty bits to get on the ridge, so I would suggest going to climber's left from the meadows, unless you're in it for the sporty bits.\
\
The technical crux was probably crossing Dick Creek.\

Approach notes:\
\
Take C-Post road off Hwy 530 (1.5 hrs drive from Seattle)\
\
The bottom 1.5 miles of the road are currently in use by logging trucks and there is one 100 yard stretch that is particularly muddy and unpleasant. We made it through with a fully loaded Integra with just a few brushes between road and undercarriage, but if it gets more rutted and muddy this will be problematic."
"Mount-ellinor","Mt Ellinor 4/29","Friedrich, Aaron, Nathan, and myself all headed up to Mt Ellinor in the Olympics today. There were a shit ton of people at the trailhead, maybe 15 or 20 cars total, but which I thought was pretty astounding. Didn't know this trail was so popular... either way, we headed up from the lower trailhead and made good time on the mostly snow-free trail to the prominent avy chute that you climb to gain the summit ridge. There were very well kicked steps up the entire chute so it was pretty easy going, even at some pretty steep (maybe 45 degrees) sections. At the ridge there is one last push to the gorgeous summit, where we enjoyed some warm sun and partial but pretty damn wonderful views, mainly west to Mt Olympus and such. We shared the summit with a couple others for maybe twenty minutes, but then a mass of people took over the summit, so we decided to make our way back down after a nice lunch. \
\
The glissades back down were a lot more intense than any of us expected. The first was mellow but cliffy, and then the second one had a great runout but was pretty steep and crazy. Things got a little out of control going down the main chute, which is really quite long... we all had some interesting experiences and probably learned some lessons. I for one realized that I suck at self-arrest, and need some practice. Aaron and Friedrich handled themselves pretty well throughout, while Nathan and I did a little more \""experimental\"" glissading i.e. flipping, going down backwards, plowing through snowbanks, etc.\
\
Regardless, twas a great day in the mountains. Sun, good snow, good company, good times. 3200 feet elevation gain, 6 miles RT.\

"South-early-winters-spire","SEWS - Southwest Rib","Obadiah and I headed up to WA Pass for a little climbing and to check out conditions. We had originally intended to check out Kangaroo Temple and Half Moon, but after seeing Cutthroat, we decided there was too much snow and headed up to South Early Winter Spire (SEWS) instead.  We talked about the SW Rib or the South Arete depending on snow.

We headed up from the Blue Lake Trailhead, where there were tons of cars parked.  The skiers were out in force this weekend enjoying the weather and good snow conditions.  As we snowshoed into the basin, we took lots of photos of the spires.  Kris, the next set of photos is for you.

After looking up at SEWS for quite a while, we decided the SW Rib would probably go.  We made our way to the base of the route.  In the description, Beckey says to go up anywhere on the West Face (5.6-5.<!-- s8) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cool.gif\"" alt=\""8)\"" title=\""Cool\"" /><!-- s8) -->  I led out.  After not being able to look up with my pack on, we consolidated gear into one follower pack and Obadiah tossed mine off the ledge.  Now much lighter, I led up until the rope drag became too much as I fought with a tree.  Obadiah lead the second pitch, which was mostly brush and snow.  It turns out, rock shoes are not so water proof, nor do they have much insulation.

The third pitch featured a wide crack (5.7/5.<!-- s8) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cool.gif\"" alt=\""8)\"" title=\""Cool\"" /><!-- s8) --> that was somewhat awkward and some more tree/snow.  

At this point we were a little disheartened by the quality of the climb.   Fortunately this is where things became much more fun climbing.  The fourth pitch involved some wet low fifth climbing to a slab (5.6+) to a belay ledge above.

[img:29frzcqw]http&#58;//lh4&#46;ggpht&#46;com/_Dr3h22tmokw/ShG7pazdMkI/AAAAAAAAD_A/0BAAuHqx4lY/s400/IMG_2305&#46;JPG[/img:29frzcqw]

The fifth pitch was a fun double crack (5.7+) that required bear hugging.  Obadiah made quick work of it with thigh jams, whereas after the first bear hug moves and stemming, I found face climbing easier with the large pack.  This was definitely the most fun climbing on the route.

From there I kicked steps up some snowy slope (rock shoes do NOT stick to ice).  And then with wet shoes started up the 5.5 slab to a scary looking bolt.  Fortunately, I got a #1 cam in right above it.  There was another runnout slab section above that as well.  I ran out of rope so we simuled for about a half rope length to get to the rabbit ears.

We rappelled into the notch and wallowed through a little more snow to get to the 5.2 crack, which we simuled up.

We arrived at the summit at 7:30 PM after ~5.5 hrs on the route.  We spent long enough to snap photos, eat, and change into mountaineering boots.  My feet were very glad to be in warm and waterproof boots again.

We downclimbed the South Arete, which was way easier than I realized.  We went down in one simul-pitch before doing three rappels to the base of the route.  We reached the base just as we finally needed headlamps (~9:30 PM).  

[img:29frzcqw]http&#58;//lh3&#46;ggpht&#46;com/_Dr3h22tmokw/ShG7rvFPCzI/AAAAAAAAD_8/R_cUPe8vd1w/s400/IMG_2321&#46;JPG[/img:29frzcqw]

About an hour of walking brought us back to the trailhead.  We drove down to find a campsite at Klipchuck Campground.  We quickly made dinner and then were in our bags by midnight.  

This was actually a really fun climb after the first couple of pitches.  I'd like to point out that the trend we started with the NR of Forbidden seems to be continuing as this is summit number two for us.  Still it had all the earmarks of a Obadiah/Jim adventure: a little bit of brushiness, snow on the route, fun climbing, alpine ambiance, return to the trailhead after dark.  Thanks for a fun day in the mountains.

"Mount-stuart","Mt. Stuart - Cascadian Couloir Ski - 4/28-29","Last week, I was sitting inside generally driving myself out of my gourd, day dreaming about being back in the hills. I have this wierd set-up where I only have work/class on Tuesday through Thursday each week, but still have a number of responsabilities. What happens is I come to Tuesaday totally unprepared, squeak through the week, and am busily packing or preparing for another trip by Thurday night. Sounds nice except for the mental health part where I can't think of anything but snow, rock and ice while I try to write a grant for my internship. It's not called an obsession for nothing.\
\
Anyway, I really wanted to go ski Stuart. I was up that way in the middle of April with Mike, Jason and Justin to go for the SGC, but had to come down because of considerable new snow loading above 7500. My friend Nick Webb and I had been consipring to ski Ulrichs after seeing Jason Hummel's TR from earlier in April. After wading through a week of angsty madness, I called Nick and we made a plan to hike in on Saturday and ski on Sunday. I was relieved. Fiinally I had a plan. I was going to ski. The madness appeared to receed.\
\
Saturday, we rallied at a relaxed hour, and another friend, James, decided to come along too. We drove off to find the Beverly Creek trailhead. The North Fork Teanaway road was melted out past the split to Stafford Creek Rd. FS 9703, but we were stoped a couple of miles short of the Beverly Creek turn-off by a snowy bend in the road that is usually the last spot to melt out. This is where all the other cars were parked, so we saddled up our packs, and headed out around noon.\
\
We hiked about three road miles to the trail head, where we ditched approach shoes/my chacos, and doned our \""tools of ignorance\"" (i.e. ski-boots).\
\
He are Nick and James at the TH:\

\
From there we booted for another mile, past Bean Creek, and only then were able to start skinning. From there, we continued up Beverly Creek and over the pass to Turnpike Creek. \
\
Here are Nick and James skining up to the pass in the Saturday sun:\

\
Here is a map (stolen from alpineslider.com) of the route we took:\

\
Once we got to the pass, we were treated to views of Stuart in all its glory:\
[img:3t040in6]http&#58;//lh5&#46;google&#46;com/image/samcrary/Rj0W7x34EEI/AAAAAAAABQc/NIhkKuA6Ohw/s800/P4280038&#46;JPG[/img:3t040in6]\
\
Then we snuck off for a few turns, before traversing high on the east flank of the valley to maintian elevation:\
[img:3t040in6]http&#58;//lh6&#46;google&#46;com/image/samcrary/Rj0WxB34EBI/AAAAAAAABQE/hJNJUBo3irM/s800/P4280035&#46;JPG[/img:3t040in6]\
\
We scouted out our route from here. A view of the cascadian couloir route can be seen on Ian Mackie's site: <!-- m --><a class=\""postlink\"" href=\""http://mackieimages.typepad.com/photos/ski/mtstuartskiroute_2.html\"">http://mackieimages.typepad.com/photos/ ... ute_2.html</a><!-- m -->\
as well as a great view of Ulrich's on the same site here: <!-- m --><a class=\""postlink\"" href=\""http://mackieimages.typepad.com/photos/ski/bwstuart.html\"">http://mackieimages.typepad.com/photos/ ... tuart.html</a><!-- m -->\
\
We were a bit uncertain of how to get into Ulrich's since it is hidden from the Turnpike Creek side, but we decided that we would ski the route we climbed, so that if we wanted to ski Ulrich's (which we did) then we should climb that way to check it out.\
\
After a short slog across Turnpike and Ingals Creek, we came to some slide alder at the base of the skiers right alternate version of the cascadian, just below the summer trail:\
[img:3t040in6]http&#58;//lh4&#46;google&#46;com/image/samcrary/Rj0XCh34EGI/AAAAAAAABQs/xCTVgA_6LcI/s800/P4280040&#46;JPG[/img:3t040in6]\
\
We continued to the base of the Cascadian and found a spot to bivy for the night. We rose around 4am after a resonable mild night and started off. \
\
A view of Ingals in the morning light:\
[img:3t040in6]http&#58;//lh4&#46;google&#46;com/image/samcrary/Rj0XWh34EOI/AAAAAAAABRs/S0llhbv6vwU/s800/P4290048&#46;JPG[/img:3t040in6]\
\
I hadn't really checked to carefully about how to get into Ulrich's, and Nick thought we should head up one of the gullies to the West of the Cascadian, and then cross over higher up. This turned out not to be correct, but we didn't figure this out until quite a bit latter.\
\
Here we are, heading up one of the gullies:\
[img:3t040in6]http&#58;//lh4&#46;google&#46;com/image/samcrary/Rj0Xdh34ERI/AAAAAAAABSE/-yA5Bv-kKE4/s800/P4290051&#46;JPG[/img:3t040in6]\
\
At around 7500 ft. the gully we were heading up started to pinch down into a narrow slot couloir, and though it continued in view for another thousand feet, it grew quite a bit steeper with some small icey/rocky steps. This was not skiing terrain, and we should have known that the route was clearly somewhere else, but unfortunately we decided to venture up that 1000 extra feet before thinking to carefully about it. After reaching the end of the visible couloir, the slot just got even steeper and the snow disappered. We were, in fact, surrounded by 20 ft rock walls on three sides. Off route, and a little dismayed, we downclimbed the couloir to where it opened again. At this point, since we didn't really have a clue where we were headed, James decided that he needed to save some energy for the slog back over the pass, and since we could practically still see camp back down the 3000 ft. couloir we were in, he headed down. \
\
A bit disapointed but not content with giving up, I explored over to the West and came to a vantage where I could see Ulrich's. Unfortunately, there were definately some tricky cliffbands to negotiate that way, and it was getting a little late for that kind of adventure. I came back to where Nick was, reported my findings, and we decided that didn't make sense at the late hour of 8am! But Nick didn't want to just head down either, and decided that someone should look over the east shoulder by climbing a snowy headwall on our right. He headed up and finally reached the top of the ridge. He was to far away to hear anything, but he started gestering wildly, swinging his arms over his head. It turns out he was giving me the tumbs up, as he explained later, but with his ski poles in his hands, it just looked like he was making fists. Eventually I figured it out, and come up that way too.\
\
Eureka! We had found a little side chute that linked the Cascadian with our gully, and from there we could see the upper headwall, shrouded heavily in morning cloud. We headed across and met another party who we ran into the evening before and who had plans for the Cascadian. At this point I talked with Nick, and he decided that he couldn't leave James, since he had invited him on the trip, and he decided to rejoin him at camp. He said that it was okay with him if I kept on going, and we set up an arangement. It was now 9:40 am. I would keep going while they returned to the truck, but I would turn around before 12:15, and if I wasn't back to the truck by 6, they should start to worry. Nick headed off for an improving ski down, and I started up. The other part was having a snack, but I asked them what altitude we were at, and they said just shy of 8k. I figured it couldn't take too long.\
\
Of course, this is what the view up hill looked like in one of the clearer moments:\
[img:3t040in6]http&#58;//lh3&#46;google&#46;com/image/samcrary/Rj0XhR34ETI/AAAAAAAABSU/rxnyvTncaU4/s800/P4290053&#46;JPG[/img:3t040in6]\
\
So for another hour, I cramponed up this bizare whiteout slope, using faintly seen rocks as guides to keep me in the right place. I even tried a new technique. On a break, I took a look a a photo of Stuart on my camera to help me figure out how far along I was. Suprisingly, it worked pretty well. The snow on the upper headwall was a little icy, but it seemed like to would hold an edge, I just kept hoping it would get clearer by the time I was set to ski back down.\
\
More headwall, whiteout vertigo:\
[img:3t040in6]http&#58;//lh6&#46;google&#46;com/image/samcrary/Rj0XjB34EUI/AAAAAAAABSc/TDD7sxP5P0M/s800/P4290054&#46;JPG[/img:3t040in6]\
\
All of a sudden, out of the mists, I could make out the false summit. I stepped up the final steep pitch, and reached the crest. I pondered whether or not to continue to the true summit, and decided to give it a go. It was only 11am, and as the visability slowly improved, and I was able to make out the peak in the distance. I decided to try for it. After carefully making my way across the steep headwall of Ulrich's, I reached to summit.\
\
Here is the cheese-grin to prove it:\
[img:3t040in6]http&#58;//lh3&#46;google&#46;com/image/samcrary/Rj0XmR34EWI/AAAAAAAABSs/rMejWxSpxRo/s800/P4290056&#46;JPG[/img:3t040in6]\
\
A view down the east ridge:\
[img:3t040in6]http&#58;//lh6&#46;google&#46;com/image/samcrary/Rj0XoB34EXI/AAAAAAAABS0/rFmk3RHQEqg/s800/P4290057&#46;JPG[/img:3t040in6]\
\
And back to the false summit:\
[img:3t040in6]http&#58;//lh3&#46;google&#46;com/image/samcrary/Rj0XrR34EZI/AAAAAAAABTE/L2jILuL7ZGk/s800/P4290059&#46;JPG[/img:3t040in6]\
\
From there, it was on with the skis and into some turns. The upper headwall was pretty damn firm and every turn unleashed a \""sluff\"" of little ice pebbles, but it held an edge. After decending 500 ft, and enduirng one more moment of total whiteout nausea, the sun came out to stay and the lower headwall and boulder field yielded perfect corn. It was time to drop the knee and let 'em run! I was able to ski all the way back down to camp (thanks to a little alder hopping in the patchy lower section) and skinined out from there. The slog up to the pass back into Beverly drainage was absolutely exaughsting, and I reached the pass shivering and shaking, nearly having bonked. Rested in the sun, shoved every last bit of food in my mouth and settleed in for the slog out. Around 4:30, I found Nick and James at the truck, enjoying beer and snacks, litesning to tunes where they had only been waiting for an hour or so. We stopped for burgers in Cle Elum, and saw the other party of skier there, who ended up skiing down from where we saw them earlier.\
\
A parting shot of Stuart taken from the pass:\

"Dickerman-mountain","Mt Dickerman- Snow Skills 5/5","I guess I'll get this started, and everybody can throw on their pics and what not... \
\
This Cinco de Mayo a festive group of 11 (Jim, Brian, Obadiah, Mike, Taylor, Friedrich, Matt, Kris, Evan, Nathan, and myself) headed out to Mt Dickerman. The trail was dry for the first 1500 feet or so, and then we got into some fresh powdery snow. Those who had snowshoes charged ahead while the rest of us got to hone our postholing skills. We eventually set up shop at some purdy open slopes below the summit, learned self-arrest on a goopy glissade track, and then broke up into teams and practiced crevasse rescue. \
\
Before heading down we made a quick run to the summit, where we enjoyed great views and sunshine. Brian led an always invigorating round of name-that-peak, while others attempted to locate the 30 foot cornice of doom of which we had heard rumors. \
\
The descent was a bit sloppy due to the sun-warmed snow, but we made good time back to the trailhead around 7 PM. Twas an awesome day in the mountains, everything went perfectly and I think we all learned a lot. Big thanks to Matt, Mike, Jim, and Evan for driving (and to Kris for carting me and Nathan around!). Especially big thanks to everybody who brought gear, and to the advanced folks who took the time to help teach and make this happen. \

,"More Weekend Cragging","I made it to Index on Sat and WW1 on Sun.  Climbed p1 and p2 of Princely to warm up.  The couple of face moves on the 1st pitch were pretty darn wet making 5.9 surprisingly spicy.  I hadn't ever done the 2nd bit and was more hoping to try Dr Sniff, but there was a waterall on the layback bit.  Only the short hand crack was worthwhile on p2 princely, IMO.  Then off to thin fingers which was seeping inside the lower bit making the finger locks suck more than usual.  I then flailed on the short boulder problem but hiked the upper bit.  My friend Melissa wanted to get some more parctice placing gear, so we did GNS, she did the 5.2, then i went up libra and she led to the top, shes getting better at placing good gear quickly,hopefully she'll start ropegunning for me soon <!-- s:) --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_smile.gif\"" alt=\"":)\"" title=\""Smile\"" /><!-- s:) -->.  finished the day with stunning...errr cunning stunt.  i hadnt done it before, it turned out to be a lot of fun!  i highly reccomend it, lots off different climbing styles packed into 1 crag pitch.\
at 32 we warmed up on girls in the gym then did psycho wussy, the bad guy and finally end of the world.  i hung at least once on everything except our warm-up, but it was nice to know i could still do the moves on all of those routes.  melissa took scoot up on an offer to TR bust the move and then went for one more lap on girls in the gym to cool down.  my shoulders were spent after end of the world though, so i called it quits then.\

We bivyed by the highway and got up at 5am for tea and oatmeal.  By 6ish we were slogging our way up the hill on unneccesary snowshoes and I was feeling the altitude and three weeks of sedentary living.  The snow was in pretty good condition so we started with the couloir, which is more impressive in person (though not much).\

All day long we saw kids packing their skis and dogs up Whistler(?) for some fun shralpin.\

\
Down climbing the couloir would have been annoying so we down scrambled and rapelled the south arete.\

\
After a short brunch and sun break, we racked up to take on the south arete, from the ground up this time.  Since we had plenty of time and sunshine and my back hadn't exploded in the couloir, we decided to go ahead and do both climbs.  The route is rated 5.4 so we opted to climb in boots.  The friction moves on the first \""crux\"" felt more like 5.9 with wet boots.  The only other tricky bit was a semi-snowy chimney that Steph led by slinging an in-situ nylon chockstone.  We encountered several other parties employing every technique from soloing and solo down climbing to simul-soloing on a 10 ft rope.  Takes all kinds!\
\
(Notice the position of the rope compared to the postion of the belayer/photographer).  \

\
It was getting pretty warm by the time we rapped off the arete for the second time and we were getting hungry and thirsty.  We packed up (thanks to the guy who freed our stuck rappel line) and began wading around to the base of the couloir to retrieve our snowshoes.  I would say the couloir is probably done for the season (it was getting thin in sections), but the warm temps made for a beautiful day in the hills and some fun glissading!\

\
A good time was had by all on two classics in an awesome setting!  We were wondering why the Cascades are the American Alps.  Screw that, the Alps should be called the Euro Cascades."
"Del-campo-peak","Del Campo 5/13","Headed up to Gothic Basin today with the hopes of climbing Del Campo Peak... we were shut down about 200 feet from the summit, right at the notch that leads to the third class scrambling to the summit. Expecting dry sunny weather, we were intead greeted with continual rain that turned into sleet and snow. There was maybe 2 or 3 inches of fresh snow up there from Saturday night, so my hopes that the rock scramble section of the climb would be dry/snow-free were thwarted. \
\
There was zero visibility pretty much all day, but we managed to find ourselves skirting the rocky cliffs of Del Campo and even found what was almost certainly the right notch that leads to the summit. We decided to turn around though, having run out of time, not wanting to do the exposed third/fourth class step with snow on it, and not liking the fractures and avy debris in the gully to the notch. There was some good snow and glissading to be had on the way down, although at one point my buddy DJ did set off a small but kind of scary slide that kept moving long after he got out of it. \
\
This seems like a nice area but I can't be sure because all we saw all day was white snow and sky. Hoping to go back and try again in June or July on a legitimately nice day when the rock will be dry.\
\
The road to Monte Cristo has suffered a lot of flood damage, and the bridge over the Sauk is washed out, so if anyone was planning to bike into Cadet or Columbia anytime soon, it may be a tad difficult. On the Gothic Basin trail there was also a creek crossing that was too big to do without gettng soaked, so be prepared to either pole vault across or get your feetsies wet. \
\
Has anybody done this peak this time of year?"
,"Enchantments Solo Snowshoe","First let me appologize for the lack of photos.  I forgot my camera.\
\
This weekend I traversed the Enchantments from Snow Creek to Colchuck Lake.  There is a lot of damage to the Snow Creek trail below Nada Lake.  The sign at the trailhead says 142 downed tree, which was dated 4/27.  There are fewer now, but still a lot.  In some places I felt like I was on a jungle gym at a playground.  The snow is patchy until just below Snow Lakes at which point it becomes pretty continuous.  As I headed up from the lakes, I would loose the trail and find it again.  Fortunately the snow was pretty solid and kick steps was not too difficult.\
\
Once I reached reached Lake Vivian, I would punch through to my waist without my snowshoes.  I continued on to Inspiration Lake where I made camp for the night.  As I finished my salmon with cranberry rice dinner, the wind picked up, the clouds rolled in, and it started to snow.  I retreaded to my bivy sack where I listened to the wind howl throughout the night.  When I would periodically look outside, I sometimes saw stars and sometimes couldn't see the lake I was camping next to.\
\
The next morning I was up early and quickly broke camp.  The wind was still strong, but the clouds were high enough to navigate easily.  I made my way across the plataeu towards Aasgard Pass.  The traverse was slow since I would have to stop and lean into the strong gusts of wind to keep from falling over.  The descent from the pass was also slow and I was glad to have brought crampons.  From Colchuck Lake things went more quickly.  I before I new it, I was at the trailhead.  Another hiker offered to give me a ride back to Snow Creek, which I gratefully accepted.\
\
It was an awesome solo adventure and a great weekend in the mountains."
,"Lake Serene","I headed up to Lake Serene on Sunday with Lisa, Brooke, Stefan (my nephew), Holly &amp; Cedar (my dogs).  This was my daughters first hiking trip and it was a beauty.  We left Seattle around 8:30 and made good time up to the trailhead.  

After a quick feeding, we on the trail and were quickly up to Bridal Vail Falls.  We were all very impressed by the waterfalls, although I was not able to admire them as long as I would have liked as it was too cold there for Brooke's liking.  

The trail steps it up from this point till just before the lake.  I was quite impressed with the quality of the trail and numerous stair cases put into the hillside.  Brooke requested a rest break for a drink of milk about 2/3's the way up, but was a quite contented hiker most of the way.  As we got to the first clearings about 1/4mi from the lake with spectacular views of the Index peaks snow became an issue.  Although there was a well established boot path through the snow, after speaking with numerous hikers it was evident that it would not be safe to continue with Brooke any further.  One person said they saw someone post-hole up to their chest!

So we found an nice large dry rock for our party to relax and have lunch on.  Upon opening my pack I suddenly realized that I have left my refrigerated food at home in the fridge.  That makes twice that I have done that this year.  Fortunately, I had over packed granola bars, etc and my nephew shared some of the fruit he had hauled up in his lunch.

I was really surprised how many people there were up on this trail, as we must have seen well over 60 people and ~20 dogs over the course of the day.  I guess I've gotten spoiled going to far more remote locations and not seeing anyone in the backcountry.

After Lisa got her lunch, we were back on our way down the mountain and back to the car.  Dinner was burgers at Lisa's mom's house.

Name that crag: What is that large rock face on the western slopes of Gunn peak, looking north from Index towards the Monte Cristos?

"Silver-peak","Silver Peak 5/13/07","On Sunday, May 13, 2007, Andy and I went to Silver Peak intending to climb it via the N ridge. Driving towards Snoqualmie Pass we were greeted by light showers and fresh snow on the surrounding mountains. At 8:30 we were the first car in the parking lot. Fortunately, the rain had almost stopped when we left. \
We hiked up the Annette Lake trail and very soon hit the first snow. More precisely, we were hit by thawing snow falling from the trees. We tried to figure out when to leave the trail in order to get onto the alternative route mentioned in the 75 scrambles book. However, with the present snow-cover we were very unsure where to leave the trail. Therefore, we followed the trail for some hundred yards after what we thought to be the last switchback. We then headed up some steep snow-covered talus field that we followed almost all the way to the ridge. In the beginning the snow was perfect for kick stepping but higher up there were some areas with pretty hard snow. In addition the slope steepened to an estimated 60 degrees. That is why we decided to put on crampons while we were in a not very comfortable position on the slope. \
We climbed the snow field to its end and were confronted with rocks and trees. Fortunately, Andy discovered a way out and after some near vertical (I exaggerate but it was pretty bad) bush whacking we finally made it to the ridge. Since there were no cornices on the ridge we chose whichever side of the ridge seemed more convenient. Most often there were trees on the West side of the ridge. We scrambled up the ridge and realized that crampons and loose snow-covered boulders are not the best combination. On the ridge there were no views because we were climbing in the clouds. Since we had no idea how far away from the summit we were and because we could not expect to be rewarded by nice views from the summit, we were not disappointed that we didn't summit when we reached our turn-around time at 1:30. We had lunch and then retraced our steps. Because of the significantly softer snow the descent (down-climbing and plunge-stepping/glissading) on the steep snow field went well. The hike back to the parking lot (which we reached at about 6:00) was uneventful. \
On this trip we encountered various different snow conditions from really firm to wind blown knee-deep snow. In general there were about one to four inches of fresh snow on the mountain. On the way down, the snow field we had ascended was covered with big chunks of snow. I assume the wet fresh snow started rolling down the slope while we were climbing the ridge.\
We didn't meet anybody all day which certainly added to the feeling of adventure I experienced on this trip (despite hearing I-90 occasionally).\
Thanks to Andy for this great trip, to Jon for his advice and beta, and to Brian and Mike for their opinions on Baring Mountain (which we originally considered climbing) and the early season avy advice.\

"The-brothers","Wednesaturday on the Brothers 5/16/07","Short Version: On Wednesaturday Carla, Yana, Yoav and I went up the south route of Edward, the southern peak of The Brothers.  \
\
Long Version: After watching a glorious sunset over the Olympics from the Seattle-side of the water, Tuesday night found Yoav and I rolling into Yana and Carla’s roadside camp around 11:30.  We knew it was the right spot, not because of Yana’s car or the REI Half Dome, but because of the bottle of Wild Turkey in the fold-up chair near the tent, cup of sunflower seeds, and the well-crafted arrow on the side of the road pointing to said signs of Carla.  While I was finishing a GIS midterm Tuesday afternoon, Carla and Yana had been kind enough to leave Seattle early to stake a claim on a camp site.  Good thing too, when they arrived at the Lena Creek Campground they found that other campers had already laid claim to spots for the weekend.  The two amused themselves with a very safe round of Frisbee tossing and watching quality films about marionettes that save the world (i.e. Team America).\
\
Having fallen asleep to clear starry skies just a few hours earlier, we awoke to the predicted low clouds and marine layer hanging around 2,000 feet.  Leaving the trailhead around 6:00 am, we started up the gentle switch backing trail to Lower Lena Lake passing through a two-tiered second growth forest of vine maple and Douglas-fir.  At a trail-side camp spot looking over the lake we talked to a camper who said he and his partner had been up to the east peak of the Brother’s complex the day before.  Our map didn’t show any eastern peaks around 6,100 feet in elevation, but perhaps this fellow’s did, since the topography on our maps for the area seemed unfamiliar to him.  After exchanging pleasantries, the four of us were soon on our way around the lake.  Luckily, we had each been given a password to The Brothers Wilderness Area, and were able to cross the boundary into the wilderness without much difficulty.  From this point, the trail was always close by to Lena Creek as it wandered up the Valley of the Silent Men through a stand of old-growth Douglas-fir, western redcedar and western hemlock.  We stopped to admire the plunge pools, piles of large woody debris, and the gravel bars of the creek a few times before we reached the fork of Lena Creek.  \
\
After some debate about the specific directions (i.e. Smoot vs. Mountaineer’s guide vs. Goldman) for the route to get to the base of the Brothers, Yana found the first crumb of flagging just beyond the camp spot at the fork of the creek.  With the trail generously marked with flagging, we were on our way up to the lower base of the avalanche terminus.   (Amusingly enough, the understory Pacific silver fir-nary 8 feet tallbut probably a good 200 years old-were marked with “killer tree” flagging.)  We encountered large patches of snow as we left Lena Creek and wandered up past 3,000 feet into the site of the 2006 fire that burned up a ridge of Alaska yellow cedar and Pacific silver fir.  (Note: This isn’t a stretch of the route that anyone would want to stand around in for too long, given that the burned remains of the trees could topple down easily.)  \
\
Having negotiated the charcoaled logs, we next faced the brush barrier to the gully.  The Sitka alder and devil’s club are just starting to leaf out and haven’t managed to reach their full barrier potential, but they were still a nasty tangle, sufficient to thwart Carla and her pack.  She eventually persevered (take that Alnus sinuata!).  Past the alder barrier, were on snow from 3,500 feet and would be up to the summit block.  \
\
We kicked steps up to the snow-covered meadow (~4,300 feet) we discussed our route options and went with the useful and memorable quote of “Go right, go right, go right, young man!” Thus, we eschewed the hourglass-shaped gully and cluster of trees at its base and directed our kick steps around to a gentle ridge.  As we went in a northeaster direction, could see a cluster of three peaks (Mt. Ellinor complex or the Mt. Bremerton complex?) behind us.  Several cairns in a snow-free patch of the ridge confirmed our path we continued up the top gully through steeper snow.  To the west we had views of mountains and blue skies but to the south and east we saw views of clouds and a marine layer that masked Puget Sound.  Periodically the base of Rainier came out from behind some of the clouds.  \
\
Straight up the snow slope we climbed steadily to the rock formation where we were treated to the loose scree and talus of the Brothers complex that is exposed during the warmer months of the year.  Having gone straight up to the saddle between some of the low points, there was much hemming and hawing about how to get to the summit.  The rock around here felt more like unprotected 4th or low 5th, and so we scoured around for the less sporty summit block approach.  After scrambling around, I was able to look down on the trail and gentle route up to the summit.  We realized we should have followed our mantra for the route and gone right where the snow had ended.  Yana breezed up the class 2/3 scramble route and took a sporty variation to the top of Ed (aka the south peak).  After rounding up Carla and Yoav, we were soon heading up to join Yana on top of the summit block (6,866 feet).  There, we lounged for a bit (Olympic marmot style) humbled by the knife-like ridge traverse to the north peak, admiring the blue skies and mountains to our west and a wall of clouds to the east.  Just as we finished fueling up on white cheddar cheeze-its and milano cookies, the clouds started to wrap around the peak.  We began our descent as the view quickly deteriorated-providing Carla and Yana with familiar views from recent trips.  We scrambled down the summit block and soon we were plunge stepping and glissading through the corn snow down past our upward tracks.  Carla managed to pick up some mach 50 speed on the longer glissade shoots.  \
\
Higher up from where we entered the avalanche-meadow we negotiated a less brushy trek across the alder and burned stand.  Heading back into the old-growth forest, we began the long walk out.  Meandering through the Valley of the Silent Men once more, we took time to admire the mossy rocks and plunge pools.  Arriving at the emerald green waters of Lena Lake, the trail seemed to become-as Beckey would put it-filled with excessive switch backs. (So much for the nice warm up on the way up in the morning).  We resisted the temptation to duck under the wooden rails and kept our boots on the long gentle path downward.  Along the way we took better notice of the stream violets, purple peavine, oak fern and the Pacific yew grove near the start of the trail.  We made it back to the cars by 8:20 and refueled with the remaining cheeze-its and a few swigs of Wild Turkey.  A good day and good times had by all.  Thanks Carla, Yana and Yoav.\
\
Some somewhat useful trail stats:\
Elevation gain: 6,200 + feet (why does the trail go up on the way down?)\
Mileage: ~15 depending on which book you consult\
East peaks found: 0\
References made to Team America: approaching infinity\

,"Sissyphit","With weather reports making the west side of the mtns looking bad and even sunday on the eastside possibly rainy, I went over to Mazama.  Leaving around 4:30, I got to the base of Goat Wall around 8:30 (took the diretissimo approach instead of even trying to find the trail) with the goal of trying Restless Native.  Supposedly, the route is 10-11p long following the bluish/greenish rock to the right of the Goat's Beard.  After hiking around the base for 1/2hr staring up and trying to find any bolts or anchors and not finding a trace of anything (not even higher up), I busted out the topo for Sisyphus (11p, .11a) and easily found the base of that route.  Melissa linked the 1st 2 pitches, a short and easy 5.7 then a slightly tenuous couple of 5.9 slab moves followed by some easier climbing made for nearly a full 60m.  I then led the next pitch, a .10- that goes up a steepening buttress on good holds.  For whatever reason my shoulder felt totally tweaked after that (could it be that I've been climbing a lot lately?), so, that along with the increasing wind and the light rain that was comming down, I suggested that we bail.  This .10 pitch that I led wanders to the right of the rappel route, so we climbed the next pitch of 5.2 to be in line with the stations.  The route and rappels can be done with a single 60m rope, but we had climbed on my half ropes since we would have needed 2 60m to get off restless native.  2 rappels later we were on the ground.  By that time the sun was out and it was warm, so we went for a short hike then had happy hour on my folk's deck in Mazama.\
For anyone looking to do Sisphus:\
-BRING HELMETS.  The first 5 pitches cross over a bunch of ledges covered with loose rock.  I got hit several times just from the rope brushing a ledge.  Pulling the rope from out first rappel was terifying as we were clipped into a fixed anchor and knew the rope was going to drag across 3 ledges with all the rock bits funneling to where we were.  I think I was hit with more rock on this route than th rest of my climbing career so far (says a lot about how much I get into the mountains).\
-Don't do the route when other folks are on it.  You, or they will kick off rocks, break holds, or just some how send rocks flying.\
\
All in all I was not that impressed by this route, maybe only **.  The rock quality was sub par and the climbing not all that interesting.  Maybe it gets better higher up? The bolts were just off to the side of large, lichen-covered holds, making me think that the FA party was trying too hard to force the harder climbing.  However the setting was awesome and the steepness made for a small big-wall feel.\
I would still be interested in trying the Restless Native route, if I was looking at where I thought it shoud be, it follows a steep section of rock where one wouldn't run into these scree ledges.\
Here's the Sisphus topo if you're interested [url:g6c227th]http&#58;//www&#46;mountaineers&#46;org/nwmj/images/041/041Shorts_SisyTopo&#46;pdf[/url:g6c227th]"
,"Tieton: The Bend","Michael and I made the drive over to the dry side Saturday for a little crack climbing at The Bend along the Tieton river.  The day started cool and windy, but cleared up to sunny and perfect after lunch.  We started off with Ed's Jam and climbed a number of other routes off Ed's Jam ledge including Peace, Love, and Rope, MX, Seizure, and top roped the offwidth to the left of MX.  Seizure has a cool roof which one pulls over on handjambs.  Gear note: Rapping off the MX anchors back to Ed's Jam ledge requires two ropes or a long single.  I had a 65m which barely reached.\
\
After lunch, I got my opportunity to pull through a roof on Salmon Song (after hanging from the rope to scope it out).  Then Michael floated up Pure Joy.  Hallowed Ground finished me off for the day and we packed out as the sun was setting over the ridge.  Mexican in Yakima, and back in Seattle by 11.\
\
Good day."
"Colchuck-peak","Colchuck NBC-Gravity Assessment Day 5/19","After attending the best damned couples wedding shower I've ever been to Friday night, I went home and took a little nap before picking up Obadiah at 0100.  The plan was for Obadiah \""Let's rap the couloir\"" Reid and I to make the second installment of the Dragonchuck ascent series.  This time we would climb Chuckanaut; the Colchuck NBC with a traverse to the NE gully of Argonaut.  With an infallible plan and a history of success on Colchuck, we set out on what was destined to be a momentous day in Cascade climbing.\
\
Caffeine, Morphine, and Howlin' Wolf got us to the trailhead at 0330 and we started hiking 20 minutes later.  The first bad sign was that after opening my car door, I promptly stepped in a lake of sorts, flooding my crocs, and presoaking my climbing socks.  We did some headlamp illuminated limbo and hurdles of blow down on the trail, reaching the lake at 0600.  We putzed around at the lake pooing, eating, and filling water for a while before putting on our crampons and harnesses.  It was about 0700 when we started ascended the moraine.\
\
We followed the lateral moraine to enter the couloir high, rather than dropping down and doing an alpine sit-start.  There was another climber behind us, doing the full couloir solo.  From our perch on the moraine, we assessed situation and determined that \""it isn't that steep.\""  We decided to hold off with the rope and opt for speed through the couloir (we were welcomed with a small, belching salvos of rockfall).\
\
We made a casual, ascending traverse to a rock step that seemed to be about 3rd class.  The snow at the toe of the rock was giving way so I packed down some solid steps and reached up to make a dry tool placement.\
\
The snow gave out under my feet and I was instantaneously hurling down the couloir out of control.  The next few seconds, as I bounced, spun, and cartwheeled down the mountain were a Joycean amalgamation of thoughts:\
\
shit im falling.  i need to arrest.  i can't get my axe.  im going to break my leg.  there will be a helicopter.  im on my back, head down, just like freedom of the hills, i can arrest, ill reach for my axe.  im not touching the snow any more.  this is hopeless i am completely fucking out of control and i cant arrest and i am going to die.  any second i am going to cease feeling anything.  shit, granite; i need to protect my face.  im going to hit that rock and ill be unconscious.  hey, im still conscious.  im going to ride this couloir all the way down the mountain and im completely at its mercy.  shit, there goes Obadiah's ice screw.  no wait, the screws are in my pack, what was that?  hey, im feet first and slowing down.\
\
I came to rest near the other climber who was below us.  All in all, I took a good 300 footer.  We exchanged a round of \""holy shits\"" and \""that was excitings.\""\
\
\""Obadiah, I'm alive.\""\
\""You're what?\""\
\""Alive....and I think ok.\""\
\
\""I feel mostly intact, but I taste blood.\""  I checked for broken bones, but didn't feel any.  I thought my nose might be the source of the blood.  My face felt like a basket ball with snow burn.\
\
The other climber replied, \""You look mostly intact.  You have a cut under your left eye.\""\
\""Bleeding pretty bad?\""\
\""No, just enough for a good story.  Your nut tool went by, but kept going.  What happened?\""\
\
I told him what I thought happened and tried to collect myself.  Meanwhile, Obadiah had been down climbing to recover my corpse.  \
\
The climber started up, then looked at me, \""You coming up?\""\
\""Shit dude, I don't know.  I'm going to take a little breather first.\""  My helmet was completely packed with snow......maybe that helped?\
\
After a minute, I climbed up a ways to meet Obi and we had a little moment of reflection.  It didn't look steep and didn't feel sketchy.  Had we been roped up, we wouldn't have had any pro in yet so Obadiah would have *tried* to arrest my kamikazee fall.  It was just a freak thing with big consequences and I got lucky as hell.  The soloist took his time to climb that section, but pulled it without a hitch.\
\
\""Well, if you want to keep going, I'm totally up for it, but if you want to bag it and call it a day I'll completely understand,\"" Obadiah said.  Needless to say, Argonaut was out at this point.\
\
I thought it over.  I was considering the Darwin award I would receive if something else happened.  Ultimately,  the decision was:  I am largely uninjured from the fall and can keep climbing.  The route is not beyond our abilities.  There's no reason why we can't rope up, protect everything, go slow, and make the most of a beautiful climbing day.\
\
After roping up, I began to lead up the couloir, placing rock pro.  I have to admit that as I came back to the rock step, it was the first time in my life I've had Elvis legs on a snow climb.  We continued up the couloir uneventfully and topped out at the notch at 1100.  The adrenaline had worn off, the post-holing sucked, and we were both wasted.  We had some food and water and Obadiah took the lead for the face up to the summit.\
\
The snow was firmer on the face and we had some fun ice and mixed pitches.  Our progress was slow, as we were now big fans of protection and we were also getting tired.  Obadiah had some good ice and rock leads that put us one the summit at 1400.  We had some more food, took off the climbering gear and started down at about 1500.  The scramble down was uneventful and we glissaded everything we could because we were frickin tired.\
\
It was about 1600 when we started hiking, but the maze of boot tracks and social trails left us befuddled for a while.  We made pretty good time once we got on the right trail and got back to the car at 1840, roughly 15 hours after we left.  We hit up the 76 station for caffeine and we were home before 2200 (bedtime).\
\
Lessons to be learned, of course.  Maybe this will shed some light on Justin's question about when to rope up.  I don't know why I'm still alive, but I'll take it.\
  \
The casualties are as follows:  my face, a jammed finger, some scratches, a shredded brand new back pack, a nut tool and biner lost, a dent in my camera, a smashed tupperware, torn pants, ripped glove, spilled burly bars, and some helmet stickers.\
\
Sorry for the length and poor word to photo ratio.  Maybe Obadiah and I can do an interpretive dance for Jesse and others who like visuals.  Hopefully, Obadiah will post some photos, as my computer sucks.\
\
Be safe out there, kids!"

Snow Creek Wall\

This Saturday, Lindsey and I climbed Orbit.  I’ve been up there before and seen the crowds that can arrive, so we left Friday night and car camped to get an early start.  Approach was uneventful, but the flowers are blooming like crazy right now which made for a nice start.  \

The climbing was quick and low/mid fifth except for a fun chimney (although it was a pain with a pack on) and the great, optional flake on the 2nd pitch.  \

We did the chimney finish on Orbit which is definitely more fun than grabbing chicken heads up to the summit.  IMHO, Orbit is more adventurous than Outer Space, but Outer Space has Orbit beat when it comes to cracks.  Both are a ton of fun!!"
,"TR Cascade Pass - Birthday Tour 5/20","After finding out that Hwy 20 had already been open for more than a week my buddy Ben decided to head out to Washington Pass on Friday with his neighbor Dana for a 3 day weekend. I was planning on skipping out on this trip but getting a voicemail from the Mazama payphone on Saturday morning about how good the conditions were convinced me to haul ass out of work, throw all my gear in my car (which left my apartment almost empty) and get on the road. I finally got out of Seattle at 8:45 and after a short stop in Arlington for gas and a Rockstar I made it to Washington Pass at 11:30.\
\
Originally the plan was to climb the SW Couloir on S Early Winter Spire and then head in to Mazama for some sport climbing. Turned out though Dana wasn't too into climbing so I got over ruled and we decided to go for the Birthday tour, I was a little anxious, having never skied before but decided what the hell, I've got free rental AT gear from work I might as well learn to ski some time.\
\
We had a leisurely Sunday morning and got moving from the Blue Lake trailhead a bit after 8. It was pretty damn cold Saturday night so the skin up to Blue Lake Col was a bit tougher than expected and Dana and I both regretted our lack of ski crampons. We reached the col around 11 but decided to hang around to let the snow corn up a little more and let a faster party go ahead of us. After some instruction on survival skiing and some Booker's bourbon we took off at 11:30. By the bottom of that first descent I had managed to link a few parallel turns on the lower angle slopes and not blow out a knee, although my legs were a hell of a lot more tired than I thought possible.\
\
The skin up to the next notch was on much better snow conditions than the first and allowed my legs to recover somewhat. It was uneventful except for hearing a small avalanche release somewhere off to climbers right, but out of sight behind a ridgeline. We hit the notch a little before 2 and decided to stop and eat some food until weather started moving in and convinced us to start heading back to the car after a half hour or so. A short hike down through some scree brought us to breakable crust, but after a couple hundred feet of elevation loss it turned to decent corn which made for a mostly enjoyable ski out back to the hairpin. I even got some air off a small roller on the long traverse out to the road.\
\
Although my legs felt like they were about to fall off by this point I had a blast finally learning to ski and doing a tour that I've been hearing about from dudes at work. Sunday night about 2 inches of wet snow pasted everything down to around 4k feet so there might be decent spring snow if you head out along N cascades highway this weekend.\

,"White River Trail - 5/17","Wanted to start with a brief status update for trails and roads in the Lake Wenatchee area.

- White River Road is driveable to within 50 yards of the end today and probably driveable to the end by a passenger car after additional melting on Monday.
- Chiwawa River Road is driveable by a passenger car to 11 miles, where it is presently gated (even though the road beyond is snow free). Currently a 12 mile road walk to Trinity.  <!-- s:( --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_sad.gif\"" alt=\"":(\"" title=\""Sad\"" /><!-- s:( --> 

A rather interesting day out in the mountains. A few firsts: first time on the &quot;infamous&quot; White River Trail, first time going out with the intention of doing some bootleg maintenance, and first time having my car surrounded by a pack of dogs.

The last first happened on the drive in to the trailhead when, as I slowed to pass four dogs lounging by the side of the road, they fanned out and took up positions to the sides, in front of, and behind my car. The one in front got out of the way as I continued to roll forward, which is fortunate, because I'm fairly sure Michelle would no longer be on speaking terms with me if I hurt a dog. About two miles from the trailhead, I came across two guys and a girl with a big rig trying to clear a fallen tree from the road. Spent the better part of the next two hours pushing, sawing, pulling, jumping, and cursing before we finally managed to get the log clear. As we neared the trailhead, the snow deepened and I parked, not wanting to get my car firmly high centered. Fortunately, my parking spot was about 100 yards from the actual trailhead. Less fortunately, I went through the trouble of loading up my pack and riding my bike for those 100 yards.  <!-- s:? --><img src=\""{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_confused.gif\"" alt=\"":?\"" title=\""Confused\"" /><!-- s:? --> 

I was taken aback by the amount of snow on the White River Trail. While bare at first, after the first mile the snow became more continuous and after three miles I was navigating primarily by cut logs and the path of least resistance (even though the trail only gains about 50' in this stretch) In places, there was lots of water on the trail and I ended up doing some (successful) log hopping in one particularly deep patch. The bridge at Boulder Creek was out (as reported elsewhere), but I was able to locate a giant old growth log about 1/8 mile upstream that made for really easy walking. 

Beyond this point, I lost the trail in deep snow and was feeling pretty disheartened. This is the route that a few of us are hoping to use to exit Glacier Peak in a week and I just couldn't see it working with the amount of snow down on the ground. After an intense bought of postholing, I broke out into an alder thicket and thrashed uphill looking for the trail. Finding nothing of interest, I thrashed back downhill and discovered (much to my surprise) a solidly established, snow-free tread with minimal brush. Here, I traded trekking poles for a pair of loppers and went to work. Much of the smaller brush has yet to leaf out and the loppers made fast work of encroaching alder. At three points along the way, massive avalanches had come down off the face of Clark, covering acres of ground in snowy debris. These portions of the trail are going to be a real PIA if/when the debris melt out, but for now, it's easy walking. In a few places, creeks had decided that the trail made an excellent streambed, but there was (almost) always room to walk alongside. Snow started again in the woods by Thunder Creek and being at the edge of my map and well past my turn-around time, I called it a day here, wolfed down some food, and hoofed it back to the trailhead. 

The upper White River valley is a gorgeous and beautiful place, especially this time of year. If you're willing to walk through a bit of snow, you can avoid near all of the brush in the valley right now. Some spectacular waterfalls and great views of Clark Mountain. The trillium also make for quite a display on the smaller scale. I was following bear tracks all day and engaged in a rousing round of &quot;Hey, bear!&quot; at several times, but never did see that particular fine fellow. Did wonder at times of the wisdom of following bear tracks on a solo hike.

12 miles RT, ~100' gain.

Chris - I'm sorry, but I was not even tempted to look for your GPS.

"Vesper-peak","Vesper Peak and 3,000 vertical feet of glissading fun","My gym climbing partner and I decided to play hooky on Friday and hike up Vesper Peak.  The climb was an easy 6 miles round trip, with 4,000' gain in elevation and 4,400' climbing to the summit at 6,204'.  The only adventurous spots were the make-shift river crossings and the snow covered talus field.  All in all a super fun hike with awesome weather and views.\
