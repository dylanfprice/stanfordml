mount-baker,"Baker: Easton
I climbed the Easton Glacier this past weekend with a bunch of cool folks.\
\
Having been on four routes on Baker: C-D, NR, CH, and EG, I have to say that the EG and the NR are best for views (time the NR so the sun rises as you are on it)."

Pictures of aid climbing are more boring than pictures of bouldering, so I didn't take any.  Instead, I will explore the Eric Gratz-style \""images."

Since I had no takers on my invitation for Rainier or Stuart, I called up an old friend and asked if he would be up for the quest. We had never been in the area before, on Stuart or knew much of the route, so I figured two days to do the complete North Ridge with gendarme."
