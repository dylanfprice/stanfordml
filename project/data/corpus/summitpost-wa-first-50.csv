multi-day,"How Not To Take Your Girlfriend Camping
Black Peak Birthday WeekendWhen my girlfriend, Annie, asked me how I wanted to spend my birthday weekend, I said I wanted to climb Black Peak with her. It is one I have eyed for several years but just never got to. It looked like the perfect one for us as it is listed as a Class 3 scramble up the south ridge with camping by a lake and I had been to the area a year before when I did the Heather Pass loop hike. I really wanted to make sure she enjoyed this one as it would be her first overnight camping trip. She has done a few hikes with me this year and used to hike the mountains in Colorado when she lived there but this would be a step up from ones she had previously done and I really wanted to make it enjoyable for her. She is pretty tough and doesn’t complain on hikes but this would be my chance to show her how great this stuff is and convince her to join me on greater endeavors as well. We drove up Friday night, stayed in Mt. Vernon, WA and were off the next morning to Rainy Pass. We stopped for lunch at the Buffalo Inn Restaurant in Marblemount which was excellent. Sunny day, things were looking good. I had a new Osprey backpack and was looking forward to the trip. We left the car at the parking lot and were hiking up the switchbacks about 1 or 2 pm. I knew that Radek and his wife Shirley were going to climb the technical Northeast Ridge route with Haydar and Radek’s brother that day and we were tentatively planning on camping at Wing Lake that night together. I also knew that Tazz was planning on being there as well so this would be a nice first overnight hiking/camping trip for Annie (did I mention this was her first time not car-camping?). We would have friends, the weather was looking great, etc. I had most of the gear in my pack so Annie would have a nice light backpack too. My new pack was working great and I did not really notice how heavy the pack was. We made it to Heather Pass without incident and took a break for some crackers and salami. This was all good and well but we started noticing how many bugs there were which I thought was strange for how late in the season it was. Anyway, after our break, we caught the climbers’ path off the main trail towards Lewis Lake which would then head up to Wing Lake. What I did not know was that the path lost several hundred feet of elevation over a large boulder field. Maybe I did not read the route descriptions as thorough as I should have or maybe it is just a bit understated in the guide books but now I was sure Annie was wondering what I had committed her to. The boulders did take a toll on Annie and of course my losing the trail did not help when we were on looser rock in this section. She tweaked her knee and was hobbling before we got down to Lewis Lake. Because of this, I decided against the more direct boulder-hopping route around the left side of the lake and opted to try to find the “trail” that was supposed to exist around the right side of the lake. It was supposed to be a bit longer but I figured a trail would be better on her knee. We got around to the right side of the lake and then the trail disappeared on the shore (or at least I lost it). We climbed up and around a small hill and started bushwhacking as the trail was nowhere to be seen. We cliffed out on the left above the lake and had to climb more. We ended up sidestepping down a steep hill/cliff with loose dirt. I about bit it when a log gave way under my feet and that is when the fun really started. Annie gave a shout, “LOOK, LOOK, B-B-B-Bears!” Below us about 50 feet was a mother black bear and two cubs. She was herding them into the brush and up a tree slowly keeping an eye on us as she had spotted us first. I looked at Annie and she was near tears and scared. I reassured her that the bears were moving away from us and had no intention of coming at us. All the mom wanted to do was to make sure her kids were safe. We had the superior ground here and she would not be looking to attack us. It took a few minutes to calm her down but we then bushwhacked more into a clear spot at the bottom of a dry streambed/meadow. We were past Lewis Lake now and the ground would soon rise in front of us up to Wing Lake. I pointed out to her where we were going to and it was not that far away. There would be people there, we’d be safe, it’s above the trees and no reason for bears to go there. No sooner had I said that when she yelled “MORE!” Above us, maybe 50 yards away on a hillside above the meadow we were in was another mother and a cub and they had not seen us yet. I yelled “HELLO!” so they would not be surprised by us and they both stopped and looked. We stared at each other for maybe 15 seconds and Annie was now clearly not happy with my choice of hikes. I got between Annie and the bears and the mother got her cub on her backside. I told Annie we would slowly arc left away from them but we’ll stay on the edge of the meadow so they can see us. We started doing that and the bears did the same thing. They clearly were not interested in us all that much as they started munching on the blueberries that surrounded them on the hillside. Everybody did the big circle thing until we were at opposite ends of the meadow and we disappeared into the brush following the rocks in the dry streambed up. Annie was actually hilarious at this time although clearly not meaning to be. I told her the thing that would discourage any more bears from meeting us was the sound of a human voice. Annie is from Germany and although she has been a US citizen for 15 years and was an English major in college, she still has a slight accent. She boomed out a loud song that went something like “Hello bears, we are coming through! I am too skinny to eat, keep to your berries! Go away, I taste like crap! The guy in front of me has better marbling in his meat anyway!” It was quite funny with the accent. Also, by now, her knee was really hurting her. She wouldn’t let me take any weight from her pack and just trudged up after me. Also, the black fly and mosquito bites were adding up on her arms, legs and neck. I found out she is somewhat allergic to the bites and her arms, neck and legs now had hard bumps a few inches in diameter welling up. Finally, the trees gave way to open heather and we actually found the trail right before reaching Wing Lake just in time as Annie started to wonder when this day would be over. My wonderful introduction into overnight hiking and camping now had her limping, and covered in welts all after walking into groups of bears. Not exactly what I had aimed for. When we got to Wing Lake, I spotted Radek’s dog, Blondie. Blondie and I are old friends going back to when we slept in the back of Radek’s truck a few years ago before climbing Mt. Washington in the Olympics. (No man-dog jokes here, you know what I mean.) I actually belayed up Radek and Blondie one time on that climb. Well, I called Blondie’s name and the tail started thumping in the dirt. She was on a leash by the lake next to a water bowl and some packs. I presumed this meant they decided to climb already today and scanned the peak ahead. There was a group of 4 coming down in the scree and I heard Radek yell “Bloooo-ndie!” They soon got to us and said they started early that morning and did it as a day trip. Seemed Radek was not impressed with the quality of the route though. While they got some food and drink, I went up to drop our packs at a campsite. I had snuck some of Annie’s favorite snacks into the pack and wanted to surprise her. I returned with her favorite jar of Nutella and a spoon and although I had just taken her into an area where she got injured and walked through 5 bears, I actually did get a hug. Also, when I got back to the group, Tazz and 2 of her friends showed up. They did the south ridge that day and gave me some beta on the best way to go up the scree field beneath the peak. Radek’s group soon had to go back to the car and Annie and I went up to make camp. (We camped on the small hill left of Wing Lake in this photo.) We got the tent set up quickly (I love that new Black Diamond Lighthouse tent I have) and Radek, Shirley, Haydar and Tom walked through camp on their way out saying goodbye. Soon after, it was just Annie and I and the darkness around us. I brought some heavier foods to make sure she had a good meal. I was going to make my “chicken surprise” which is canned chicken, dehydrated veggies over Spanish rice, a little concoction I made after eating something similar on a mountaineering course I had taken years earlier. What I didn’t count on was the stove conking out on me…. I could get the thing lit but the flame slowly would die. I could get it to meagerly stay on if I shook the fuel canister certain ways. I took it apart and cleared some gunk from it and managed to get it going enough to where the water would almost bubble. Then it died again. And again. So, we ate cold chicken from a can while the mostly warm water tried to cook the rice. Eventually, it did work out to where we ate tepid rice from the pot. Annie was being a very good sport about it but I think I was still riding the Nutella karma at this point. The night was beautiful though, if a bit chilly. The summer was winding down and the air was crisp. We watched satellites cross the sky and then turned in. Thank God the new sleeping pad and sleeping bag we got for her worked well that night. I am not sure how much sleep she actually got, I remember my first night in the woods hearing wolves and lions and other monsters every few seconds and was sure she dealt with a bit of that that night as well. I also know the pain and numbness in her arms from the black fly bites was keeping her awake. We got up in the morning and I had another surprise in store for her. I had brought a civilian version of an MRE for her. These are the tv dinner-like meals that heat themselves on a heating element when you pour water on it. I can vouch for the quality of this one as the blueberry pancakes and bacon actually were kind of tasty. The morning was bright and beautiful and I got my fanny pack ready to go. We had decided that Annie would not climb today due to her knee but she wanted to hike up a ways with me. A few feet into the hike, it was evident that would not work. She was limping quite badly and I had to hurt her feelings a bit by telling her she was “slowing me down.” It was the only way that she would not follow me. In reality, she was not slowing me down that much because truth be -- I ain’t that fast. But she could barely put pressure on the leg and I did not want her to get hurt further. Call it tough love, it really sucked because she gave me a look like I had just slapped a puppy or something. I could see the realization come over her face though that it was the right thing to do and she turned back to hobble to the tent. Man, that sucked. I turned and went up the scree field, taking into account Tazz’s advice to cut back right under a rockband to gain better footing. It was true and I got to the saddle above the scree field and at the base of the south ridge in about 30 minutes. (Looking down from the top of the scree) (Looking up the route from the saddle) Again, I followed Tazz’s advice and stuck to the ridge instead of getting lured into the gully just left of it. It looks like easier ground in the gully but the rock is more solid, the views are better and it is easier going on the ridge. When in doubt, stick to the ridge until the gully and it meet up near the top. (Point where the routes meet) I could see down to the tent and kept waving to Annie although I couldn’t see her anymore and I doubt she could see me. Still having guilt about telling her to turn back, I guess. The route is pretty straight-forward and is cairned near the top. You end up traversing out right onto the ledges on the east face and come to a section of about 15 feet of loose ledgy stuff and near vertical rock. At this point, I was REALLY glad Annie was not there. She would not have liked it and would not have liked me doing it. There is a ledge below you on this section so if you fell, it would probably not mean death but it is definitely 4th class, perhaps 5.0?? Anyway, I did the couple or so moves to scramble up it and was finally on top of Black Peak, the first summiteer of the day. I took some shots and then downclimbed the tricky part, then it was just a nice hike down. The scree section was mostly a nice scree ski and I got back to camp by 10:30 am. I found Annie in the tent avoiding bugs. We filtered some water in the lake and sat snuggling there for a while before packing up. It was the one spot where there was a slight breeze that kept the bugs at bay. We then headed back and what took us about 2 hours to hike in from Heather Pass the day before was about 4 hours going out due to her knee. We just went slow and easy but it was hot that day. I kept taking things out of her pack on break stops and putting them in mine when she wasn’t looking. I bet she only had a 10 pound pack on the way out and didn’t realize it. I just felt like I had tanked on this trip and was just trying to get her back to the car and on to what I knew would be a good rest of the weekend. That boulder field between Lewis Lake and Heather Pass went on forever. When it did end though, it was extra nice because once back on flat ground, her knee did not hurt. She actually was much faster than me on the trail back to the car. It passed without incident, no bears, no injuries, just the constant hum of bugs in our ears. The sight of the car with intact windows was very nice to see a few hours later. I had some Hostess Ding Dongs stashed in there and they tasted extra sweet. From there we went to Winthrop where we had some damn fine pizza. After that we drove to Leavenworth, where I had a very nice hotel room waiting for us at the Bavarian Lodge. The great thing about it was that already she was starting to talk about how beautiful it was by the lake and how she actually enjoyed the food instead of the bugs, bears, bad knee, etc. But wait, it doesn’t end that nicely. Between Cashmere and Winthrop, some knucklehead crossed 4 lanes of traffic in front of us. I had to slam on my breaks to avoid him. I flashed my brights and tried to pass on the left but another car was coming up from behind. The guy now slammed on his brakes in front of me to try to get me to rear-end him. I slammed on mine and he pulled on onto the shoulder. So, I passed him and then he got on my ass with his brights on. This continued on for about 10 miles until we got to Leavenworth. I did not want him knowing where we were going so I drove through to the west end of town and turned to do a loop through the tourist section. He turned with me. I did a loop through and he followed me again. By now, I was wondering if this guy had a gun or something. He was in a pickup wearing a wife-beater shirt and backwards hat looking like something from Jerry Springer. I decided to play it safe and had Annie call 911 on the cell phone. By the time I was on my third loop down the main strip, the cops said they would come and I waited until the last minute to make a left into another hotel lot. The guy went slowly past hanging out of the truck yelling expletives. The cops pulled him over out of town and he gave some story about being from a reservation in Idaho going to see his kid on the coast. They told me I could file against him to take him to court but I sort of assumed the whole thing was over when he went past and got his little tirade out of the way. I would have had to go back to court there so I dropped the whole thing. Besides, we had a great hotel room to get to. Needless to say it is a great place to stay and I highly recommend it. They have a free breakfast buffet every morning with homemade biscuits and gravy, omelets, fresh-squeezed juice, etc. And the rooms are beautiful. We spent the next day in Leavenworth playing tourist. I did not know if Annie would think it was cheesy or nice, seeing that she is from central Germany. But, she said it was very authentic and now wants to move there (although that may have more to do with the 300+ days of sun per year compared to what we have in Portland). She actually brought her dirndl from Germany and wore it around that day. Only problem was that people there thought she was on break from working there instead of being the real deal. No problem though, when she ordered schnitzel or said any German words, even the locals could tell what was authentic.

I've come to the realization that when my wife is with me, plans just have to change. I took her backpacking in one of my favorite places this year, with a mind to summit a peak that I had not done yet. But, due to her limitations we ended up having a leisurely walk through the canyon instead. But, time with her in the mountains is more valuable. Besides, it's all beautiful, not just the summits. And the incident with the truck, I just cannot believe how unpleasant people can be. To imagine that he followed you all that way just to curse you out. He must truly have had nothing to do.

Still what are the odds to have bad bugs in late August, run into 5 bears, have the stove conk out all on her first trip out. At least it is a big laugh in retrospect (although her mom is now mad at me for taking her to the bears). :-) climberska - Sep 14, 2006 8:07 pm - Hasn't voted Black Peak Trip Excellent report. Just a couple of comments: I'd consider it a good day if I saw bears while hiking - not something bad. They are common in the North Cascades area, the Olympics, Mt. Rainier, etc. I do carry bear spray in a mesh pocket that I can reach while walking with my pack. Never had to use it on a bear. If I'm seeing bears that adds to the adventure. On bugs: use 100% DEET. It works. They don't bite - they don't even light - cause you're covered in toxic poison. It doesn't take much - a very small amount can be smeared a long way since it's oily. Thanks for the Lighthouse link. The tent weight is good (3.3 lb) but it doesn't look too aerodyanmic. Stove died? Make a very small wood fire. It will dirty your pot, but it works. I use the MSR XGK stove and it works every time. I'd probably get a whisperlite for use in the lower 48 if I were buying right now. You SHOULD have filed charges against the guy in the truck. Actually I can't say what should REALLY have happened to him, but you can imagine. I've had nearly identical encounters like the one you described. The good lord has blessed us with a generous helping of a-holes. Huh? It says we were created in his image? How's that work? rpc - Sep 14, 2006 8:11 pm - Voted 10/10 Re: Black Peak Trip Stove died?

Brian Jenkins - Sep 14, 2006 9:38 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Black Peak Trip Yep, I thought the bears were cool too. And they really were not interested in us, just the blueberries. I had DEET too, she decided on a parka at camp to combat the bugs instead as she has seen how that stuff can melt plastic. I was in a nasty storm on Granite Peak recently and the wide side of the tent was against the winds and it held up great. I would recommend it. They also have a version with the door on the narrow end called the First Lite or something like that too. I know they don't look too aerodynamic but I was surprised how well it did in a nasty wind and hail storm. I found the stove on a more recent trip that I want now. MSR Pocket Rocket. Used it recently on a trip to NH and ME and it was great. Plus, no line to get clogged which I think was my problem on Black Peak. Yeah, I would have liked to press charges but it would mean I would have to prove he did something illegal, tailgating me with brights on, which is what he denied to the cops. So, it would be word against word with no evidence. Ah well, another road rage winner. Thanks for the nice words! Lextalion - Jan 18, 2007 4:25 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Black Peak Trip Brian, The pocket Rocket is an excellent stove. However I have the Primus Omifuel which I like better due to the fact that the stove sits on the ground rather than on top of the canister. Yeah it weighs and cost more. But then again having the options of any type of fuel is so awesome for me. I also like the fact that i can boil 1 liter of water in about 3 minutes @ 9000'. Great trip report. Just took my wife on her first backpack trip in yosemite's lyell canyon area. And also took her up to the base of Mt lyell with 4 miles of trail gaining a little over 3000' of elevation. She's a tough cookie and did it very well, and again I learned to take it slower than I would with one of the guys on a ""PUSH"".

single-day,"Sloan Peak: The ""Matterhorn Of The Cascades""
Corkscrew Route - October 2, 2010 The North Face Of Sloan. Photo By John Gilbert Other Views: South Face West Face East Face At 7835 feet high, Sloan Peak is the 22nd most prominent point in Washington State. Catching a glimpse of Sloan from any angle gives a formidable impression. Fred Beckey has noted in his Cascade Alpine Guide that Sloan Peak has been called the “Matterhorn of the Cascades”. The fact that this massive precipitous mountain was not successfully ascended until 1921 speaks for itself. That’s not to say that climbers didn’t try. Beau And I On The Summit, October 2, 2010 I met Beau for the first time by pure coincidence this last February at the Perry Creek trailhead. We were already familiar with each other from our activity on Summit Post. I could immediately relate to Beau with his passion for peakbagging and affection for the Mountain Loop Highway. In July we met for our first trip together to do Winchester and Larrabee in the North Cascades. Then in September we met again one evening after work to climb White Chuck. Having established a mutual trust and respect for each other, it was time for a real test. One last big climb before the coming snows. One Of Three River Crossings I went to bed at 8:30 pm and lay there thinking about the corkscrew route. A major river crossing which sometimes requires wading up to your thighs, an overgrown trail leading up to exposed slabs, a glacier crossing, steep narrow ledges with cliffs above and below, scrambling up loose dirt and rocks to a maze of route finding issues. I had to sleep because the alarm was set for 2:30 AM but my heart was racing. I felt like I had just drunk a whole pot of coffee and was being chased by wild dogs. There were so many uncertainties. This would be my first time crossing a glacier as a two-person team rather than three. What would the river crossing be like in the dark? This would be Beau’s first time on a glacier. Sleep was slow to come and fitful all night. The Waterfall Crossing During the drive the next morning I had to concentrate to cut sections of cord and melt the ends with a lighter. It took me awhile to remember the knots but eventually I completed the job and Beau had a new set of chest and foot prussiks. The first of three crossings of the North Fork Sauk River was not fun. There was a fallen log to walk across but it was narrow. Looking down into the deep water on either side with the light of my headlamp I imagined the consequences of a fall. We made it across without incident but the next two crossings were equally unfavorable. At one point we had to switch from one log to another to another to get across a huge logjam. Near the bank I had to tightrope walk down a terribly narrow fallen alder, which was suspended over a deep pool. When we were safely on shore Beau named that part of the route “down sloping alder” which had me crack up and release all the nervous tension. I knew he was referring to the down sloping rock of our last climb together on White Chuck. “Down Sloping Alder” then became the slogan of the day. Ascending The Slabs Beyond the river the climber’s path was brushy, and difficult to follow in the dark. Pink ribbons placed on tree branches by other climbers were helpful. We crossed under one major waterfall. After gaining 3000 vertical feet we came into a small valley and had our first view of the summit. A rush of excitement hit us and refueled our motivation to push on. It would be another 3000 of vertical before we got there. The path terminated near a small meadow, at the base of exposed granite slabs. It was amazing to think that at one time the glacier had extended down this far. We scrambled up the slabs below the northeast ridge aiming for the low spot just west of Point 5852. Our First View Of The Glacier Starting Out Across The Glacier On the ridge crest we could see a large portion of the glacier we would be crossing. The crevasses were wide open and clustered in bunches where the ice was passing over convex slopes. Where the slope was concave, the crevasses were closed up and there was no visible threat. These concave areas I considered safe for travel and this was where we would try to weave our way through. Glacier travel in October has some pros and cons. The good thing is that the summers melt has made it so that you can see where all the dangers are. The bad thing is that most of the snow bridges are long gone and the ones that remain and usually narrow and untrustworthy. Beau and I briefly discussed proper glacier travel etiquette and I stressed the point that if you fall into a crevasse or otherwise you should yell “FALLING” so that the other climbers can immediately go into self-arrest. We then roped up, fixing prussik knots, donning helmets, glacier goggles, and our ice axes. Route Finding Issues Beau Crossing The Steep Snow Bridge Our goal was to reach the highest point of the glacier on its southwest corner. Starting out was easy enough. I led up a series of ramps between the clusters of crevasses. Then the going got a little tricky. We were right in the middle of the upper part of the glacier but we had come to an impasse. Here we were boxed in by crevasses on three sides. I tried poking around looking for an alternative way. It seemed like if we could just get up above the big one that was right above us, we could continue our direction of travel. I saw a series of angled snow bridges that looked doable but dangerous. I tried to weigh the hopes of our having enough time to make it to the summit against the safety of retreating and looking for a better way through the maze. I was afraid that a retreat would cost us too much time and we might lose our chance. I decided to try the bridges. The first one was short but the upper lip of the crevasse was higher and very steep. I made it across and told Beau not to step on the thinner middle part of the bridge. The next bridge was very narrow. It was about 9 feet long and only a foot wide in the middle. Looking down, I could see a fall here would be at least 35 feet. Since we were in a narrow section located between two different crevasses, if I went in here, I would pendulum swing a long way before Beau could stop my fall. I didn’t like it. I told Beau to turn back. We would have to find another way. In The Maze Of Crevasses Exposure On The Ledges For the next 45 minutes we zigzagged back and forth trying to find a way through the maze. Some route descriptions suggested traversing the upper edge of the glacier but I was going on the advice of a friend who had climbed Sloan recently and suggested cutting across about “two thirds of the way up”. I used my GPS to make digital tracks so we could follow our same route on the descent. Finally, at the southwest corner of the glacier, we stepped back onto solid rock. We quickly untied and left our rope, harnesses and axes in a heap. Exposure In The Dirt Gully Above The Dirt Gully Beyond the glacier the route turns onto the south face and follows a series of high ledges perched precipitously over 400 foot cliffs. This section of the corkscrew route is semi-famous among the local hiking culture. The boot path here is impressive in it’s placement and exposure but it seemed easy to us after our difficulty on the glacier. Fairly soon we had a good perspective looking up at the remainder of the peak, it's sheer south face. Pushing on we turned another corner and found that we were now on the west face, overlooking the Puget Sound, which was covered with a sea of clouds. Beyond the clouds the entire Olympic Range was visible. Beau began spouting out expressions of disbelief and amazement at what we were seeing. I had to admit, we weren’t even on the summit yet, but already these were the best views from any peak I had ever seen. Nearing The Summit The Summit Ridge The path ended at the base of a steep gully filled with loose stones and dirt. The rock in the fissure was of a different composition and was eroding much faster than the surrounding rocks. We scrambled up the gully hugging the left wall, which offered more handholds. At the top of the gully we turned left bearing north for our final approach of the summit. We were getting close. I could feel it. Now the route became harder to decipher. Where there was dirt, multiple faint paths were less convincing. Where there was rock, we did a lot of scrambling but none of it overly challenging. One move required holding onto a wall of rock while sidestepping a ledge about 10 inches wide, with a long drop behind. Eventually we ended up on giant talus and an exposed ridge top. Then I saw the summit. It was only 30 feet away now. SLOAN PEAK! I could not believe it. How many times had I viewed this monster from every angle on the surrounding smaller peaks? How many times had I thought to myself that it was probably outside my range of abilities? And there it was right in front of me. The highest point. I could reach out and touch it. I did. I followed the ridge crest which was a complete drop on the east side, 450 feet straight down to the glacier. Exercising some care I pulled myself up the last rock and stood on top. Beau was right behind me. The view from the summit of Sloan Peak Full Size We celebrated our summit with food and re-hydration salts. We could see all the way from Mount Baker up north to Glacier Peak in the east to Mount Adams down south. I told Beau that this had been one of the best climbs of my life, a true favorite right in league with Kilimajaro and Pico de Orizaba. To our dismay, we discovered that even though we had each started with more than 3 liters of water, we were down to about a half a cup. It was surprisingly hot for October, but there was a trickle down below the glacier and thankfully Beau had carried a filter. We could make it that far. Beau Enters The Gully The Narrow Ledge Above Cliffs Having started a 6:05 AM it was now 2:00 PM and the sun would be setting in roughly 5 hours. We were reluctant to leave such a splendid summit but it was the responsible thing to do. We scrambled down and followed the ledges back round to the far side of the mountain and the glacier. I was longing for the assurance that awaited us on the far side. If we could cross this mass of broken ice one more time, then surely no substantial malady could threaten us. I switched my GPS back on and we followed our digital tracks back through the labyrinth. The crossing was shorter and less eventful than the first time. We were about 100 feet from the edge of the glacier when I heard a sickening noise that turned my stomach. It had been a horrible whoomfing noise from underneath the snow somewhere nearby, the sound of stuff falling away. I froze and turned around asking Beau if he had heard it. He could see from the look on my face that I was concerned. He hadn't heard it, so maybe I had imagined it? We continued on, getting closer to the edge. Then I heard it again, twice. This time Beau heard it too. It's a god-awful sound to hear when you're crossing a glacier. Thankfully we made it to the rocks without any ground giving away. Descending The Glacier Descending The Glacier We refilled our water at the trickle and moved on down the slabs knowing that daylight would soon be leaving us. We made it past the meadow and into the timber before the dark closed in. I realized that the fall of night marked our moving time to be about 13 hours. It was fully dark when we reached the river crossings. I noticed that the water level had risen and some of the logs were now partially suspended and floating unstably. To make things more spicy the “down-sloping alder” over the deep pool now sagged considerably when any weight was placed upon it. There was no other way across. We had crossed those logs in the dark that morning and now it was time to cross them in the dark a second time. Maybe it was a good thing that we couldn’t fully see the rushing water below us. Neither of us took a spill. In fact after crossing so much rugged terrain, we hadn’t had a single fall all day. Back at the truck, it felt good to sit down after 14 hours on our feet. It felt good to take the boots off. Descending The Slabs Fall Colors I’d like to say thanks to Beau for doing some hair-raising driving that night in his exhausted state and thanks also for carrying that water filter. I'd also like to thank Josh Lewis for loaning us his lightweight glacier rope.

Actually I've spent many nights camping on glaciers. Usually you hear the cracking and creaking noises of the ice moving and splitting. On the other had, the sound of seracs falling down is loud and violent. This sound was softer and almost sounded like the noise they tell you to watch out for with weak layers and slab avalanches. Obviously at this time of year it was neither of those things. It just sounded like bug hunks of snow detaching and falling away into some cavity below. lcarreau - Oct 6, 2010 4:32 pm - Voted 10/10 Re: Great teamwork, guys..

single-day,"Shuksan In A Day
Introduction The Northeast Face, 2010 The East Face, 2011 Shuksan is an amazingly complex peak. The summit block towers over 9 separately named glaciers (6 if you don't count upper, lower, east, west divisions) and is commonly referred to as ""the pyramid"". Shuksan is the fifth highest non-volcanic mountain in Washington State. I have heard claims that it is also the most photographed mountain in the world, even more than the Matterhorn or Cerro Torre. At first I didn't believe it, but then after seeing it in countless hotel rooms in Europe and North America, painted on the side of a building in east Africa, and posted above an ice-cream parlor in southwest Bolivia, I started to believe. The North Face, 2007 My Shadow And Alpenglow On The Mountain, 2010 For years I have felt certain that my mountaineering obsession would one day draw me to this mountain, but for some reason I didn't feel the acute urgency that I sometimes contract with other mountains. Then this July, I climbed Olympus and Bonanza within a 6 day stretch, both of which involve massive elevation gain, glacier crossings, and rock climbing. After those climbs, I felt a new confidence in my own abilities. Shuksan came to the forefront of my mind. Although most parties take 2 to 3 days on the Sulfide Glacier route, I wanted to make a one-day ascent. This would require a very strong team. For a few weeks I discussed the idea with my friends Matt and Colleen. We were all agreed and keen to give it our best shot. We waited for an ideal weather window. Shuksan In Fall, 2006 Shuksan In Winter, 2007 Friday July 22, 2011Sunny skies predicted in the forecast. After work, we drove to the trailhead at 2400 feet, and set our alarms for 1:00 am. I put my sleeping bag on the ground next to the car and slept for a couple of hours. Saturday July 23, 2011 When I got up, I scarffed down a quick breakfast. By 1:35 am, we were moving along the trail with our headlamps, crossing streams in the dark. Eventually we rose above the snow line and the trail disappeared. It was harder to follow the route through the snow in dense forest. Organic debris from the trees made boot tracks harder to follow in the dark. (I later found out that a search and rescue operation was launched the same day to find a lost climber on this section of the trail). With paper maps and two GPS devices we were able to find our way to the top of Shannon Ridge. We stumbled upon a campsite where a disgruntled man, half hanging out of his tent, told us ""you want to go that way"" before turning over and going back to sleep. Mount Baker Before Dawn Mount Baker After Dawn On the ridge crest the trees thinned out and soon we were on open snow. Shannon Ridge was looming large in front of us, but there wasn't enough light to make out any details. We followed old boot tracks up to a pass and crossed through cliff bands to the east side of the ridge, passing more tents as we went. When we reached 5500 feet I noticed the sky to the east was growing brighter. It would just be another hour or so until sunrise. We could see a pink halo tracing the horizon as solar rays illuminated the atmosphere. To the west I could see Mount Baker. I used my ice axe as a tripod in the snow to take some long exposures. Then the first rays of light hit the volcano and it turned pink. I was the first one to notice it and I made a bunch of obnoxious excited noises. Matt and Colleen climbed up to my vantage point to see what all the fuss was about. Nearing The Glacier Scenic Camp Spot We continued to climb on snow, as near to the ridge crest as the cliffs and rock formations allowed. We were now on the edge of the massive Sulfide Glacier. To cross the glacier safely and head straight for the summit pyramid would necessitate roping up. But that was not our plan. I have several friends who had assured me that if you contour the far left edge of the glacier, there is no danger of a crevasse fall. These friends of mine have literally thousands of ascents worth of experience and one of them has climbed Shuksan 5 times, so I trusted their advice. Our route was not as direct as the standard Sulfide crossing, but it would be faster without taking the time to rope up. The Summit Pyramid And Crevasses Climbing Steep Snow Just before the sun hit the snow, we passed an amazing camp site. Two tents stood erected in the center of four rock pinnacles which jutted out of the ridge at different angles, resembling the petals of an opening flower. As a backdrop, the predawn horizon was still shining pink. I swore to myself that if I ever climbed Shuksan a second time, I would bring my tent and pitch it right there. We climbed up through a thin layer of clouds and then the sunlight touched down around us turning the snow yellow and the shaded areas blue. We could see the pyramid now, standing tall above the glacier. It looked impossibly steep, but I reminded myself that this was an optical illusion, caused by looking directly at a steep slope. We could see that most of the standard scramble route up the central gully on the south face was still filled in with snow. Unusually cold and wet weather in Washington this year has made many of our climbing routes at least one month behind schedule for normal melted-out conditions. The Objective The Pyramid We reached the base of the pyramid and were careful to traverse over to the right side so we could get around the bergschrund that was partly open. Having passed so many tents, we couldn't help but wonder where everyone else was. For as far as we could see, there was no one on the glacier coming up behind us. What happened to good old-fashioned alpine starts? We climbed up the base of the central gully following the steps that were already kicked in. The slope now exceeded 60 degrees. The whole south face of the pyramid was still in shadow and the snow was as hard as ice. It was frozen so hard that we couldn't even jam our ice axes through the crust layer. There was no choice but to seek out the holes where others had previously placed their axes. But in some places, no such holes were available. In those spots we swung our axes like ice-tools, jamming the picks in as deep as we could for security. Climbing The Base Of The Pyramid On The Rock Rib The slope grew steeper again and the steps ended at a rock rib. We scrambled up the rib and our crampons screeched and skidded on the rocks. On the other side of the rib the steps continued on icy snow. We were now about half way up the pyramid. I could feel that the air was thinner here. I usually notice altitude somewhere between 8000 and 9000 feet as a shortness of breath and a slight dizziness that comes with exertion. The slope was growing steeper, approaching 70 degrees. We had to climb through one bottle-neck where the snow was only a foot wide, with rock ribs on either side. The snow was thin and we had to exercise extreme caution. Above The Rock Rib Above I could see the remainder of the central gully up to the left. There were no steps going that way. Instead they turned to the right and ended on the southeast ridge of the pyramid. We were still in shade and the snow was like concrete. To climb the gully we would have to rely only on the front points of our crampons. Without proper ice-tools it was not a safe option. But the southeast ridge? That route was said to be anywhere from YDS 5.4 to 5.6 and extremely exposed. It was recommended to bring your rock shoes if attempting that route and nobody in our group had anticipated we would need them. Exposure In The Bottleneck We climbed up off of the snow and scrambled a short way before coming to a near vertical wall, 35 feet high. Matt scouted ahead along a small ledge which looked like it might go around the wall on the east face of the pyramid. The drop behind him was 1000 feet down to the Crystal Glacier. He came back and told us it was no good. I could tell from the tone in his voice that I didn't want to investigate it myself. I put my pack down so that I could climb up the base of the wall and see if there was any way to protect it. I was hoping to find a horn or a crack or just anything. The rock was all down-sloping without any major features. You would have to be pretty creative to set an anchor on this wall. 10 feet up the wall I could see what lay ahead and I didn't like it. A slip there would be fatal. I down-climbed back to the group. Colleen and Matt had to tell me where to put my feet as I couldn't see anything below an overhang. At The Base Of The Wall We talked about what we should do. Colleen's GPS was reading 9000 feet, just 130 shy of the summit. It seemed we had 3 options. The first option was for one of us climb this wall unprotected and see if there was anything above it that would serve as a belay station. I asked if either of them felt bold enough to do that since they both have a lot more rock climbing experience than me. After all, this was only my third time on rock. Neither of them liked the looks of it. Matt was worried about what he might find above the wall. What if he got up there and there was no place to set up a belay or rappel? It was a valid point. Option number two was that we rappel back down to the gully and try to follow the steep exposed snow up to the summit or over to the southwest ridge which didn't look any better. But that wouldn't be safe until the snow had been in the sun long enough to soften up, a matter of several hours. Our last choice would be to turn around. I certainly didn't want to do that. There wasn't a cloud in the sky and it was still early morning. ""The hell with it"", I thought, we can sit here and wait if that's what we have to do. Climbing The Wall But then we heard voices below us. There was another party coming up. We waited to see what they would do. I felt a little embarrassed to be sitting around at 9000 feet, unsure of our next step. The two young men appeared and climbed right past us, unprotected all the way up the wall. We asked them if they could see any anchor points near the top and they said yes. Excellent! We wouldn't have to wait for the snow after all. Matt climbed up unprotected following the same line as the other guys. Next, Colleen climbed up with a belay, and I went last. We all left our packs and crampons at the base of the wall. I scrambled a little higher and was surprised to see that the summit was not an exact point as it appears from afar but an elongated ridge with a couple of high points. We went to the highest one which was still shrouded in snow. I could now see many parties down on the Sulfide Glacier approaching the pyramid. I smiled to myself. It's about time those lazy bums got moving. Climbing Up To The Summit I looked at Mount Baker and remembered how small Shuksan had seemed from that summit, even though Baker is only 1300 feet higher. Right below us on the north face was the incredible Hanging Glacier, riddled with enormous crevasses. I stared at Mount Larrabee to the north and recalled fond memories of that climb with my friend Beau. And there was Tomyhoi! Where I met Greg Slayden for the first time when he invited me to join the expedition to South America. To the south were the giant volcanoes, Glacier Peak and Mount Rainier, also memorable climbs. We spent some time trying to guess which ones were Hozomeen and Jack Mountain. Then I spotted Mox Peaks. That sent a chill up my spine. Many climbers say the Mox grouping is the most dangerous on the Washington Top 100 . Point 8501, also known as ""Hardest Mox"" saw its first ascent just three years ago. Colleen Makes The First Rappel The Third Rappel It was time to go down. We wanted to get off the ridge before it was choked with multiple parties. We rappelled down the wall and collected our gear. Two more rappels on snow brought us part way down the gully. Several other parties passed us on the way up. We down-climbed the lower half of the pyramid, facing in. The snow had softened up a little but was not good enough for plunge-stepping. At the base of the pyramid we retraced our steps around the bergschrund and over to the far edge of the glacier. It was early afternoon and the blinding light from the snow was making us hot. The reflection burned the underside of my nose and inside my mouth. Matt ran out of water and then Colleen did as well. Mine was last to go. I filled my hat with snow several times and let the water drip down over my head and body, soaking my clothes. I've learned that this can lower body temperature and slow sweat production when drinking water is scarce. Down-Climbing There were a number of nice glissade slopes on the way back to Shannon Ridge. I made full use of that. I remembered to retrieve my trail runner shoes at the pass but unfortunately I blew right past my water filter which I had stashed next to the last stream in the woods. Matt and Colleen had to wait for me as I climbed back up to find it. Back in the parking lot, we ate food for an hour and then laid back down on the ground for a second night on the dirt. After 15 miles and nearly 16 hours of climbing, we were so tired. We didn't feel like driving anywhere. From the very beginning, I suspected this would be the case. But who cares! We climbed Shuksan in a day. And honestly, I'm more content sleeping outside in the forest than I am in my own bed.

multi-day,"Liberty Ridge, a memorable climb
Late Season Fools on Liberty RidgeI feel we lucked out at every turn on this mountain. We stood beneath melting serracs, crossed soft snow bridges, escaped avalanches, evaded rock falls, found alternate routes over the bergshrund, endured foul weather and foiled hoards of mice. We didn’t survive because we were wise or great mountaineers; we were just plain lucky. I have every respect for the formidable Mount Rainier. Why she let these late season fools walk away without a scratch is a mystery to me even to this day. A Dreadful lower ridge From left, Steve, Dick, Marc Bivy behind Thumb Rock It felt like it was hours that we were struggling up extremely loose and steep dry ground. I had expected Liberty Ridge to be frozen solid or at least to have hard snow on it. So where was all the snow and ice? For a while every step started a rock avalanche. I was trying to stay a couple hundred feet in front but not in direct fall-line from my climbing partners, Steve and Dick. Whose idea was this anyway? I was asking myself. Well, doing Mt. Ranier was mine, doing Liberty Ridge was Steve’s, and Dick? He always came along, never said much, was predictably late, consistently disorganized, and always ended up shining on the climb. I saw a rock about 2 x 3 feet in size. “That must be big enough to stand on and rest,” I thought to myself. I made my way to it and stood on it. “ Ah, that feels good.” It took only seconds before the rock started to move. I slid down a few feet with it and quickly fell to the side and stopped. The rock, however, didn’t. I yelled down, “Rock!” I couldn’t see Dick, but Steve looked up for a second and looked down again. I yelled, “BIG Rock, guys!” Steve disappeared too. The rock avalanche was sizable and headed directly toward them. I looked in their direction and prayed. When the slide—more like a trundle—stopped, I yelled down, “Are you guys okay?” “Yeah!” someone yelled back. I thought to myself, “I could have killed my two best friends.” The Approach Two weeks later was the 4th of July long weekend. The three of us rushed to rent a car at the Seattle Airport and get under way. When we stopped at the ranger station to pick up a permit, we were warned that a storm was coming in three days. He also told us that they had rescued two climbers from Liberty ridge two days earlier. Apparently one of them had been hit on the face by a rock. Dick said, “You know what that means, guys. We have to hurry!” By 3:00 p.m. we were hiking up the trail. It didn’t take long before we could see the entire north face of Mt. Ranier and Liberty Ridge itself. A friend of mine who had done the route a month earlier had commented, “The first time you recognize Liberty Ridge you will want to turn around and go home. Don’t be discouraged. It’s not as steep as it appears.” The approach to Carbon Glacier went pretty smoothly. We camped close to its edge and watched the sunset do its afternoon dance on the north face of Rainier. I’m not sure if I got any sleep that night; I couldn’t wait to get started early in the morning. If it had been up to me, we would have started pre-dawn before snowbridges got too soft to cross. Getting Dick and Steve out of their bags, however, was a challenge. The Glacier It took some coaxing and cajoling to get my buddies going. Dick muttered, “This feels more like work than vacation.” Carbon Glacier was fully sunlit when we came to the first seracs. They were leaning and melting like a faucet that was left on. This was when we made our next foolish mistake by filling our water bottles. I guess the mountain gods were on our side to keep the seracs from rolling on top of us and to keep the snow bridges from collapsing under our feet. We made fast progress toward the base of Liberty Ridge with our eyes scanning for any snow gullies. None were to be found. The most solid rock section was a broken up steep step about forty feet in height. I pointed, “That’s our route, but we can’t use a rope.” I was afraid a rock would break off and hit the rope, taking me down with it into the gaping mouth of a crevasse below. Willis Wall looming above The Ridge Rock Step Thumb RockThe rock step turned out to be easier than I had expected. I was the first to arrive on the ridge proper. Dick was next, but when he showed up on top, he was tied into one of our two ropes. He said he wanted to belay Steve. “Okay, Steve. Climb!” Dick shouted down. I started working my way further up the ridge. Within minutes I heard a loud crash! I yelled down, “Are you guys okay?” Steve had pulled a large loose rock off the rocky section, but he was okay. We moved carefully and methodically. I was praying for some snow and ice. I was tired of finding my way through steep and loose scree. A few hundred feet below Thumb Rock, our bivy site and objective for the day, I came across the first hard snow. I took out the rope, flaked it out on a rock, and quickly put on my crampons. By now Dick was there. I handed the rope to him and asked him to feed it out. In what seemed less than an hour, we were all on the base of Thumb Rock. Liberty Wall Thumb Rock is a 300 foot formation made of broken volcanic rock. Just opposite of Thumb Rock there is another loose formation, and in between the two there is barely enough room for two small tents. Dick and Steve shared a very small tent; I had a tarp that could double up as a tent. During dinner we heard a loud crack. An avalanche plumetted down Liberty Wall only a few hundred feet away. Around ten o’clock at night it rained for a short time. I worried obsessively that a rock would break off Thumb Rock and land on us. My fears came to be realized in the middle of the night when I heard another loud crack. It was a rock about a foot long that broke off the other formation and rolled to within feet of our bivy site. Sheer luck. I am predictably bad at getting sleep the first two nights in mountains. The rock fall didn’t make it any easier to get any shut eye. In any event, morning dawned and Dick, Steve and I had to get going. We had 4,000 feet of steep snow and ice to climb. The Shooting Gallery It had rained on us for a short time the night before. Rain at 10,000 feet? I thought to myself. This cannot be a very good sign. In the morning one of the first things I noticed was hearing the sound of running water. By 8:00 a.m. it sounded like thousands of creeks running down Willis Wall to our left. Within a few hundred feet we came to what I called “The Shooting Gallery.” We had to go through a rocky formation that looked like a gun sight. Countless smaller rocks had come down the gun sight and scarred the steep slopes below. We scanned with our eyes for any possible alternate way to go up. None seemed any better. Just above Shooting Gallery Dick started to lead, heading straight up. Small avalanches of sand and pebbles poured unrelentingly down the middle of of the gun sight. Dick hadn’t reached the worst part yet when we saw some bigger pieces coming through the notch. One piece was noticeably larger than the rest. It missed Dick and came directly toward me. I didn’t want to jump out of the way until it got closer. I was tied with a 4-foot leash to my ice axe that was buried in the snow. I had to be sure which way to jump. By now the rock had picked up considerable speed and was tumbling down toward my legs. At the last second I jumped to my right. The rock hit my ice axe’s adze and bounced, missing me by two feet. “Let’s hurry up and go through this, guys!” I yelled. Upper Ridge Once we passed the Black Pyramid, we could not hear the running water anymore. The temperature dropped quickly and we put on extra layers of clothes. From this point on we did not see any more rock falls. The ridge seemed pretty consistent at 40-45 degrees with steeper sections peppered in mostly hard snow. Not much different from any other volcano: the higher you climb the less obvious the summit’s location. Still, we figured that as long as we were going up, we should be getting closer to the top. I worried about the infamous bergshrund that I knew we had to overcome. But where was it? We finally reached a vertical section about 15 feet. No, this was not the shrund. There were no crevasses on either side, and it didn’t look like the photos I had seen. The three of us were tired. Progress slowed down considerably. And then I saw it: bergshrund ahead. Upper Willis Wall Approaching Storm Getting Lucky Dick leading the first step Ptarmigan RidgeA gaping crack that seemed endless was a few hundred feet ahead. My eyes were panning to the right and left for the narrowest part of the bergshrund. Way to the left there seemed to be a section that I couldn’t make out. Hoping that it might be a bridge, I headed that way. The closer I got, the more promising the prospect. When we finally got close enough, I saw that a huge avalanche had covered part of the main bergshrund. I breathed a sigh of relief and told Dick who was just behind me, “That’s it, Dick!” We climbed on to the avalanche debris. Summit Bivouac Melting snow near the summit of Liberty CapThe sun was dropping down toward the horizon like a rock. We had just finished a long, very steep section of avalanche debris and the slope kicked back to about 40 degrees again. We were too busy to pay much attention to a sea of clouds that had begun to cover the entire landscape below our feet. Steve was tired and suggested that we dig a hole and stay there for the night. I objected to that strongly: if the storm actually hits, we needed to be closer to the top so we could head down the opposite side of the mountain. Liberty Ridge was too steep and dangerous to contemplate using it as an escape route. Dick agreed and got in front to lead another vertical step. Steve followed using his headlamp. Then it was my turn to climb. I asked Dick and Steve to turn off their headlamps so that I could climb with what little light was coming from the horizon. Then I was on top! Soon we were all on top of Liberty Ridge! The ground became nearly perfectly flat. We melted snow for drinking and made hot water bottles for our sleeping bags. There was little energy left for conversation after our long, hard day. There on top of the ridge we rested our beaten bodies for the night. Summit of Liberty Cap, Mount Rainier, Descent down Emmons Glacier Summit of Liberty Cap. The dirt patch visible behind us is the summit of Mount Rainier. Summit of Rainier in full condition When we crawled into our bags the night before we didn’t know exactly how far we were from the top. I was the first one out of my bag in the morning. Looking up I realized we were only a couple of hundred feet from the summit cone of Liberty Cap. Hurriedly I put on my crampons and grabbed my pack heading for the summit. Steve and Dick stuck their heads out of their tent and gave me dirty looks for being so chipper. “See you on top, boys!” I shouted obnoxiously. When I got to the top I realized that the entire mountain—except for the two summits—was socked in. It didn’t take long for Dick and Steve to show up on top. After taking a few summit shots, we proceeded to drop down about 400 feet to the saddle between the Liberty Cap and Columbia Crest. Another 800 feet of easy hiking put us all on top of Mount Rainier. Getting Lucky again By the time we reached the main summit of Mt. Rainier, the storm was upon us in its full fury. We scrambled to take a few summit photos, then turned to the task of descent. Our original plan was to find Saint Elmo’s Pass which would lead us back to the north side of the mountain. But with the storm and cloud cover, we decided that finding the pass would be nearly impossible. Fortunately I had located a trail of footprints heading down toward the east side of the mountain. It would take us down to Emmons Glacier. We headed down. By the time we reached the treeline, darkness was upon us. We were forced to spend another night on the mountain. Although it rained most of the night, we were so tired that nothing kept us from sleeping—not even being attacked by hundreds of persistent mice trying to burrow into our sleeping bags with us. In the morning we headed down the trail in an on-and-off rain. We ran into two climbers going up the mountain who were planning to approach Liberty Ridge via St. Elmo’s Pass. I told them about rain on our Thumb Rock bivouac sight, and the rock falls that had nearly finished me. Prudently they decided to cancel their climb and go back down with us. They also offered to take one of us to the north side parking lot to get our car. Steve volunteered to go. Lucky again, since we had no other way to get to our car parked 60 miles away. Call me lucky; call me superstitious. I think Mount Rainier let us “Three Late Season Fools” off the hook too easily. Or, may be she was touched by the love we had for her.

multi-day,"It doesn't Get Much Better than this: 4 Days on Mount Logan
Introduction ""I see my path, but I don't know where it leads. Not knowing where I'm going is what inspires me to travel it."" -Rosalia de Castro ""Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover."" -Mark Twain It is mountains like this that makes mountaineering such an exciting part of my life. When I heard that I had an opportunity to climb Mount Logan, I instantly knew that this was something special. My family and friends were telling me that they had never known anyone who wanted to go on as many adventures as me. My feet were still blister from all the climbing I had done during July, but when offered a great opportunity, there is no way that I can decline. After all this is my passion. The weather had not gotten any better after Jack Mountain which is usual for the state of Washington. Even after halting the climbing date for Mount Logan, there was a point which we had to take a chance, hope for the best and go for it. This turned out to be a great decision. Yem came over to my house late in the day in order to get to the trailhead by night and get a early start for the hike though the Thunder Creek Valley. I had never packed so much food for a single trip before, but knew it would be necessary. Day 1: Hiking through the Thunder Creek Valley Ruby Mountain with Clouds In the morning it was a cloudy day with some views of the mountains we could see through the trees. We started hiking from the Colonial Creek Trailhead at 6:45 a.m. along the Thunder Creek Trail. We were in for a 15 mile day with heavy backpacks, but at least much of the terrain was relatively flat. Along the way we crossed over Thunder Creek using the bridge provided (the creek is like a river) and saw many wild flowers along the way. Unfortunately we did not see many mountains because there would either be trees in the way or there would be too much cloud cover. The one bad thing about the thunder creek hike is that many of the miles feel the same with traveling through the same woods mile after mile. But at least I'm in the mountains with good company, fresh air, and am on a great adventure. Foresty Spot Lights Purple Flower White Flowers Walking through the Forest One of the Many Creeks Along the way there were many creeks which I had to be careful for because I was wearing approach shoes that get wet easy, and I could not afford to make my blisters any worse than they were for this trip. We did take a few breaks along the way, although setting down the pack was pleasant on my shoulders, I was not a fan of all the mosquitoes when trying to get a bite to eat or drink. But it's to be expected during the month of July in the mountains. Tricouni Peak with Clouds It's neat to think that during the month of July I been in the mountains so often that it felt completely normal for me, almost as if it was a life style. Most people when making it to the top of a mountain are in a hurry to go back home and go about there daily lives, for me it's more the opposite. I find the life style of the city for me to be too dull and unattractive. Although I will admit after a while I do at times miss my family and friends, so I try not to be constantly in the mountains the entire summer, although perhaps most of the time. Log Crossing Thunder Valley Waterfall on Tricouni Peak Nice Log Crossing Half Way to Parks Creek Pass After reaching the part of the trail called ""Junction"", we are at the half way point to Parks Creek Pass. From here we travel a little ways further only to reach a part of the trail which we have to loose a 1,000 feet of elevation. The thought that comes to mind is ""wow, won't this be fun on the way back out"". After going down to the valley floor we soon come to our camp site which is called Skagit Queen. From here we enjoy a nice dinner of hot chocolate, tea, salami, cheese, and top romen. That night I slept very good after about 15 or so miles of travel. Skagit Queen Camp Day 2: Traveling into Snowy Lands Deer Near our Camp In the morning I woke up to a deer traveling around our tent as well as a squirrel running away as I got up. By the end of the previous day it had actually looked as though it would clear up, but over night it had gotten cloudy again. We got a late start at about 10:15 a.m. in the morning, the trail was in good condition although there was a few trees in the trail that we had to go over. While switch backing along the trail we came across an old mining house as well as a old pine line that went through many of the switch backs. As we got further in the valley we came across our first encounter of snow, this was a ideal place to leave the shoes behind and swap to climbing boots. There were many places where avalanche debris was covering the trail, although some dry patches of trail. Mushrooms on the Tree Avalanche Debris After this the valley vegetation increased dramatically making the environment look semi jungle like. From here we came across the thunder creek crossing, I was not in favor for getting my feet wet. We went a little ways back and found a nice log crossing, we had to do the old fashion sit and edge our way across. At one point my shorts got caught on it which slightly ripped them, but it was better than not using the log. The easy way across Mount Logan's Towering False Summit Park Creek Pass Now we were close to the Thunder Basin Stock Camp, we took a nice break and had to make a decision whether to go all the way to Parks Creek Pass or take a short cut and go straight up the mountain. We finally decided to take the more direct route and follow along the right side of the towering false summit (Point 8,000). Going into the Brush At first it was a little brushy entering into the woods, but as soon as we got onto the lower slope of Mount Logan, things became much nicer... or at least for the first few hundred feet. As we climbed up we used veggie belays and such to help keep us stable on the slope. Sometimes the ice axe would get caught, but even worse was when one of my backpack straps would get caught which I would have to maintain balance until I got it untangled. As we climbed higher we came across mini cliff bands and steep sections that made traveling tedious, it got to the point where I started to wonder if we would reach a point where we could not climb any higher. Crawling through a Tree After doing a bit of navigation we managed to get through without anything too dangerous. We went up a little ways further to the left and now where out of the woods and nearing the Fremount basin. Finally into a Clearing Rolling Mist On the Upper Snowfield Entering the Basin Evening on Logan Marsh Marigold Dark Sky Rising Clouds Primus Peak The clouds all around were getting darker which did not seem like a sign of the weather getting better any time soon. From here we hiked up the basin to a flat area around 8,000 feet high. As I broke trail it began to rain a little, further up the winds were picking up and it became colder. Keep in mind I was still in a t-shirt and shorts, but now I was on a slope that was a little steep to be taking off my pack, plus we were almost to our destination of the day. As the wind was blowing it suddenly changed to snow which my arms and legs were getting quite cold by this point. Once I got to the top of the hill I had to put on everything that I had to regain warmth. I had a hard time putting on my gear because my hands were becoming numb and I had to be careful about clothes blowing away. A moment later we found a flat spot which was great for setting up camp. Snowing on the Tent After stomping around for a while on the snow to make a flat spot for the tent, Yem started up cooking for dinner. Looking all around I couldn't help but feel as though I was in a winter wonderland. The sky was getting dark, and the fog continuously would pour in from the valley below. Only for a split second could we faintly made out Mount Logan through the clouds, it then went back to the same old cloudy views. After dinner we finally went into the tent to make attempts to sleep that did not come easy. As we talked I could see the flashing of lightning above, I was a bit worried but they seemed distant. After a while we finally fell asleep. Day 3: Going for the SummitWaking up early in the morning the weather had not improved one bit, we decided that it would be best to wait out the storm before making a summit bid, even if that meant crossing the glacier late in the day. I rolled around a bit having a hard time going back to sleep only to realize that my air mattress was popped which is why I could feel a lump in my back. But it was still better than being at home. A few hours later I woke up seeing that it looked bright outside the tent, for a moment I was excited. When looking outside it was once again just bright fog with a few minor clearings from time to time. Eventually we got out of the tent when I spotted a clearing in the sky which raised hopes for some views. For about 30 or so seconds Mount Logan came into view which I frantically took some photos of the view. Light Dusting of Snow on Logan Temporary View of Mount Logan's Summit And then back to the same old cloudy view. After watching the clouds for an hour, Yem and I noticed there was a pattern with how the clouds would blow in. First you would see a few holes, then a view of a few peaks, and then back to being socked in. Then it would repeat itself again. The Boston Glacier through the Fog Looking at my food supplies I realize that we have to summit today, plus I had another adventure lined up as soon as I got off this mountain. The mountain itself had not come back into view, so in a sense I was taking two risks if we went for it. 1: Not being able to see exactly where we need to go. 2: We risked not getting the incredible view of Logan from the summit. At the end of one of the clearings we finally decided that it was worth a shot, so we packed up our climbing gear, put on our harnesses, and made way for the summit. It was 3 p.m. when we finally left camp. I was in lead which now all I could see was the lower face of Mount Logan with clouds all around and my partner. I knew from a earlier clearing that there were two gullies, which I went for the first one on the right assuming that it was the cross over spot for the ridge. After traveling up a snow slope we reached the bottom of it, it looked like class 4+ all the way up with a lot of exposure. Yem and I were not pleased with how it looked, we even saw a foot print in the dirt which seemed like evidence that it might be the route. ""Hang on a second, perhaps there is another way"" Yem finally announced. I decided to pull out my camera and look at former photographs that I took earlier in the day. Remarkably it helped us figure out where we were, and where we needed to go. After down climbing off of the steep section, Yem suggested that I stay high on the snow ridge. This turned out to be a very good idea. As we travel along the ridge, it felt as through we were constantly going to the right. Almost as if it was endless. It was at this moment that I thought of a quote ""I see my path, but I don't know where it leads. Not knowing where I'm going is what inspires me to travel it"". It was exciting traveling the ridge, faintly through the fog I could see it glowing. Pretty soon I came across what appeared to be a cornice, when deciding to travel on it to my relief it was the hogsback. We were officially on the route again. The Hogsback a Few hours after getting to the base of it (after the fog cleared) From here we climbed over the Hogsback and on to a section where we had to cross over the ridge. We took off our crampons and left our ice axes to save weight. We knew that any snow on the east face would be too treacherous to be traveling on which is what made leaving gear a acceptable choice. Once we crossed over onto the east side of Mount Logan the terrain suddenly became quite rugged, I'll admit that for a few minutes I became a bit nervous. After finding some good scramble spots I became comfortable again, this was perhaps the best class 3-4 terrain I have ever been on. Despite the exposure, the rock was remarkably solid. After making a few careful moves and looking back down, I smiled in excitement. The climb was on. The Section just before Crossing over onto the East Face The First Climbing Section Once past this section it became flat with a bit of exposure. We carefully traversed this spot and came to a snow field. Yem announced that it would be best to stay as much to the left as possible to avoid the snow. From here it looked like we were virtually at the summit. But like many mountains when fog covered, it was a teaser summit. Misty Summits Going around the Snowfield One of the Many Gullies Below Pink Flowers Yem and I had to do a bit of a down climb move to continue along the ridge, but fortunately there was not a whole lot of exposure here. From here there was one last traverse with a scramble ending with more fun moves. We were officially on the summit. I was in awe that we had made it. Down Climb Section Views from the Summit Looking Back at the Summit It was getting late in the day, so we decided to spend only enough time on the summit to have a quick snack and mini celebration. Going down was much easier than I had expected. On our way down we could see clouds rising in fast motion, and soon enough we got a major clearing. Brocken Spectre The False Summit Clearing Up The Ridge through the Clouds Mount Goode through the Clouds The Views to the South This was the moment we had been waiting for all along, the views of mountains kept pouring in through the clouds. It was more beautiful than if it had been clear skies all day. When crossing over the ridge I could see that the Hogsback was glowing brightly with a ultra contrast lighting to it. ""It doesn't get much better than this"" I whispered to myself as I descend onto the slope below. In the Dark Shadows of Mount Logan The Views Below the Mountain Looking Down the Hogs Back Yem heading down the Hogsback Cross over Spot When we Backed Down Tracks going to the Route From here it was a easy descent back to our camp which this time we got to travel on mostly flat terrain due to us being able to see where we were going. At camp Yem boils the water for my top romen, when it finally cooled down I got to enjoy the sunset with glowing peaks with tasty warm food. This in my mind was an example of a moment of perfection in the mountains. We took photos until our hands became too cold from the cool air, and we then went to sleep feeling great from an amazing day. The Views to the Southwest Alpenglow on Mount Logan Clearing Mountains Eldorado with Rising Clouds Sunset over the Clouds Yem watching the Sunset Bright Shining Clouds Sun Setting over Primus Primus Peak with Clouds Fire Across the Sky Primus Peak after Sunset Beautiful Eldorado Peak Alpenglow on Bonanza Peak Evening View from Camp Day 4: The long journey HomeIn the morning I woke up around 5 a.m. Normally when this tired I would go back to sleep, but I very much wanted to see the sunrise. So I put on my boots and scrambled up a few hundred feet to get views of Jack Mountain as well as a few others. Then I went back down to camp to see the rest of the views during the sunrise. Sunrise on Eldorado, Klawatti, and Primus Peak Sunrise on Buckner Mountain Above the Clouds in the Morning Sunrise Colors on Jack Mountain Sunrise on Eldorado Peak Sunrise on Ripsaw Ridge Boston Peak Alpenglow Sahale Mountain Forbidden Peak Primus Peak Morning View of Mount Logan Sunrise on Klawatti Peak Brooker Mountain Boston and Sahale Mountain From here we knew that we had a long day ahead of us with over 20 more miles of traveling left. After breakfast we packed up camp, refilled water at a near by creek and were ready to go. I'll admit the descent was a bit hard on my ankles and knees because of the crampons on the hard snow on steep slopes. Below us were still come lingering clouds in the valley below, ironically now I was wishing for some cloud cover to help made going back a bit cooler. After all there are not a lot of views from the woods even when there is no cloud in the sky. Heading Down the Fremount Basin Going towards Park Creek Pass Eldorado Peak during Late Morning Once we were near the pass, Yem decided to take a short cut down one of the side gullies. This turned out to save us time, although it had an interesting section near the bottom. It was a little bit difficult with crampons on, we had to travel over a tree with a mini water fall that had to be avoided. Looking Down the Mini Waterfall Yem Down Climbing using the Tree Misty Forest Down Below   Snake in the Woods  Hiking Back Up HillFrom here it was a walk down to the basin where Thunder Creek began to form. We took off our crampons here and took a rest. Looking at my food supplies I found that I had a limited amount of food, but enough to make it back home. At first finding the trail was a bit difficult because of all the avalanche debris, but as we got further down the valley we found it. A few miles further down the trail we came to my approach shoes which I was pleased because this meant that I did not have to wear my blistering boots. But at the same time I was disappointed that they were soaking wet from the rain the previous days. To make the trip quicker we ran down some of the down hill sections. Many miles later of traveling through the woods we finally reach the part that we all dreaded. The 1,000 feet of elevation gain. This was certainly one of the hardest parts of the trip, plus the fact that it was hot out did not make things easier. After pressing on for hundreds of feet up the hill, I was becoming quite tired by this point, as well as my shoulders hurting (I know, I sound like a complainer. But I want the audience to know that just because it was the way back doesn't mean it was easy). Cornices across the Valley Jungle Like View Tricouni Peak After another mile or so we reached Junction, from here we decided to cook our last meal of the trip. Unfortunately not only were there lots of mosquitoes, but there were lots of black flies. I kept getting bite marks all over my legs (even a week later they were still itchy). This made it hard to sit in one place during lunch. As soon I was done, I was wanting out of Junction to get away from the bugs. For the next 9 miles we ran down the mountain, I'll admit it was a bit monotonous, but I was still having fun. After more hours of walking through the woods we finally reach the trailhead. ""Finally I can rest"" I announced as I take a bite into a cookie that I had a stash saved up for me for the ride home. As I start to fall asleep I realize ""My adventure is not yet over, tomorrow I have a climb for Vesper Peak, and the next day Mount Rainier"". I smile at the thought that I am having an amazing summer with never ending adventures.

But I plan on going on more trips soon. I would love to go to Yukon, but the passport deal is what is preventing me. As it is I have difficulties paying for my trips (and gear) which I spend just about every ounce of my cash on. But in the future I certainly plan on doing major climbs.

single-day,"An 18 Hour Day On Eldorado Peak
March 6, 2010 First Light on J-burg Inspired by Steph Abegg's recent trip report, EastKing and I started discussing the possibility of heading up to Eldorado ourselves to give the mountain our best shot. Eldorado has been on my to do list for a few years now but I've felt a little trepidation about that famous knife edge finish to the summit. Seeing Steph's photograph of the unusually wide east ridge settled things in my mind. I wanted to climb this peak while the upper reaches were covered in fresh snow. We decided If we got another break in the weather. Eldorado would be our goal. We hoped to do this trip the last weekend in February but with increasing avalanche danger we went to North Chiwaukum and Middle Chiwaukum instead. Fortunately, the following weekend provided the weather we had hoped for and also very low avalanche danger. Leaving my house at 1130pm Friday night, we drove to the trailhead. I knew that most people did Eldorado as a two day climb to break up the 6700+ feet of vertical gain. But I felt confident that with an early enough start, we could do it in a day. There would be six of us making two rope teams of 3 for crossing the Eldorado Glacier and the Inspiration Glacier. Eldorado Creek Drainage Dave, Greg (SP member EastKing), and I met Josh, Mark, and Michael at the trailhead in the middle of the night and were moving through the dense forest by 3 AM. Later I would wish we had started earlier. The first obstacle was crossing the Cascade River. We found the log jam which is the common crossing point but to our dismay we found that it was covered with a thin layer of icy frost. Nobody fell in the river but to keep from slipping we had to use extra care. It has been noted in the past that finding the start of the actual trail is not easy. This is true. I think we were actually bushwhacking for some time before anything like a trail opened up in front of us. The trail, which contours the west side of Eldorado Creek, was steep and difficult to follow in the dark using only our headlamps. This was the third or fourth climb I had done without changing my headlamp batteries so they weren't quite up to par. Upper Eldorado Creek Basin At some point we broke out of the trees and immediately we found ourselves climbing steep crusty snow. The real nightmare about this part of the route was giant talus sprawled about on this steep slope intermixed with half-melted snow. There were wide moats around nearly all the boulder sized talus rocks. This combination of jagged rocks, thin snow formations, and deep crevices was a perfect recipe for a twisted ankle or broken leg. Thankfully it didn't come to that. Higher up we reached slopes that were fully snow covered and predawn light started spilling into the valleys. The most impressive view from this approach was the imposing giant which is Johannesburg Mountain, known locally as J-burg. A summer view of this peak is impressive enough with its many cliffs and hanging glaciers. Seeing it's north face in the winter covered in snow flutings was no less impressive. The sun came up and dramatically changed the colors on J-burg. Getting Tired The East Ridge Reaching the top of the Eldorado Creek drainage we faced an enormous headwall. At this point it would be necessary to climb over the ridge to the west and drop down into the Roush Creek drainage. There were plenty of recent slides visible that had come off of this ridge but none of them looked very big and most had probably happened in the late afternoon, after hours of sunshine. We made it to the ridge top and at this point Dave (SP member) decided to throw in the towel and head back to the car. He had my full sympathy because he had worked a twelve hour day, then without rest he had driven all through the night from his house in Wenatchee to pick us up in Edmonds, 3.5 hours (135 miles), and then from there drove another 3 hours (110 miles) to the trailhead. So on top of all that, the 4000 feet of gain to the ridge top had just taken too much out of him. At this point, rather than having a tired climber descend over some dangerous spots alone, EastKing volunteered to go down with him. It was a difficult choice but a very honorable one. He later told me that Dave took a fall in bad place and could have been injured and in trouble if he had been alone. On The East Ridge The ""Knife Edge"" The remaining four of us dropped down off the ridge and found a nice flat spot to rope up. Although we weren't on the Eldorado Glacier yet, we would be soon enough. Mark (SP member) led for awhile and when he got tired, Josh at the other end of the rope took over. After an hour or so we reached the flat plateau which marked the edge of the Inspiration Glacier which is the third largest in the North Cascades. Now the summit and east ridge were literally in our faces. Looking up at the sun I had my doubts about whether or not we would have time to summit. Nobody had remembered to bring a watch and from the looks of it, it was getting late. We decided to go at least as far as the base of the ridge and see how long that took to get there. Once we were there, without pausing we continued to climb higher and higher. Josh was doing a good job leading but as things iced up in a few spots I recommended that we all take our snowshoes off and this made it much easier. We also untied from the rope since the ridge top was not part of the glacier. The Summit The Summit It took a long time but we made it to the bottom of the ""knife edge"" and found it to be just as wide as Steph's picture had shown. In minutes were all rejoicing on the summit. At number 25, Eldorado is one of Washington highest mountains. We knew that climbing it in a single day and also with early spring snow was something to be proud of. Mark freely admitted that it was the hardest thing he had ever done. I felt very happy to have assisted two 17 year olds to the summit of one of the Cascades most famous peaks. Everyone on the rope had proven their strength and stamina. Now it was time to get down, as fast as safely possible. As much as I regretted it, I sort of became a drill sergeant to keep everyone moving. I put time limits on breaks and constantly reminded everyone to keep up the pace. We made it off the glaciers without incident and thankfully Michael (SP member) offered to carry the rope down which I had carried up. When we crossed over the ridge back into the Eldorado Creek drainage we found that a few hours of shade had formed a new hard crust on the snow. So much for those long glissades we had hoped for. As a consolation prize, neighboring Sahale Mountain was lit up with alpenglow. Dark was fast approaching now. I wanted to get past the nasty steep snowy talus before nightfall. We did not make it in time. The Summit The snow conditions deteriorated to the worst I have ever seen. There was a hard crust on top from the cool night air but below that were several feet of unconsolidated snow which had been softened throughout the day. For awhile it was too steep to wear our snowshoes. Many times I would take a step and then sink in all the way to my waist. When were finally able to put on our snowshoes, we still found ourselves sinking in to our knees. Yuck! Strap failures on the snowshoes caused us to stop for frequent breaks. I tried to remain calm while I thought about the evening I wanted to spend with my girlfriend Sarah slipping away. Among the talus slopes we came to a steep drop -off. Remembering the way we had come up this section I decided it wouldn't be any better to try to find the exact spot. I chose a class three gully with plenty of rocks to hold onto. There was no snow in this gully but it was steep and the rocks were wet and down sloping. I went down first and then held my breath while the other guys came down one at a time. I knew that there was real potential for injury at this point, especially since we were doing it in the dark. I felt real relief when we were all down unscathed and I knew the worst was over when Mark found the trail. Sahale Mountain Alpenglow The rest of the way we did our best to stay on track. When we came to the Cascade River we didn't even bother looking for the log crossing. Wet and exhausted, we just walked through the water, letting it fill our boots. By 9 PM, Dave and Greg at the cars were a welcome sight.

As it should be known I turned back with Dave. Dave was extremely tired due to not sleeping for 24 hours. So at 6250 just before going down the ridge to start the main part of the climb he wisely called it there. I was a little tired and probably would have been the slower person here but could have continued. But my gut here was not feeling so good about Dave going down alone here. He has a ton more experience than I did but conditions below did not look good in the lowest talus field. I was also concerned about the avalanche danger on the mountain slope. To me this was a safety first decision to head back down with mtn.climber. It was a very wise decision for be to stay back. Josh , Mark , and Mike was with Gimpilator, a man I would trust my life with and they all roped up on the climb. I knew that they were in good hands and were one of the few groups that have actually roped one for the glacier travel required to ascend Eldorado. I was also able to give some in the group extra water for there long ascent to the summit. At the lower talus field Dave took tripped and fell to the edge of an 8 foot cliff that probably would not have killed him but would have broke some bones if he fell. Luckily he stopped himself before that fall but if it had been one more foot he would have been injured and without me could have been in a bad situation alone 2000 up on a mountain. At least with me there, there were plenty of options! I wouldn't live with myself if he got injured and I wasn't there to help him! Safety first is my motto and I will live by that no matter what. Summits are always a distant third, even if was Eldorado in peak conditions. gimpilator - Mar 10, 2010 12:08 pm - Hasn't voted Re: What happened with EastKing and Dave Thanks Greg for sharing these details with us.

single-day,"Reality Check on Pica Peak
The beginning of the climb On Pica Peak Fine fall dayA few weeks ago, Fred went up to the Washington Pass area, near the Liberty Bell group, to climb Wallaby Peak and Copper Point, while I was caring for a friend who had had surgery. He spied a nice looking peak that sits between Copper Point and Early Winter Spire. It looked like it might be a good climb with a short approach. According to the Beckey guide, it is Pica Peak (labeled only as 7565 on the USGS quad sheet). Subsequent research also came up with an alternate name of Poster Peak. Its east ridge route is locally known as Blue Buttress and depending on which trip report you read, this is either a fabulous climb or sort of a dog, anywhere from 5.3 to 5.7 and anywhere from 9 to 12 pitches. Great weather was forecast this past weekend and since we are back teaching college, it’s hard to get away for anything long, so we thought to give this climb a shot. Saturday morning just past 7 a.m. we were parked at the hairpin turn east of Washington Pass and headed up the trail. One has to leave the trail early and take a long ascending traverse over talus, boulders, steep trees and heather. It is a bit of a grunt, but 1½ hours later, we were at the base of the climb. For the Cascades, this is a short approach. The climbing goes well although it isn't that great. The number of trees and loose rock further lessen the appeal. We realize that the widely diverging opinions and descriptions of this climb are founded in the many options existing on which way to go. One short section we walked, but overall the climbing was in the low to mid Class 5 range and we alternated leads. The fall About 1 or 2 pitches below the fall - but the scenario pretty much looked like this!About 4 pitches from the summit, Fred led up a slab. He had placed three pieces of protection: a small wired stopper, a sling around a tree and an old Friend in a crack. He was about 70 feet out and complaining that the rock was poor and friable. He had thought to place another piece but no good opportunities existed, so he opted to continue up a bit further and grabbed a large slab of rock. He had hardly touched it when there was a loud crack and the rock seemingly exploded off, knocking Fred backward. Granite weighs about 165 lbs per cubic foot. By Fred’s estimation this slab was 3 feet by 2 feet by 8 inches thick – so about 700 lbs. The next thing I see is Fred, the big rock, and numerous smaller rocks falling toward me. Fred tumbles one way, but the rock continues towards me and I think, “If that hits me I am toast!” I have a death grip on the rope and feel Fred’s weight suddenly wrench on me, but I am also watching the rock, preparing to duck. My dad’s words echo in my head: “Wait until it is close before ducking. You never know which way rocks will go.” The large slab does indeed bounce off to the side and hurtles between me and Fred down the mountain. Smaller, but equally lethal rocks continue on. I am able to dodge most of them. One lands harmlessly on my pack, one grazes my helmet but crams it down on my head pretty hard. My helmet is left with a pretty good gouge in it. Fred remembers the crack when the rock let go, then it momentarily resting against him before violently pushing him back. The next thing he knows, he’s hanging upside down with lots of air below him. All this in the space of perhaps 3 to 5 seconds, at most. Fred has fallen about 30 feet – he had been about 15 feet above the Friend – and to the side in a shallow gully. He is hanging upside down, arms stretched above his head and he is not moving. Oh Shit… “Fred are you all right?” I scream. To my vast relief he immediately responds, “Yea, I’m fine”. He tries to right himself, but his right foot is caught under the rope. I carefully lower him to a small stance where he is able to get his foot out and he stands up. I am relieved to see no blood on his head, he obviously has an intact spinal cord and all his other parts seem to be working. He carefully checks himself. Suddenly he breaks out in a grin, leans forward, and from beneath a pile of rocks pulls his favorite blue cap. It however, has two large tears in it. Fred’s pants are also shredded in several places. BFF Once we get past the initial shock, Fred continues up, but not before taking several pictures of his now BFF: Best Friend Forever. I am impressed that the Friend held so well, as the fall was to the side rather than down the fall line of the rope. It was damaged and will need to be retired. The rope didn’t come out unscathed either – two cuts into the sheath. The rope is about 6 years old and held such a hard fall, it is also being retired. After we got home, careful inspection of my helmet plus its age has made me decide to replace it as well. Since we were far closer to the summit than the bottom, it was best to finish the climb. From the summit we were in two hours back to the car. Fred was starting to stiffen up. My back hurt a bit and my belay hand was sore and bit banged up. However, neither of us has any complaints – we were damned lucky with respect to the falling rock. AftermathI have caught Fred and other people several times on lead. The usual fall while on lead provides at least some sort of warning or indication that it is about to happen and it doesn’t normally include almost a quarter of a ton of granite. The sudden violence of this fall was absolutely astounding. Many have become blasé if not downright arrogant about climbing fourth and lower fifth class unroped. Simul-climbing is an increasingly popular technique. If Fred and I had been doing either, at least one if not both of us would probably be dead - especially if we had been simul-climbing. I am convinced that we both would have fallen, doubling (or more) the strain on the system, perhaps to failure. By being in a conventional belay, I could hang on to Fred and duck. Even if I had been hit, I had stopped Fred before the first rocks arrived, so if I had let go, I think he might have been able to catch himself on trees – and he certainly would have been stopped by the belay anchor, which was a rope sling around a big burly tree. If there was any criticism, it was that Fred was not wearing a helmet, a point he readily concedes. Fred ended up with only some severe bruising and scrapes. Luckily, the slab did not hit him during the fall after initially pushing him off the rock. It was large enough to have done some very serious damage if it had. Please, folks, err on the side of safety. If the consequence of a fall, regardless how caused, is serious injury or death, belay it, no matter how easy is seems. And if you belay, do it right. As a friend in Austria once said to me, “Better to be a coward for a second than dead a life time”.

multi-day,"A Bonanza Extravaganza!
PROLOGUESummiting Bonanza Peak has been in my thoughts for quite some time. It is not only the highest non-volcanic mountain in Washington, it is also considered to require a range of mountaineering skills to summit. Just thinking about the peak has kept me up some nights, and caused me to shiver with both anticipation and concern at some other times. Bonanza Peak Since I first seriously began considering attempting the Washington County Highpoints during the past two years, Bonanza Peak has been in the forefront of my mountaineering goals yet in the background of my mountaineering reality. I knew a successful summit attempt would require not only confidence in my own abilities but also require having a good team, good route conditions, and good weather. ""Gimpilator"" Adam, myself, and our mountaineering friend Dave had a successful summit trip at Mount Olympus during the first week of July. We worked very well as a team during that trip, with each teammate having a lot of mountaineering skills but each person also having a specific strong skill to add to the team. My strong skill was planning and navigation, Gimpilator's strong skill was glacier travel, and Dave's strong skill was rock climbing. The team worked so well together that we were hoping to have similar success on Bonanza Peak the following week... DAY ONE: The Trip To High CampAfter spending the previous night in Chelan, Washington, we drove to the ferry dock at the southern end of Lake Chelan during the early morning of July 10. We caught the ""Lady of the Lake II"" passenger ferry, which we would be aboard for three hours while en route to a stop at Lucerne. Lucerne was once an old port and homestead location along Lake Chelan, and offered the easiest, most direct access to the old mining town of Holden Village. For many years, with the old mining operations long since ceased, Holden Village has since become a Lutheran camp and facility, but the public is welcome to use their daily bus transportation between the village and Lucerne. While at Holden we checked into the ""Hike Haus"" (climbers register) and cached what looked to be unnecessary gear there. We encountered two peakbagging acquaintances, Franklin and Carla, while at the village. We spoke with them for quite a while, before we finally began hiking at 2:00 PM. A deer led us out of the village, before stopping to forage. Our Team At Holden Village Deer Foraging Near Holden The hike to Holden Lake was fairly uneventful. The trail was in excellent condition, the weather was great, and we had time on our side. Within the final 0.25-0.50 miles to the lake we started encountering snow, which we would be traveling on for the rest of our ascent to Holden Pass. Traveling around the lake to its northern end was mostly a combination of swampy crossings, slide alder bushwhacks, and questionable snow bridges. Fortunately, once we were at the northern end of Holden Lake our route became an obvious ascent up snowy slopes along the right side of slide alder forests and snowmelt streams. Log Jam Along Trail Holden Lake Bonanza Peak, As Seen From Holden Lake Snowy Route From Holden Lake As we approached the final snowy slopes to Holden Pass we could see an abundance of waterfalls below the Mary Green Glacier. However, there were fewer waterfalls than we had seen in photos, largely due to the amount of snowpack still remaining on the glacier and mountain slopes. After we found a nice flat area (~6400' elevation) for our tent only a short distance above Holden Pass, we began assessing possible routes for passing through or around the waterfall section. Our Bonanza Campsite Waterfall Ledges Below Mary Green Glacier During our ascent we had found one possible snowy ramp near one nearby waterfall, but once at our campsite we found a snowy slope leading up to the ridge above and seemingly bypassing the waterfall section. Dave scouted out the snowy slope while Adam gathered water and I shoveled out parts of our campsite. Dave returned with good news; the snowy slope apparently led all the way to the glacier, unobstructed except for one very brief walk up a minor rocky ramp and through a couple of evergreen trees. Plus, it appeared the waterfalls could be avoided completely. That was better news than we originally anticipated, as some people consider the waterfall section to be the crux of Bonanza Peak ascents. DAY TWO, PART I: The Glacier ClimbWe woke shortly before 4:00 AM on July 11. After eating some breakfast and double-checking our gear, we began hiking at 5:15 AM. The beginning of the ascent went very well. Dave's assessment for the beginning of the route was totally correct, and this certainly eliminated the need for spending a lot of time routefinding. Once atop a snowy ledge at ~6700' elevation, we ascended uphill until below a large rock cliff, which we then side-traversed along until reaching a basin located above most of the lower waterfalls. From the basin we began to angle uphill for a while, heading towards the northeastern end of the Mary Green Glacier. Approaching The Glacier... Sunrise! Shortly before reaching what we thought might be the edge of the glacier we encountered one steep rocky section with some easy ramps switchbacking up to the very steep snow slope above it. Or, at least we thought those were easy ramps; Dave slipped near the bottom of the rocks and hit his nose and mouth on a boulder, giving him a partial fat lip. He recovered fairly quickly, and we continued. Once atop the rocky slope, we briefly ascended the steep snowy slope above it until reaching a gentle slope on which we could rope-up for the glacier travel ahead. Shadow Of Our Team On The Glacier Travel along the Mary Green Glacier was surprisingly easy. The amount of deep snowpack filled and covered any crevasses that may have existed along the northern traverse. Although, with that said, we saw plenty of crevasses and seracs towards the southern end of the glacier. We traversed by and through some remnants of some avalanches and cornice-breaks, but those dangers had long since ceased before our visit. Crossing Mary Green Glacier Ice Blocks On Glacier We carefully ascended the steep snow thumb that winds west and then north to a large bergschrund. Considering the amount of snowpack still present on the mountain, I was shocked to find the bergschrund (~8600' elevation) nearly completely opened. We each crossed the bergschrund, one person at a time, needed to take a small step of faith to cross. Ascending Snow Thumb... Bergschrund On Upper Snow Thumb The glacier climb was complete. Now came the hard part. We just did not anticipate how hard the final 900' of vertical gain would be. DAY TWO, PART II: The Rock ClimbThe standard route typically requires Class 3 scrambling, with some brief sections of Class 4 terrain, starting at a large gully above the bergschrund. Unfortunately, due to the near-record snowpack this year the entire gully was covered in snow. There were numerous cracks and moats seen within the snow, as well, making any attempt to use the standard approach a likely futile and possibly deadly choice. We knew some people who had summited Bonanza Peak the previous week with even more snow pack, by ascending up steep slopes, many of which were snow-covered, to the summit. Unfortunately for our team, the conditions had since changed. Looking up the peak, the gentler, more-standard slopes contained a combination of steep snow gullies, icy underlayers, and minor snowmelt streams. This left us with one viable choice: Have a roped rock climb up one of the main rappel routes. We quickly realized that the remainder of the trip would make-or-break depending upon Dave. That was a lot to ask of one person, but considering his vast rock climbing expertise the conditions put our team in that situation. Ultimately, it would be Dave's decision how we would continue and if we would continue. Having already gone sofar, Dave was determined to reach the summit... but only if the entire team could safely do so. Dave Leads The Climb... Second Pitch Dave Waits While Gimpilator Climbs... Climbing The Rappel Route... Ascending Steep Snow Between Rock Climb Sections... Rock Climbing Near ~9200 Elevation Each pitch took a long time, both because of having a three-man team and because of searching for the best spots for belays and anchors. Slowly but surely, after several steep snow ascents and nine pitches, we final reached the final summit ridge. This ascent was extremely time-consuming yet as safe as we could be under the circumstances. Once at the summit ridge, Adam followed the brief rocky knife-edge ridge up to a final steep, exposed snow slope to the summit, followed by Dave and then me. We did not use a rope for that final summit ridge, although the amount of occasional exposure made us consider it. Although the final slope was snow-covered, the summit itself was rocky. We found the register box, which only contained a single paper within it. Atop The ""25' Vertical Class 4 Rock"" At Summit Ridge Scrambling The Summit Ridge... Northeast View From Summit Summit Pose After taking a few photos, handshakes, and a short video, we turned around to head back down. Just then, I unexpectedly began to cry. I think that was the moment I finally grasped the achievement. I suddenly realized that my quest to summit the Washington County Highpoints would likely eventually become a reality. Bonanza Peak was the highpoint I was most concerned about on that list. I still needed to summit Big Horn and Mount Baker, but neither of those two mountains are considered as physically or technically demanding as Bonanza Peak. I turned back around and shook Gimpilator's hand, thanking him for being my friend, and then headed down. Example Of Cascade Giants Seen From Bonanza Peak DAY TWO, PART III: The Long DescentWe still had plenty of daylight and good weather, but the total ascent from camp took much longer (8h30m) than any of us originally anticipated. We figured the descent would be equally as long, if not moreso. Fortunately, it was only 2:00 PM and we were hoping for a consistent yet safe series of rappels down the mountain. Considering we were basically rappeling the same route we rock climbed, we figured the descent would take nearly the same amount of time as the ascent had. Actually, it would take us nearly an hour longer. Gimpilator Rappels! Dave Rappels! Waiting For The ""OK"" To Begin Next Rappel... Redwic Rappels! We still had daylight when we reached the bergschrund (which had opened-up further during that day) and snow thumb, and after roping-up we descended to the Mary Green Glacier. The sunset occurred as we reached the glacier below the snow thumb, although there was still plenty of lingering daylight. We retraced our route until returning back to near the northeastern end of the glacier, at which point the sky darkened. I grew concerned but had put GPS waypoints and our track log into my GPS. Gimpilator started to get very tired and occasionally questioned our route, but Dave and I remembered much of the route and had our GPS devices as backups if needed. The descent seemed slow-going but was as safe as we could be. Once below the glacier and on the snowy slopes above the waterfalls, we began our long side-traverse. Suddenly, we saw a light flashing from a location along our intended descent route. We headed towards the light and found two people in a tent, camped only ~300' elevation above our camp. After a brief conversation, we continued to camp. Each one of us made it back to camp safely, both relieved and excited about what we had just achieved that day. We not only summited a technically difficult peak, but we did it using a different approach and much longer than expected. During that night, the weather took a turn for the worse, raining and hailing seemingly non-stop. The bad weather stopped by 7:30 AM, and we were ready to head back to Holden by 8:45 AM. We quickly realized that a lot of snow had melted-out that previous day. This was especially apparent between Holden Pass and Holden Lake, where most of the climbers path was visible/melted-out (which was completely snow-covered during the ascent 36 hours earlier). When we arrived back in Holden Village by noon, we celebrated with a nice meal followed by some espresso (Gimpilator, Dave) and ice cream shakes (Dave, me). We departed on the bus, being waved ""good bye"" by the Holden crowd, and headed to the ""Lady of the Lake II"" ferry. We arrived back in Chelan several hours later, and then began the long drive home from there. A Well-Deserved Rest On The Ferry EPILOGUESummiting Bonanza Peak was a major mountaineering goal for the three of us. For me, personally, it was my 37th Washington County Highpoint and the crowning achievement of that list thus far. We each needed to trust our partners, trust our skills, and trusts our instincts. We were successful in summiting the mountain, working well as a team, and getting back safely. Here are some trip statistics: -> Nine roped rock climbs/belays for the final 900' of vertical gain. -> 12 rappels for the descent of the same slopes. -> 8h30m to reach the summit from our camp at Holden Pass. Six of those hours were on the final 900' vertical feet. -> 15 minutes at the summit. -> 9h30m to reach our camp at Holden Pass from the summit. Seven of those hours were spent rappelling down to near the bergschrund. -> 18h15m total time on summit day, roundtrip.

Clearly out of all the climbs you have done, I think this is the most impressive yet. You used all the skills you needed here and the reward was an amazing summit that blows away the volcanoes. Most impressive is that you climbed the peak when the main route was out of service. I think that this climb has made you three more than strong enough to go for all on the Bulger List and maybe far greater worldwide. I hope to see you three go in that direction and knock off some great summits like Johannesburg and Terror which many just dream about. Viewing: 1-13 of 13 to post! Don't have an account?"
single-day,"Defying My Illness-A November Wake Up To The Mountains
POO POO POINT: Whoo Whoo for Poo Poo!!! (11/01/09) What I find especially engaging, charming and inspirational about Poo Poo Point is that if you are a beginning hiker, or you are just interested in getting back in shape again for any reason, or you are overweight and have 100 pounds to lose (like me) ...then Poo Poo Point is great and that is because you can meet the amazing Paragliders who walk to the top, one, two, (and some of them...I know because I asked) ...three times a day just so they can jump off and be like eagles off of the beautiful view and summit. By the way, though most hikers do not seem to flinch at the name (I guess after 200 mountains hiked, the names of mountains do not phase a person), I for one wanted to know the origin of the name of Poo Poo Point. The best I found was from the link at the end of the article that says that hikers thought it sounded like ""Poo Poo"". However, I must contest this in a friendly way. I mean, wouldn't it sound like ""Choo Choo?"" Maybe the train was congested? Or perhaps someone's dog was going to the bathroom at that time when the train sound went off? Anyway, it is certainly a topic for continued discussion. EastKing (my husband) has written many trip reports, and although I might have issues with his punctuation or grammar (I was the English major) , he is better at talking about hikes in depth from a technical standpoint. I like to write about my impressions of the hike more than anything. It is pretty major for me to even post these pics because of the fact that I usually cannot be pictured without make up. That all changed with the below pics. For me, an impression on the hike takes in the whole feel of the experience. That includes the hikers I meet along the way. It also includes the weather. It also includes the surrounding nature and foliage...like: What color were the leaves that day? Well, I can tell you that the leaves were quite bright and fall was definitely in full view through the beautiful yellow leaves. I am holding one of my favorite ones in the picture. :agree: Also, I think of things like: What do I remember most about this day in terms of the people? What I remember most were: One guy telling me ""Good job, keep it up, You can do it."" His voice (aside from EastKing's) has stayed with me since then, up the three other summits and hike that I have done. I have an amazingly supportive husband, but the kindness of strangers (especially after getting those questionable, disapproving looks from strangers after my sweat drips down) is not to be underrated. I also remember how very painful and hard this hike was...my first real hike in over a year. It was extremely difficult, but I kept pressing on. I know it is hard for some people to realize that it could be that difficult for someone to do Poo Poo, but it really was difficult and excrutiating for me. For me, what I can tell you about Poo Poo Point is that it was an amazing time for me. For me, it was very uncharacteristic to pick my husband up from his hotel and tell him I am ready for a walk, much less a hike. Well, this day, I knew I was ready. I knew I was ready to do something to reverse the depressing tide of chronic pain (from Interstitial Cystitis...read below comments) and growing obesity (Now, they are finding a massive hormonal and thyroid imbalance that may have caused some of it but not all of it.) So I told Greg we ought to do a hike and he was happy, but not sure if I was serious. I think he knew I was serious once I hit the trail. I was serious because this was the first time I did not turn around and badger him or tell him I could not do it. I was determined to keep doing it and I kept going, and going, and going. Although, I stopped a lot and I was sweating so hard that my entire head got wet from sweat and I was wearing the wrong clothes. What is great is having EastKing to stand behind me every step of the way. And to know that though he has summited Rainier, he is able to relate to his wife and understand the pain and challenges I have. I just kept thinking, ""This is the only way I am going to ever conquer my chronic pain...by proving to myself that I can do something like this."" I also grew accustomed on this trail to the ""What, you never saw a fat, sweaty, out of breath woman on a trail before"" look. So, I just smiled to myself knowing that I was indeed an oddity. I mean, the irony is as much as people are so quick to judge me for being overweight (I get the same thing at the gym) they do not realize that I am actually moving and off my butt to begin with. I found Poo Poo Point (I still find the name funny and so do others who I tell about it) to be challenging and difficult. That is coming from someone who has 100 pounds to lose. What I like about it are the many variating viewpoints, the amazing views all along the way, the switchbacks and the challenge it present as an ""easy"" trail. What is best about Poo Poo is the view. I have to say that it was pretty good. I felt at least that I had done all that backbreaking, sweaty hard work for something. NUMBER ONE DOWN! Thanks to everyone for their encouragement and support. I am fighting for my life here, to find a way to cope and manage with my pain and you have helped me be able to do that. You are all inspirational. [u][b]OTHER PERSONAL REMARKS: [/b][/u] I had this amazing energy that day. I am not sure what it was...Maybe pent up energy for months and months and months and months of being holed up in my apartment from being unemployed. Perhaps wondering if I still made a difference to anyone or anything. All I know is, that day, I wanted to make a difference for myself. I may never have the passion for hiking that EastKing does, but I do know that through hiking, I can have some life changing things happen. From the bottom of the trail, I met some paragliders who were trying to recruit me which I found endearing and laughable at the same time, considering the fact that I am afraid that my sheer weight alone would plummet me down to the ground. But these, fit, lithe types were ready to offer me to fly up with them. It was pretty neat, but I do have a fear of flying, so I told them that maybe once I get over that fear, I will do it with them. IF YOU ARE NOT OVERWEIGHT AND SEE AN OVERWEIGHT HIKE: Please be supportive. They are going through excrutiating pain, either emotionally or physically or both, just from trying to make it up the trail. So support them by saying ""Hi"" or just an encouraging word. Get out of your comfort zone. IF YOU ARE OVERWEIGHT AND WANT TO DO A TRAIL LIKE ME: Just take one step at a time. Go as slow as you want. Remember, it is a long trek and journey anyway, emotionally and spiritually, so just wear the proper gear to increase your comfort and just keep going. Ask for help when you need it. Drink water. GETTING TO POO POO POINT: Location: Take I-90 to Issaquah, take Front Street exit. Follow Front Street through the town of Issaquah. Then, Front Street turns into Hobart-Issaquah Road. Trailhead is at the paraglider area (refer to a map) . Elevation Start/End: 2000 foot overall elevation gain. Length: 4 miles round trip Source below taken from: (Google Search, ""Poo Poo Point: Result: http://www.niffgurd.com/mark/hikes/2004/june/12th/content.html Author unknown, below excerpt taken from link above) Trail Info: West end of Tiger Mountain. The point got its name from logging signals using a whistle that made a ""poo poo"" sound. The trailhead from the hang-glider area is the steeper of two routes to Poo Poo point. The trail climbs steeply and steadily all the way to the top. At the point your presented with panoramic views of Squak Mountain, Lake Samammish and Issaquah. There is also a clearing on the back side of the point with an amazing view of Mount Rainier. Little Si (SOLO!!)11/08/09 Ah, yes, talk about memorable trips...I must say that so far, Little Si remains my most memorable for several reasons: 1. The most ""I have never seen an overweight and sweaty woman panting to stay alive"" looks from people I encountered on the trail. 2. An interesting time for me as this was my first hike by myself on any trail, anywhere. So, for me, it was a pretty big deal. 3. A chance to prove to EastKing that I had built up enough motivation, for my second hike in over a year, to really be serious about saving my own life, both literally (weight loss and fitness) and figuratively (learning how to not let the pain take over my life.) 4. A chance for me to see how I would respond to a hike alone. I must say, I have done a lot of reading on Little Si and I think this mountain is underrated in terms of what it has to offer. In my conversation with a very nice person who had summited Rainier, we both agreed that Little Si has an ample amount of geographical range in terms of the changing of landscape and especially the wind. In fact, that is what really makes Little Si feel like a bigger mountain...because when you get to the top, the wind really starts blowing. Also, some people find it easy. I completely disagree. I found it very difficult, but then again, I do have a 100 pound backpack to lose. To further my point about the wind, I found this from this website, ""//www.mountsi.com/littlesi.htm, '""So now hikers tackle Little Si in the winter when the wind and/or rain seem a bit much for its popular counterpart above, or simply for a change of pace. And it makes a great hike around the holidays, being close to the city and offering a chance to get out in the weather and work off some calories. Little Si is part of the Mount Si Natural Resources Conservation Area, managed by the state Department of Natural Resources and created to preserve the area's natural ecosystems. Little Si is a real mountain and on a windy day it can feel like you're miles from nowhere, especially near the summit, which is mostly bald and exposed to the elements.""' Little Si is just a great all around hike for kids, families, friends, couples, and people like me, struggling to get hiking experience or those who are already experienced. Some observances: 1. If you don't like crowds, you may want to choose another, more solitary hike. 2. Prepare for slippery conditions in the rain as the trail is often rockier. 3. Prepare for windy conditions and chill at the top, especially anytime after October/November, as it does get cold (and I, very stupidly, did not have gloves) and prepare for adding an extra layer. 4. If you get there after 12 noon, you will have a very hard time finding parking, so get there earlier, IF you can. Also, it has an amazing view for a smaller summit, or ""dumpster dive"" as some love to say...but to me, it remains, at least for now, a difficult mountain. The most difficult one I ever did thus far SINCE I have hiked in Washington. But this is the second time I have done it. Yep, that is right, but it seemed so long since I last did it that I seemed to almost forget. I also found it very hard, as I found Poo Poo Point, but I think my body was in some sort of protest, because every step hurt and ached with the fibromyalgia and Interstitial Cystitis, but I knew I had to keep going. However, this time, it was raining the whole time with very questionable weather and I was worried as I am a new hiker and was wondering what I would do if I got stuck in the rain. Therefore, the rain made for slippery, and often scary conditions on the trail. I would recommend going when it is sunny, for sure. However, if you do go when it is raining, make sure you have good hiking boots with non slippage mechanisms. I was just simply determined to keep going. The most amusing part of the trail were the urban hikers who seemed to be extending their boardroom meeting on the trail, would section off into a cluster to discuss and banter about their workplace shenanigans, and then every time they saw me gaining on them, they would realize that they had to hurry up. I kept saying hello to them at each one of those meetups and each time I got the deer in the headlights look from, what I guess is, not seeing many overweight, sweaty women on the trail and realizing that I could not possibly gain on them! It is sort of interesting to me to gage such reactions now, since I learned on that trail not to let things bother me anymore if people were going to act that way. However, it bothered me enough on the trail to keep me going and I used my frustration to keep stepping. Now, I use those reactions to keep going, and more fodder and material for future stories. (They don't even realize they are giving me these gifts!) So, when I got to the top, I saw the group of guys and one of them managed a ""hi"" but I cannot say I encountered the friendliest crew up there. I can say that it was very satisfying to have made it to the top and to be able to tell my husband, EastKing, who had been attempting Mt. St. Helens that I was not fully committed to hiking again. It has definitely helped our relationship. And I am so grateful for the Little Si experience, with its mixture of negatives and positives ...It prepared me for future things I will experience on future trails. ABOUT LITTLE SI: From Karen Sykes, ""Hike of the Week: Little Si"", dated, December 12th, 1996 : '""Getting there ""Drive Interstate 90 and take the main North Bend exit, heading left into town. Turn right on North Bend Way and drive a couple miles to the Mount Si Road. Turn left, cross the bridge over the Snoqualmie River and park near the bridge in the marked lot. Trail detail Travel about one-quarter mile along 434th Street, passing houses and dogs of varying disposition. Respect private property; residents often complain about heavy foot traffic and dogs that hikers let run in their yards. The Department of Natural Resources' management plan calls for a new parking area and trailhead for the Little Si trail, and with luck it should be secured and open by next year. Until then, agency officials ask that you not park along the road and respect local residents' rights.""' I LET OUT BARELY A BALK ON SQUAK (11/15/09) I know, the title is corny, but come on, that is what makes it fun. In all seriousness, Squak Mountain was a lot easier than I had anticipated as East King had told me that it has a higher elevation gain. I found Squak to be pretty long for a gradually gaining in elevation trail. As with Cougar and Little Si, I found many beautiful fall leaves. (The only thing is, unless you have a phone book in the car or something heavy to compress the leaves, they dry up once you go home.) I also found it to be fun, in a sense, to just go up one long road to the top. I love how it was like one long extension of a road that reminded me of my grandfather's gravel road to his farmhouse (Almost as long!) Anyway, Squak is great for those who want to train up and get back in shape or for those who are with families or couples. I think it is great because it does not offer much in the way of obstacles on the trail, because there is no ""trail"" to speak of, but there is challenge in the sense that it is a strong workout and it is long. (For a ""small"" trail.) I like Squak Mountain because it is certainly not a traditional hike. I must say that I wished that it did have a better view. I really wished that when I got to the top, it had a better view. As usual, I sweated a lot and had a lot of pain going up. Many times I had to stop and sort of face my demons, really face the fact that what I want is to make this mountain but that I have extreme pain and really face the fact that my pain is severe and that it will be a real fight to do any mountain at this point. Conditions can get cold, as we noticed (me and EastKing), especially close to the top, especially if it is after October/November and especially if all you have is a rain jacket (like me.) So, just like with Little Si, these are ""smaller"" mountains, but you still need to bring your layers and make sure you have the proper footing. I recommend going earlier in the day on a nicer, sunnier day as it can get quite wet and cold if you leave later in the day. Of course, it depends on you, as some do not mind hiking in the rain. This was my third greatest accomplishment this month, and it was with Squak that I knew I had changed the tide of something in my life and that I was at least committing to myself, if nobody else, the importance of caring about myself and about fitness and about conquering this monster called Interstitial Cystitis (chronic bladder inflammation.) I am lucky, as usual, to have supportive hiking partner in my husband. Long Live Squak! LOOKING FOR SHY BEAR ON WILDERNESS PEAK (COUGAR MOUNTAIN (11/21/09) Cougar Mountain was to mark my fourth entryway into a new life for myself and not allowing chronic pain to control my life. By this time, I was starting to feel like an Issaquah Alps expert. Aside from the fact that I have been wanting to move to Issaquah since I moved here (Just have not been able to afforde it) I feel repeatedly drawn to the area. I think what is incredible about Cougar Mountain and surrounding areas are the sheer number of possibilities there are for outdoor recreation. And also, the leaves are quite beautiful and varied on this trail. It also reminded me of various hikes I did with EastKing in New Hampshire when I had been in much better shape. I had thought Cougar Mountain would have a much better view with the fact that a whole area is named after it. I was disappointed to find that I worked hard, huffing and puffing and that the view was not there. However, it was nice to encounter other friendly hikers on this day and to go across the neat, little bridges that I saw along the way. This is from,' ""http://www.weekendhike.com/2008/05/cougar-mountain-wilderness-cliffs-trail.html.""As you reach the top of Wilderness Peak, you enter a very nice area with lots of birds and critters running around. There is also a very short trail leading to the top of Wilderness Peak (elevation 1,595 feet). However, there is no real view from here. The Cliffs trail technically ends here and the Wilderness Peak Trail starts.""' I must say, we did not see a lot of birds or animals, but this must have been written in the summertime. I must say that the trail was beautiful to me and quite varying in its beauty...many interesting logs...beautiful small waterfalls. The most notable things for me on this trip were: Encountering many trail runners on the trail and MOST MEMORABLE: Seeing a guy who was my size hiking his butt off just like I was. We nodded at each other knowingly and I admired him for working his butt off and in turn, was able to admire myself as well for the attempts I was making. SO GET OUT THERE, OVERWEIGHT COUCH POTATOES, YOU ARE NOT ALONE! It was disappointing in the sense that it had no view for (again, for me) was an exhausting and fatiguing workout. But it did have a nice logbook and some interesting log entries. Also, it was great to read the touching and loving inscription on the bench from someone who had the bench dedicated to them (Darn it, I did not write the name down of who it was dedicated to) due to their love of mountains. I read most of the entries in the logbook, and I must know who ""Shy Bear"" is or what people are referring to. As a writer, legends are quite appealing for the sheer amount of fodder for inspiration or future storytelling, so I would be quite interested in knowing from anyone if they know who ""Shy Bear"" is. As I was contemplating this, I was also discussing various possibilities of the origin of this legend and grilling EastKing about it, since he, after all, is the more experienced hiker. It was quite interesting to read entries like, ""Sorry we missed you Shy Bear. See you next year."" Or ""Shy Bear, I came all the way here to see you and I cannot find you."" So, it was indeed quite intriguing for me. Also, I am very interested and passionate about Native American culture and I could not help but wonder if it was not a Native American legend that had managed to survive and somehow became popularized. Well, the theories do abound, so if anyone could shed some light on this for me, that would be great! As for my log entry, I said I was disappointed with the view, but I was happy that I was finally becoming an official hiker. THE SIMPLE BEAUTY OF COAL CREEK FALLS(11/29/09) I have done Coal Creek Falls once before with EastKing, but doing it in the fall seemed different. The fall leaves by this time were all on the ground, but still, for late November, a fair amount of evidence left that Fall is still with us. I love the fact that as you get closer to the falls you can hear them, and for waterfall enthusiasts and poets like myself, it is like a sweet song of music that I love and it draws me to it. Nothing is more of a healing salve to me than being near water like this. This day was overcast, as were a few other days we have gone out hiking, but we took it in stride. The great part is that although we did not do this in the summer, we did this in the fall and the waterfall was at its height. Coal Creek Falls is a relaxing hike and although it was disappointing that I did not get to do a bigger summit (I had early Chorus rehearsal) it was nice to gain a new respect for the beauty of the falls and to have the chance and opportunity to ruminate on that for a while before I had to rush back. I HIGHLY recommend this trail even for highly advanced hikers, if for nothing else, than to experience the relaxation and beauty of the falls.

single-day,"A Day of Pure Alpine Excellence
Introduction ""While there is a technical side to mountaineering, a confrontation with the raw power of the mountains that came only to be understood by those who venture into the hills, there is an essential element that everyone is familiar with, and that is the friendship you forge along the way. This is such a pivotal part of the experience, that alpinists have given it is own name: The Fellowship of the rope. Because at the end of the day, you may have made the summit, you might have had to turn around, but regardless of the outcome, you have spent an amazing day with a close friend."" - Timb Argast Ever since the first time I have ever stepped foot on Sahale, it has become my favorite mountain. Each time was a new experience for me, almost as if stepping into another world. This time was no exception, it was even better than I had anticipated. Before the trip the mountain had received several inches of snow covering the upper slopes as well as all the other mountains in the entire region. With the weather forecast looking good for summit day, I knew this would be an excellent adventure! The trip started on September 27 when Bryan picked me up from my house for the adventure. Despite the cloudiness and rain in the air, I eagerly waited as we got closer to the mountain. The Cascade Valley was just pouring down rain, fortunately we were in a truck which made sleeping out much friendlier. The next morning we woke up at around 5:30 a.m. to get ready for the climb. Whitehorse covered in Clouds on the way to Sahale Hiking to the Quien Sabe GlacierThe hike up to Boston Basin was pretty easy although according to my North Cascades Hiking Guide Book it is considered ""Very Difficult"". I guess that's what happens when you go climbing mountains several times a week. As morning came on we were hoping to see the sunrise which we happened to be in a thick part of the woods. But at least what was to come later that day made up for it. Waterfalls in the Woods Blue Sky in the Early Morning Looking towards Cascade Valley What Appears to be a Cornice Sunrise on the Glacier A Clearing through the Fog Light Contrast on Hidden Lake Peak Johannesburg Covered in Clouds After getting out of the woods the clouds were clearing off Mount Torment and Forbidden Peak. We had a few more creek crossings before we finally start encountering snow and ice. Keep in mind I was in tennis shoes during this part which made crossing over icy boulders over a creek a bit challenging. A few times I almost fell in. Finally I decided it was not worth dealing with the dozens of frozen creeks through out the boulder field which I stayed by a saddle that went up into Boston Basin. Mount Torment in the Morning Creek before Boston Basin Notch Between Two Mountains Mount Torment Lit Up Ice Crystals on the Plants Waterfalls in Boston Basin Boston Basin and Forbidden Peak Hiking towards Sahale Johannesburg Covered in Fresh Snow Once it became snowier I decided to ditch my tennis shoes and swap to climbing boots. Boston Basin was just covered in fresh slippery ice which made traveling a bit dicey. Fortunately I found what looked like a potential route up that avoided most of the icy boulder but up a steep rock section with a little bit of ice. After crossing a few more ice sections we finally start getting into some real snow making travel much safer and with ease. Sharkfin Tower Forbidden Peak's Summit Upper Reaches of Forbidden Peak Crevasses on the Quien Sabe Snowking Mountain in the Distance Winds on Boston Peak Boston Basin Covered in Ice Beautiful Cascade Peak Mixup Peak Clearing Up Finally we arrive at the Quien Sabe Glacier which meant that it was time to rope up. As we were getting ready the sun started rising over the ridge, but at the same time the winds picked up. The land certainly had a majestic feel to it as I heard the sounds of fine ice crystals blowing in the wind. The mountains now looked very dramatic and gave a certain sense like I was in the Himalaya. Every spare second I couldn't help but glance at all the scenery around. Icy Landscape with Johannesburg Fresh Snow on Cascade Peak Eldorado Peak with Mount Torment Bryan with Johannesburg Heading up Sahale A Fun Alpine ExperiencePutting on the gloves and grabbing my ice axe in my hands I announced ""Time to get my Alpine On!"". We were both excited to now be climbing on the Quien Sabe Glacier. Although with it's beauty we also had to take caution because many of the crevasses around we could see were covered up by fresh powder giving the feeling as though walking through a mine field. But the good news was that this part of the glacier did not seem to have as many crevasses as other parts. Sun Rising Above Sahale Upper Reaches of Sahale Bryan getting Started Sharkfin Tower Jagged Spire on Boston Peak Boston Peak's Summit Block Looking South from Quien Sabe Wind Blown Crevasse We were making great time climbing up the Quien Sabe, but then our paced got slower as the slope got steeper. I was having such a good time that when I finally looked below me I realized that we were on a bit of a steep slope, although manageable as long as you make good steps. Suddenly we reached a part of the climb where a crevasse that was hidden cut all around our surroundings above us. After a little bit of investigating I figured out a round about way going to the left. The rest of the way up the Quien Sabe Glacier was drama free and enjoyable. Looking Down Below Looking up the Quien Sabe Glacier Bergschrund below Boston Peak Mount Baker and Eldorado Peak Forbidden Peak's East Face Rime Ice on Boston's Spire Taking a Rest in Front of Boston Peak Looking Northwest At the very end of the Quien Sabe Glacier there was a bit of a snow covered moat. Bryan was worried about this, so I got ready in ice axe arrest position in case anything went wrong. After crossing over the moat and hiking up a dozen or so feet we were off the West Face and onto the North Ridge. From here I took up the leading position. Mount Goode looking Good Black Peak looking White Mount Logan's West Face The Summit Ridge Having a Great Time Buckner Covered in Snow I figured our chances of summiting was quite high with how good the weather looked and us feeling well. I under estimated the summit block and the fresh snow that created a rime ice on the rocks. The North Ridge was a simple minor snow climb although it had a moment where the powder was loose with exposure, but still manageable. After getting over the first hump of the ridge we were suddenly met with a big cornice. At first it looked very unmanageable and extremely dangerous with thousands of feet of exposure. The idea of attempting it seemed like it would be out right insane. Fortunately I found that I could poke up through the cornice and get over back onto the glacier. Dome, Formidable, and Glacier Peak The Glacier soon ended and we were now about 150 feet from the summit, I could almost taste it. The sheer exposure on both sides of the ridge became evident with each step. On some of the steps I was kicking in it was loose powder with a layer of rime ice underneath making me a little nervous. But I was in full focus and kept my ice axe in as deep as I could to get it between rocks and sticking it into the rime. Then I reached a spot where it seemed impossible to climb any higher safely. The cliffs that many scramble up where covered in ice and loose snow which was certainly a no go. I climbed up a icy section to the left only to encounter a knife edge. Inspired by SP Member IcyPeak I considered riding the ridge. But the main problem was not only was it up sloped, heavily exposed, had rime ice on it, but there was also a hump in the middle of it which made it look so dangerous. Shaking on the ice I take a step onto it and instantly retreat and say ""People were not meant to go on this kind of terrain, especially with no line of protection. My partner's life is in my hands, so for the sake of both of us I will not continue"". My Partner with Boston Peak Sahale's Summit Block Sketchy Terrain Above I carefully down climb the icy terrain back to my partner to make one last attempt for the summit. It looked like there was a possible loop around on the West Face, but also very dangerous. It had just enough foot room for one to carefully scramble on it. My partner took a look and said ""forget it, it's not worth it"". I turned around and nodded in agreement that it was too sketchy. No hard feelings, after all we got the best reward of any mountaineer. A amazing alpine experience where I got to see some of the best scenery in Washington and a great thrilling experience. Plus I already summited this peak the previous year. It's a Long Ways Down Dicey Terrain Looking Over the Cornice West to North Panorama The Route I considered The Cornice Ridge We Crossed Over Going Back DownThe winds were starting to pick up on the Mountain which is why Bryan wanted to get down a ways in speedy fashion. I wanted to stay longer to enjoy the moment, but knew we had to get down before dark. The way back down was decent without any troubles, even the moat jump was not worry some. Later down the mountain there was one issue that we both ran into which our crampons kept balling up making each step a bit more slick. As a result we had to slow down to maintain safety. Looking Down Boston Basin Sahale's West Face Hiking Down Boston Basin Light Clouds over Boston and Sahale Sahale Mountain Covered in Snow Looking Back at our Tracks Boston and Sahale Looming Above Boston Basin Later in the Day At the edge of the Glacier we unroped and were finally able to travel down in a more casual tone. The hot afternoon sun had melted out a significant amount of snow in the region including the Boston Basin. Sahale though was still covered in all sorts of fresh snow because it had not seen much sun due to it's Westward face. The way down was less tedious than on the way up. From here it was a hour walk down to the car. Clouds Above Torment and Forbidden Turn off to Boston Basin The Route to Boston Basin Snow Blowing off of Johannesburg Cascade Peak and Johannesburg Above Crossing a Rock Slab Ash Berries Steep Trail Section Looking Down the Trail Purple Flower Johannesburg with the Sun Setting Sun Shining on the Cascade Valley Waterfalls in Boston Basin Last Light on the Triplets This was another amazing alpine experience which I hope to visit this place again some time in the near future. Certainly a 5 star mountain in my book.

multi-day,"A Great Climb of Goode Mountain
August 10 - 13 The northeast face, September 2011 At 9200 feet, Goode Mountain is the 9th highest peak in Washington state.  There is no easy way to reach the top of this remote mountain.  All routes have hideously long approaches, a matter of several days, and each one involves some degree of technical climbing.  Putting four men at the top would take a group effort, expedition style.  We decided to attempt the SW couloir route which finishes with a few pitches at the top of the northeast buttress. Nearing the north end of Lake Chelan We took the fast ferry to Stehekin Saturday, a town which is not accessible by road.  From there we hiked as far as we could before we were hit by storms.  We had planned to stay in 5-mile-camp which was supposed to be very nice, but we ran out of time for that.  Instead we pitched our tents off-trail down by the river, just before the rain started.  We nicknamed this spot Swamp Camp.  Thunder storms continued throughout the night, but I slept soundly with my earplugs in.  The next morning it was clear again, so Greg and I hiked from the park creek trail up along a climbers boot path to the climbers camp at 7390 feet.  It took us 2 hours and 45 minutes.  We were rushing ahead of Edward and Dave because we wanted to have a shot at climbing Storm King, a neighboring peak.  The boot path up to the climbers camp is hard to find at first but easy to follow most of the way.  Climbers Camp Below Goode Mountain After pitching our tent at 7380 feet we made the traverse on snow and loose rock over to Storm King.  We ascended loose talus/scree and then tricky slabs covered in loose scree.  We reached the base of the nasty loose rotten gully at 8250 feet.  We scrambled up another 15 feet.  Then a crack of thunder boomed.  Greg and I looked at each other.  F**k!  The rain started immediately.  We retreated to the base of the gully over loose wet rock and waited in a semi-sheltered moat to see what would happen next. The Loose Rotten Gully (Storm King summit at left) Greg below the notch Discussing our options, we decided to wait awhile longer and watch the weather.  Our hopes were that it would improve.  The sky didn't look that bad, just some light clouds and one dark one passing overhead toward the east.  After 15 minutes, the storm seemed to have passed and the sky looked promising again.  We started back up the gully until the scrambling became more intimidating.  I then belayed Greg while he place a few pieces and climbed up to the col.  When he got there I heard him say “Oh F**k!”  He later explained that he mantled up and came face to face with the abyss which is the northeast face.  The notch itself was only a foot wide. The Wall of Water At this point I heard more thunder.  I turned around and saw that the sky had darkened.  Then I noticed a wall of falling water coming our way.  It was infuriatingly cliche, but we were getting stormed-off Storm King.  I told Greg that I thought it would be better for him to rap down and clean the route rather than for me to come up to him.  It was time for us to leave and that's what we did.  The sky turned dark (rain drop on lens) We did our best to get back to camp before getting slammed by the storm.  There was heavy rain and then hail.  While crossing a moat at the edge of a snowfield, Greg fell 5 feet when the snow collapsed underneath him, softened by the heavy rain.  He cut his hand very deeply and there was blood everywhere, on the rocks, and all over his shirt.  The gash was half an inched deep and his skin had separated.  There was a lot of soft-tissue exposed.  I bandage him up with a wad of gauge and some duct tape.  I had to use a lot of tape because the rain was so heavy in that moment.  He tied a bandanna over the whole mess and we kept moving. I took this photo before I realized Greg was injured We got back to camp completely drenched and demoralized and spent the rest of the day in our tents hiding from the rain.  Alpenglow on Mount Buckner Gunsight Peak, Sinister Peak, Glacier Peak and Dome Peak The next day we we were up and moving by 6:15am.  Greg said he wasn't even going to think about the pain in his hand during the climb.  I wondered to myself how he was going to deal with it.  One thing was for sure, he would lead none of the pitches. Climbing above the glacier remnant Scrambling up talus on the ridge below the couloir We scrambled up the moraine and crossed the glacier remnant to reach the small rotten ridge below the southwest couloir.  A lot of rocks moved around as we were climbing up to reach the crest of the ridge.  We scrambled up along the crest until we could see the couloir above us.  We found one of two exposed ramps through the cliffs which allow access into the base of the couloir.  The couloir was broad and the scrambling easy.  Along the left side we found the mythical “black stairs”, a vein of darker solid rock with step formations which make for easy scrambling. Entering the southwest couloir Climbing the ""black stairs"" We continued to follow the black staircase to within 50 vertical feet of the apparent chimney at climbers left.  Here we roped up and Dave led a horizontal slab pitch to reach a hidden gully on the right side of the couloir.  Half way across the ledge he kicked loose a rock which went flying down the couloir (see the video). The slab ledge traverse Looking back down the couloir From the top of the hidden gully, we scrambled a few more feet up to ""black tooth notch"".  Whoa!  Suddenly we were high on the northeast face of Goode, with thousands of feet of exposure below us.  We followed a broad sandy ledge north for 30 feet and then rappelled down 20 feet to another ledge.  We followed the second ledge north and then scramble-traversed on 4th class rock over to the famed northeast buttress. The class 4 traverse On the northeast buttress On the buttress we roped up again and Edward led a long pitch up to a higher notch at the very top of the buttress.  We secured both ends of the rope so that Dave and I could climb simultaneously using prusiks.  That was our strategy for saving time.  Ideally, rock climbing is done in pairs but since there were four of us we had to do it differently.  The rock itself was easy, low to mid fifth class, but there were a lot of small blocks balanced precariously and it took care not to send these down on each other.  After Dave and I reached Edward, Greg followed at the end of the rope with a belay.  One thing was on all of our minds.  Was this good weather going to hold for us?  That was the big question.  After the major storm of the previous day, we were all a little jumpy. Above the glaciers on the northeast buttress The summit seen from the wrong notch Something didn't seem right.  The little notch we had climbed into was terribly exposed and what stood in front of us looked harder than it should be.  Apparently we were slightly off route.  Edward set a sling around what looked like a horn and Dave belayed Greg and Edward as they climbed down to a ledge about 20 feet below.  He then prepared to rappel down to the ledge.  I told him to wait a second because I didn't trust the look of the horn the sling was around.  I looked behind it and squatted down to see it from below.  Then I pushed on it and the whole thing moved.  Dave and I exchanged a knowing look.  I might have just saved his life.  Always check your horns!  I made a mental note to talk to Edward about it after the climb. Enjoyable climbing With Exposure Edward led the last long pitch straight up to the summit.  Now above the buttress, we climbed up more of a flat face.  There were a lot of features and it was nice enjoyable climbing with mad exposure!  Dave and I did used prusiks again and Greg followed with a belay at the end of the rope.  I was happy to see the bivy spots on the summit, which I had previously heard about.  There was a register from 2011 left by Franklin B and Andy D.  This was certainly one of the best views in Washington!  I could even see Johannesburg. The last 30 feet On the summit of Goode Mountain We reversed the route using both our 60 meters ropes for longer rappels.  After the first rap, the rope got stuck.  It would not budge.  I tied one end of it to my harness to act as a counter-weight while Greg prusiked up the other side to fix the problem. Mount Logan seen from the summit Forbidden Peak, Eldorado Peak, and Mount Baker seen from the summit There was one sketchy class 4 traverse near the top of Black Tooth Notch.  A sling had been left there as a psychological belay.  I added another sling to it ant then checked to make sure that the knots in the original sling were snug and trustworthy.  To my dismay I found that one of the tails of the knot in the original sling had slipped back inside the knot.  Tails on this type of know should be at least two inches long.  I took the time to take it apart and re-tie it, all the while holding onto the class 4 rock in such a precarious spot.  Honestly, this whole episode scared the crap out of me.  The first rappel Greg took this shot of me on the second rappel We spent a second night at high camp and hiked out the following day.  Back near Coon Lake, we encountered thousands of tiny toads on the ground.  It was difficult to avoid stepping on them but I did my best. Back at camp Tuesday evening we stayed with our friends Trapper and Roxanne at their cabin in Stehekin.  They cooked us pizza from scratch and offered us clean beds and showers.  What a treat!  I could tell they were living vicariously through our photos and stories of the climb.

multi-day,"Mt. Rainier, despite it all....
I can’t believe I made it! One day of training (being hurled down a slope hoping to god I paid attention when they were giving the self arrest instructions) and 3 days on the mountain. We encountered 90 degree heat while hoofing it up to base camp with our 50 pound packs, followed by freezing temperatures and then a huge thunder storm, with lightning of course….step away from the gear honey! Spent the first night with my 2 partners stuffed into supposedly a 3-man tent (would have liked to have seen an actual demo of that) with the howling winds causing the tent sides to slap me across the face all night. Night one, no sleep. The morning brought a big snowstorm, followed by hail and finally just a simple old-fashioned downpour. Spent the day acclimatizing, eating gummy bears and trying to avoid lightning. For the second night, I moved into the hut, rubbing my lucky rabbit’s foot that there was one spot left for me. Me, 11 others and a herd of furry little grey critters with twitching noses, enough said. Night two, no sleep. Add to that the horror of dehydrated food and half frozen pop tarts, the lost toe nail, the blue bags, the sitting on my camelback spout and getting my butt soaked at 2 am on summit day. Hmmm, think that's it...oh except for the fact that I had to pp in front of the entire all-guys team (headlamps down!..and I mean it!) ...ok, think that about covers it. Oh, almost forgot. Add to it the near death experience of one of my tent-mates when he sheepishly informed me that he “may have accidentally” eaten my last peanut butter and jelly sandwich. We were all given two (2) sandwiches…when you were eating the third (3rd)...didn’t you do the math! I’m still mad about that, haven’t been able to let that one go yet. This sandwich tragedy set-off drooling fantasies about scarfing down the all-day omelette special followed by dessert in a bowl, at Denny’s. Oh gawd. So anyway, in summary, it was a fantastic trip!! Would do it all over again in a heartbeat, minus the sandwich incident obviously. The summit was spectacular and this is what life is all about. Now, back to work where everything seems so boring in comparison, although, having water magically come out of a tap instead of hauling it on my back, not eating my dinner out of a bag and having a toilet to sit on are not to be underestimated.

single-day,"""This area makes me nervous""
Bob at the highpoint 7 years ago? Time is flying my friends, really flying. While looking through my pictures the other night, I came across the album of pics that brought back vivid memories of one of the highlight hikes of 2003. While not much has changed on Mt. Adams, a lot has changed for me. Of course I am now 7 years older (and hopefully wiser) but I have since retired from a dental practice in Kennewick Washington and moved across several states to the state of Utah where I am now involved in the education of dental hygiene students, a wonderful way to share my knowledge and experience with up and coming professionals. I am also living in a state that is loaded with mountains and things to do. As I approach my 70th year, I still feel young and vibrant and much of this I owe to my friends who I have developed over the past 7 years. Lucky is the man who has friends like Bob, Dennis, Rick, Bill, Kadee, Greg, Mike, Eric and the list could go on and on. No need to put last names here, you know who you are. Many many thanks. I dedicate this trip report to the guy who started it all, SP member Bob Bolton. To you Bob, I offer my finest salute and thanks. And of course, a special thanks and salute to my wife, without whose understanding and support of my mountain passion, none of this could have happened. One more note: This hike was toward the end of my first major season of hiking and climbing and had many many special events and climbs but this one is worth highlighting because the pictures do it so well for me. A long day on shaky rocks Bob Bolton: ""We got the asterisks off our lists by becoming the last known county highpointers to visit the new Skamania County highpoint who had previously climbed pre-eruption Mt. St. Helens. To all of you who compared the Skamania situation to the change in the Michigan state highpoint, fahhgetaboutit - there is no comparison! We did a very reasonable route for a one-day attempt, and even then it was at least 17 miles RT, with nearly half of that being off trail, with much of that on mobile boulders and/or Mt. St. Helens ash scree. Second, this route had a total elevation gain of just over 5,000 feet. There were three other routes with very similar total elevation gain (including the one from Cold Springs - by the time you consider the ups and downs on the Round the Mountain Trail, it would have been very close to 5,000 feet but with considerably more mileage). To put it mildly, this is a major effort no matter how you slice it."" Bob described it well in a report written for the cohp.org website. I for one will never forget this hike as it had a little of everything but best of all it had the companionship of a good friend, Bob Bolton. He was the one who introduced me to county highpointing and a bit later on, to prominence peaks, so it was one of many adventures we shared together. I had just done several other county high points (Clark) with Bill Jacobs and another by myself but this one was the highlight of a great weekend in southwest washington. After finishing Pacific county, I made my way to Vancouver and Bob joined me for this one and we drove our vehicles to the trailhead to spend the evening and get an early start from. When we got to the Stagman Ridge trailhead on Saturday evening, the only other vehicle in the parking lot was one from Wisconsin. We immediately thought ""county highpointer"" - who else from Wisconsin would be at this trailhead? We had hoped to encounter the owner of the vehicle, but alas it's a big place up there, and where there are no trails, it would be very easy to miss each other. By the time we got back to the trailhead, the car was gone. We slept in our vehicles on Saturday night, and got up in time to start hiking at just after 7 AM. The first trail junction was at about 3 miles. We turned left toward the Pacific Crest Trail. The trail climbs sometimes rather steeply to its junction with the PCT. When we reached the PCT, we turned right onto the PCT, and in about 0.4 mile is the junction to the Round the Mountain Trail. Walk a few steps on this trail and turn left, cross country, into Horseshoe Meadow. At this point you can pretty much pick and choose your route. With Bob using a map of the area, he determined the best way to go and I was happy to follow. So we climbed the little ridge to the north of the meadows, then to the east of ""The Bumper"", then on toward the north-northeast, heading toward the west ridge of Mt. Adams. Snow is a big help in avoiding the scree and moveable talus, however this late in the season there was too little snow, and it was rather hard. My boots didn't have a sharp enough edge or tread to provide adequate traction where the snow was somewhat steep and so I made a note to myself, wear different boots next time. The talus moved all over the place and was a major hindrance on this climb. Several times upon stepping on a seemingly stable rock, the boulders on the hillside above stated sliding down toward us, a very disconcerting sensation to say the least. Visions of starting a landslide and having the rocks bury us were best kept from our minds but I remembered a guy on a mountain in utah that was buried by this same type of junk. He had climbed that mountain at least ten times before but maybe the 11th time was not a lucky number for him. Thanks to GPS technology and spending time with the map, we pretty well covered all of the area that would've been a candidate for the highest point (or highest rock). Again, it was unnerving to have the rocks move under you in such a way as you just felt the whole slope was unstable. It turned out that a couple years later, Paul Klenke was in this area and his pictures seem to indicate that the rocks had indeed shifted or slid. Ugh. Others have mentioned that this area would be best done when there is snow cementing the rocks together and I am one who really wholeheartily agrees. Bob made this note in that cohp.org trip report: ""While we were at and just below the HP, we were able to see the upper reaches of the Pinnacle Glacier just northeast of us. The glacier is covered by rocks and dirt all the way from the top to the base of the steep part of the mountain. There is a constant roar over on that glacier. It is reminiscent of the wonderful sound in the North Cascades of water tumbling from high snow and ice fields down the steep hillsides to the roaring stream at the bottom. But this wasn't water, it was constantly falling rock, and lots of it. I suspect that as the sun came around to the west far enough to warm the ice, the junk that had been held in place by that ice would give way as the edge of the ice became too weak to hold it. I'm sure there are other explanations. We couldn't even see it - we could only hear it. Not sure if it was simply out of sight, or if it was too far away to see it with the naked eye. Incredible! That is a VERY unstable mountain, as are all of the Cascade volcanoes."" We had great views of Mt. Rainier, Mt. Hood and Mt. St. Helens from our rocky viewpoint but I will add that you definitely earn it. Once again I will mention that Bob and I covered the whole area of the 8920 contour and also allowed for above and below elevation correction. We did not ever want to come back (although Bob has since re-visited the highpoint liner area from a different trailhead) Bob summed it up well by stating: ""In short, this cohp is a bear. Most folks would probably choose to backpack this one, but we didn't see any water up there. Earlier in the season with snow melting and snow to walk on, this might actually be a rather enjoyable backpack. But you probably won't be able to avoid at least some of the talus and scree, so it would still have its down side. If you're not planning to complete Washington due to other challenges like Rainier or Bonanza or Olympus or Adams or several others, I would suggest avoiding this one. I would especially warn against soloing this highpoint as it would be very easy to injure yourself on this unstable mountain, and there are very few visitors to the west side of Mt. Adams above the trails. "" Our return to our vehicles went relatively fast although we ran into the remains of an old aircraft that had crashed. Bob reported the wreck site to the sheriffs department after we left the area and we found out later on that the wreck had been logged and recorded by the FAA. When we were just about back to the trailhead, it was dark (shorter days in September) and we were spooked by some large crashing noise that came from nearby. Most likely an elk that was spooked by us. The drive home was spent dodging elk and deer on the highway that leads back to the Columbia Gorge. Overall: 17 miles, 5000' elevation gain, 12 hours of hiking. (not including the hour we spent for lunch and searching the liner area). I could sum up the liner area for this county very succinctly: ""This area makes me nervous"" Images View ""This area makes me nervous"" Image Gallery - 25 Images Comments Post a Comment Viewing: 1-8 of 8 lcarreau - Aug 8, 2010 9:31 am - Voted 10/10 About the mountain: I was always intrigued by the west side of Adams.

multi-day,"Going for the Gusto: A Two Day Climb on the Torment Forbidden Traverse
Introduction Boston Basin Trailhead View""I have learned, that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours."" - Henry David Thoreau The Torment Forbidden Traverse is the most extensive rock climbing route I've done to date. While not very technically inclined, it consists of a large quantity of class 4 and low 5th climbing and of course some mid 5th moves. It is said that every mountaineering skill you've learned will be used on this route. Both Mark and I agreed with this statement. From traversing talus, steep trails, glacier travel, rock climbing, loose rock scrambles, steep ledge traversing, down climbing, snow climbing, rappels, wet slabs, snow climbing, getting lost, and a big creek crossing. This route pushed us pretty hard, but we had an awesome time. Plus it was sweet to redo the West Ridge of Forbidden Peak which is listed on the 50 classics of North America. By the end of the trip we arrived exhausted at the car by 2:30 a.m. Day 1: Climbing Mount TormentIt had been several months since I've seen my buddy Mark Straub who is currently living in New York. Due to his work schedule and having to pack we left my house around 12:30 a.m. On the way to the Boston Basin trailhead we both saw a guy walking in the middle of the road with fog all around. I can't fully explain it, but this guy looked almost like a ghost. I relax thinking that it was me just being sleepy. A few seconds later Mark says ""did you see that!?"". I guess you can see new things even after driving through this area a million times. Lets just say it was a weird sight. Any who, we arrived at the trailhead around 3:30 a.m. We decided to sleep in a little due to how late we arrived. Johannesburg with the Moon Climbers Topping out near the CJ Col Cascade Peak North Face Johannesburg Northeast Buttress At about 7:20 a.m. we woke up and got ready for the big day ahead of ourselves. After taking a few more pictures we were on our way up to Boston Basin. I once read in a hiking book that it was rated ""extreme"", I joked about it as we hiked up the trail. We arrived at Boston Basin at 10 a.m. where we snapped a lot of photos of the flowers and surrounding landscape. Mark and I stashed our approach shoes under a rock, I swapped into plastic boots. Johannesburg with Flowers Wildlife of Boston Basin Flowers with Sahale and Boston Edge of Mount Formidable The Trail Up Boston Basin Waterfall Slabs of Forbidden Peak Forbidden Peak from Boston Basin Mount Torment's Southeast Face Sharkfin Tower Mixup Peak's North Face Cascade Valley looking West The traverse over to Torment Basin was straight forward. On one of the talus fields a boulder slipt from underneath me. My leg fell into a slot and so did the boulder. I immediately panicked because I wasn't sure what I did to my leg. After pulling it out of the hole I was relieved that I didn't break it but did have to wait 10 minutes before evaluating it's condition. Felt like such a silly place to get an injury, but at least it would be better here than on the traverse. Eventually I was able to walk on it again and announced that we could proceed. I do admit that it did hurt even a week later on my Johannesburg trip. If another boulder issue like this happened again, I would have had to call it quits. Mark Approaching Torment Basin Looking up Mount Torment's Headwall With a little bit of traversing and scrambling we arrived in Torment Basin at about 12:15 p.m. At the glacier we roped up and proceeded to the hidden gully up to the south ridge of Mount Torment. With limited sleep and feeling hungry I was already feeling fatigued. Before arriving at the bergschrund we took a lunch break and let the party in front of us finish up the loose class 3/4 gully. After lunch we crossed the bergschrund and arrived at the hidden gully. Swapping into rock shoes was a little tricky with a heavy pack and all, but was manageable by putting my pack down into the moat. Then I had to carefully cross by Mark to start the belay. I stayed to the left to avoid rocks that were coming down the gully. Mark arrives at the belay station and belays me up. As the rope gets pulled in I saw a big knot in the rope which took some untangling. I carefully scramble up the class 3/4 gully. Mark with Sahale and Boston Peak Entering the Gully to the South Ridge At the top there was a low 5th class pitch to the belay station. From here Mark sets me on belay and now I'm on lead. We avoided the headwall in the ridge and went left of it. Staying on the south ridge but lightly west. After a few more pitches we arrive to a friendly saddle on the south ridge below the summit. Terrible Tangle Climbing on the South Ridge There is a perfect spot for putting two big packs on. Of course we used it. Being packless made the last part up Torment a lot easier and safer. From here we traversed upwards (right) along some ledges working around the summit. We went from the south ridge to it's southeast side and then finished on the north east side. The true summit is the one on the left (south summit). It felt good to have a light breeze and a late afternoon sun. After making a careful photo exchange by traversing folks back and forth we started the descent.

Mark rappelled first and hopped over the moat. When I rappelled down, I span around a bit due to it being a huge over hang. ""So this is what it's like to be in space"" I joked aloud as I tried not to get out of control. ""Mark, how did you deal with this bergschrund"" I yelled. ""Go to the bottom and just make a jump for it"" Mark replied. He was right, it was a simple swing out jump with having to catch the snow. It was fun to watch one of the other guys swing too far and have to swing back. ""No going back"" I whispered to myself as I looked up the formidable over hanging wall we just rappelled off of. Rappelling onto the Glacier The Beginning of the Traverse My Turn to Rappel Down (Mark) Looking down onto the Taboo Glacier (Mark) After putting things away we traversed around a crevasse and started traversing towards Forbidden Peak. While we traveled along side of a moat there was a crevasse on the other side of it. Mark decided to have us rope up which a belay was set up. Mark took the lead, once the rope ran out we simul climbed. As Mark was traversing on the rocks while I was still on the snow the rope got caught pretty hard on the rocks. I had to down climb into steep slushy snow to get it untangled. I then had to scramble up some dangerous talus to get back up on route. Mark wondered what was going on, ""I had no choice"" I announced as we arrive at a decent bivy spot. The sun was setting and we knew that we might be in trouble if we continued on. So we settled for a flattish rock spot on the traverse. It took a long time to melt snow even with keeping water in the container to speed up the process. After a good round of top romen we got ready for bed. Mark decided to sleep at a separate bivy site to prevent himself from rolling off a cliff in the middle of the night. On my end I faced the slope and had to make a rock pillow. City folks would call it terrible, but it was the best one would find in the area. While looking up at the stars I saw the flicker of thunder in the distance. I would wake up in the middle of the night due to large rock gaps and edges in my back. Evening View of the Inspiration Glacier (Mark) Day 2: Torment Forbidden TraverseIn the morning I made a bowl of cereal using powdered milk. After breakfast we packed our gear and started up the traverse again. After passing around the corner Mark took the lead and we went up some easy 5th class. Morning Ray on Jack Mountain The Edge of Mount Torment My Bivy Spot Mark's Bivy Spot (Mark) Morning View of Eldorado Peak (Mark) View from our Bivy (Mark) At one point I came across a huge loose boulder in the route which left me no choice but to throw it down the mountain below me. As I bumped it down I had to be very careful not to knock it onto myself. Once it started coming down I had to give it a good shove and have it lightly fly over me. The usual explosion of rocks came with it's crashing way down below into the glacier. The next section was a little tricky, while technically we did it unroped, it required much more caution. As we crossed a narrow ledge with heavy packs, I looked down. Normally I'm not afraid of heights but the fact that the pack would catch on the wall made it a bit more dangerous. The next section was a down sloping slab with poor hand holds but was fortunately manageable at a slow speed. Looking Down onto the Forbidden Glacier from the Second Bivy Spot (Mark) Forbidden Peak looking Intimidating (Mark) We arrived at the next bivy spot. Someone pooped right in the middle of the route which both Mark and I stepped in. We both had to clean our rock shoes and my hand. Errrrrrrrr. After what felt like 10 minutes of scrubbing we proceeded to the snow crossing. It looked a bit steep but fortunately there were bucket steps in it to make it more comfortable. We placed our axes in deep where we could and had quality crampons steps. I managed to enjoy it a bit. Looking back at the Steep Snow Traverse (Mark) At the next section Mark led and we traversed down onto the snow. Then we climbed up the snow slope to a nice break spot in the ridge. After resting we traversed onto the south side with a nice class 3 ledge. On the other side we walked along the ridge until it became knifey. Mark proceeded to lead this pitch. At the last part of the traverse I led which was mostly easy going. Rock Edge we Went Around TFT High Point Mark scrambling on the Traverse Approaching Forbidden Peak Yours Truly with Forbidden Peak (Mark) The crux of the entire traverse may have been pulling the rope due to the intense rope drag. On the patio I was pulling until my arms were too tired to pull. Once the rope was pulled in we began our rappel down towards the bottom of the West Ridge of Forbidden Peak. Using the south side ledge we followed it upwards until we arrived at the West ridge. The Patio Looking South at the Ptarmigan Traverse Shadows on Sahale and Boston Cascade Peak and Johannesburg Cosho, Kimtah, Katsuk, and Mesahchie Mesahchie under Gloomy Weather Looking Down the Ridge West Ridge of Forbidden Peak Rappelling Down to the West Ridge It was about 5:00 p.m. and the weather was looking questionable. ""Should we proceed"" Mark asked. I already climbed this route but knew how much it would mean to Mark if we gave it a go. I was pretty sure the weather wouldn't get too terrible. We free soloed the first part of the ridge to save time. Arriving at the air step I forgot how far down it was which one has to build up a little bit of confidence before making the step/jump. ""We are flying up"" I announced. Finally we had to rope up due to a down climb section that would have scared me a little bit unroped. The next two pitches Mark led to speed up the climb. As we get closer to the summit the clouds move in and were already hitting the summit. With a few more moves we arrived on the summit with only a moment to spare. After having a hasty snack we start the rush down the mountain. Gloomy Weather over Cosho Peak and Kimtah Peak Hustling DownThe clouds where blowing in which blocked the views to the south. ""Where are the rap rings?"" I yell in a little bit of anger. Someone took most of them off the mountain! The previous year the raps down where amazing, but this year we ended up having to do a lot of down climbing 4th and low 5th class. Eventually we managed to get back onto the West ridge by traversing a edge of the face. Lucky for us a few rap rings were still there which we were able to do two rappels. We met up with the other group we saw on the Torment Forbidden Traverse which we shared a rope for rapping down. Mark on Rappel Forbidden's Summit (Mark) Racing Down the West Ridge Rappelling Off Forbidden Peak Mount Torment through the Clouds After the last rap we hustled the rest of the way down the west ridge. The air jump was scarier looking than I remember it being. ""How am I going to get across this thing"" I semi joked to myself. After holding my breath I made the step/jump move. After a few more minutes we arrived at the gear stash and put things away. It was getting dark and we had to make as good of time as possible. As I walked down the gully I was reminded of how loose the rock was. When Mark arrived we down climbed to the first rappel station. Just above the rap station I was a bit freaked out because I had to down climb 4th class with a heavy pack while exhausted in plastic boots and high exposure. Mark gave me a ""fall belay"" here which helped me feel calmer for this. Chances of falling where actually quite high considering that I couldn't make very good foot holds. I was relieved as I arrived at the rappel station. I let Mark go down first. As he went down the sun was setting which I took a few pictures due to having a short amount of free time. Eldorado Peak with a Cloudy Atmosphere Down Climbing on the Northwest Face Boston Peak with Evening Light Sahale with a Stormy Atmosphere Johannesburg during Evening Sunset Colors on Sharkfin Tower Sahale and Boston Peak with Evening Light Looking towards Bonanza Peak Red Mountain during Sunset Sunsight Peak during Evening Views to the South Clouding Over From here it was a series of rappels down while trying not to knock down rocks onto each other including the other group. As we went down I became nervous as the atmosphere around us became dark blue. Had to make good time, hold fast, and be very careful. By the end of the last rappel it was night time. We pulled out our head lamps, ice axes, and crampons to down climb the gully. Oh the joys of down climbing snow in the dark. Cascade Peak and Johannesburg getting Covered by Clouds Getting Lost on Waterfall SlabsEarlier in the day I looked down the glacier to make sure we passed through the proper spot. After jumping over a moat we hiked the rest of the way down the glacier. The other team of climbers was ahead going off to the left. It was obvious they hit the big crevasse and could not proceed. We walked over a few small ones but had smooth sailing for the rest of the glacier travel. I thought for sure we were all good to go for getting off the mountain. Once we got off the glacier it was time to navigate the waterfall slabs. There were cliffs underneath of us. I managed to get us a few hundred feet further down by traversing a sketchy edge with water flowing on us with slippery moss. Then we went to the left where we found ice chunks that fell off the glacier with more cliffs below. We went to the middle area where it was a complete headwall. I looked at my camera and found exactly where we were or at least where I believed we were. Unfortunately because of the perspective things were a little different from what they seemed. After heading way to the right the snow ended and we ended up at the edge of another major head wall. Mark proposed going down a steep wet mossy slope with cliffs below. ""Mark, I really don't feel comfortable with this"" I anncounced to Mark. It would have been quite dangerous to go down at the very least. After an hour or so of wondering around in the dark Mark had us go through the left side to see how it would work out. Mark did quite well navigating down the slabs and eventually in to safety. I was so happy to be in Boston Basin. Looking up above I could see way up on the mountain where the other party was lost on the waterfall slabs. Enduring an Exhausting Hike OutWe had our gear stashed under a rock. Fortunately I took a picture of it which I used to give us enough evidence to remember the area of which it was at. After 10 minutes or so of looking around we found them, put them on and continued the hustle down. I was quite pleased when I found the trail. A moment later we crossed a big snow patch and the trail was gone. ""Where is it"" I announced as I looked around for it. I decided to go downwards to meet up with the trail. Eventually we found one which ended up being a fake. The slope ahead looked totally wrong which meant we had to go back up. After doing a diagonal traverse we arrived on what appeared to be the main trail. After walking on it for 10 minutes I realized that it appeared to not be the trail we came up on. It was not as well maintained and had a lot of rocks on it making us slip a bit. After a while I starting thinking ""please let this take us the right way, please let this be the right way"". If it was another fake I knew that we would be stuffed and wouldn't have the energy to make it back down. To our excitement it eventually met up with the main trail. A moment later we arrive at the creek crossing. The creek was raging, I had a hard time believing how much bigger it got. I was so exhausted that when I leaned over with my pack on, I tipped over and did a cheap catch. After a moment of struggling I was able to get back up from being on my face. We did a evaluation of the creek and could not find an easy crossing spot. So we decided to take off our shoes and cross bare foot. I had to use huge boulders to prevent myself from tipping over. The cold water was numbing cold, but we made it through in good time. After crossing the creek we put our shoes and socks back on and carried on down the trail. For a while the traveling was decent until we got to the steep section of the trail. Falling down the trail was a serious possibility. There were some trip spots and lots of dirt being kicked around. We both took back our opinions of the trail not being extreme. It certainly is rated extreme when your tired, going down in the dark, and have a heavy packs on. After a long time of walking down in the dark and a few rests we arrived at the car. It was 2:30 a.m. which we were so excited. ""What an epic trip"" I announced. I was satisfied for a week - until our next big epic Johannesburg. Special thanks to Steph Abegg for her great trip report which gave us some important clues on where to go and confidence of not getting lost. I admit at first glance the instructions left me very intimidated which is why I waited an extra year. But for a good reason.

Your photos get better and better. Imagine how beautiful the views would be if you do this traverse in winter?! Has it seen many winter ascents? Josh Lewis - Nov 14, 2013 8:07 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Great report! Thanks Vitaliy. Keep in mind that some of these photos were taken by Mark Straub. The photos that he took have a (Mark) at the end. But I am trying to improve my photography technique and be very selective about my photos while still attempting to keep up with the quantity I used to use. I wanted to take more on the route itself, but we had to make good time and some spots were difficult to take them at. We both were using SLR sized cameras for all these pictures. A point and shoot would have made it a lot easier. From what I've heard this route has not been done in winter. It would be a huge under taking at the least from what I understand. John Scurlock has taken a lot of nice winter shots of the Traverse during Winter. The West Ridge (top of the photo) has quite a few flutings during winter. It would be stunning at the very least. To see it up close myself in winter would be fantastic. MoapaPk - Nov 13, 2013 5:16 pm - Voted 10/10 Nice Pretty amazing for a kid with Asperger's! ;^) Check grammar though -- ""since I seen""! Josh Lewis - Nov 14, 2013 8:15 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Nice Thanks MoapaPK. All these years I refused to believe that I should give up going for my dreams of being a mountaineer just because of some conditions that I have. Yeah it had some rough edges and hard times, but I believe you don't have to be ""born to be a mountaineer"". Some are made. ;-) I am thankful I had a little help along the way too. I changed ""since I seen"" to ""since I've seen"". Mike Lewis - Nov 13, 2013 11:15 pm - Voted 9/10 Satisfied for a week? Hell! I'd be satisfied for a lifetime! I struggle to comprehend that you do this regularly. Josh Lewis - Nov 14, 2013 8:20 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Satisfied for a week? When given the opportunity for another great climb, I was satisfied until the next climb. So this could mean that the satisfaction could have lasted longer than a week. But Jburg satisfied for a long time! What a beast that thing is. nickmech - Nov 14, 2013 1:13 am - Hasn't voted epic? Nice job. Why do you call all your climbs epic? Josh Lewis - Nov 14, 2013 7:54 pm - Hasn't voted Re: epic? In the heat of the moment when getting off of a mountain one says things that might be a little more intense than they actually were. At the end of the report I was quoting myself. It may not have been classified as an ""epic"" but it was certainly a toughy. Johannesburg however was actually an epic. According to Wikipedia an epic is ""In climbing, an ordinary climb rendered difficult by adverse factors"". That was certainly the case with Jburg.

Josh Lewis - Nov 14, 2013 10:28 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Amazing pictures Thanks Snidely. Climbs like these have recently convinced me that I need to create a online magazine dedicated to awesome ascents. Not just rock climbers, or ice, but various alpine achievements including first ascents. Years ago when I was a kid, I was flipping through a national geographic book and saw a climber on the hanging glacier of Johannesburg. I thought to myself ""that looks pretty rad"". Now that I'm older I hope to bring on the table some of the things that I've seen. There were awesome scenes on the traverse that were for our eyes only. mfox79 - Nov 15, 2013 8:27 pm - Hasn't voted Thanks! That looked like one hell of a journey.

multi-day,"Having the Time of my Life: A 9 Day Extravaganza through the North Cascades
Introduction ""Getting up is optional, getting down is mandatory"" -Ed Viesters ""I'll interpret the rocks, learn the language of flood, storm and the avalanche. I'll acquaint myself with the glaciers and wild gardens, and get as near the heart of the world as I can."" -John Muir ""This is just what I needed!"" -Sebastian Rosa ""Two Thumbs Way Up! I can never live the adventure of a life time just once!"" -Personal Statement This was an extraordinary adventure, perhaps one of the greatest weeks of my life. Although I had many summit attempts, I certainly was living out the true spirit of mountaineering. Mountaineering to me is about adventure, companionship, and having the time of your life. Every new person I met during this extravaganza was from SummitPost, which I'm always impressed at how the internet has made finding partners much easier than it used to be. Day 1: Checking out Crater Mountain Crater Mountain from the Highway We originally made plans to climb Mount Hardy, but the South Face appeared to have some bush whacking involved which my partners were not to keen about. So instead as an alternative plan we went back West for Crater Mountain. The trail started out nice and easy, although it felt a bit like a jungle from the humid forest environment. After a few miles of hiking we came across a creek crossing which had a bit of a waterfall to the side of it. Joanna did not feel comfortable taking Holly across the creek, so we came up with an alternative plan which was to bush whack up the slope and find a safer crossing. Michael Crossing the Creek After going up about 500 feet we still did not find any decent crossings, so we decided to go up to the water source and cross there. I decided it would be best to follow a small creek up, which to my luck it surprisingly brought us to a lesser brushy area. Traversing the Side of Crater Mountain From here we traversed around to the right of the mountain. I had only briefly looked at a map of the mountain, which I suppose my navigation skills have gotten better at finding the way up. At the top we could see Jack Mountain, as well as many other North Cascade Peaks. Eldorado and Tricounti Peak Yours Truly with Jack Mountain We wondered whether we should find the trail or take the way we originally came. Considering we would run into the same problem as when we came in we came back the same way we came in. At the trailhead we decided it would be a good place to camp at and enjoy the stars while I cooked hot chocolate for my brother Michael. Day 2: Driveway ButteIn the early morning we could hear it raining outside which we all decided to sleep in late considering that we would not want to climb anything big if the weather was bad. Fortunately weather forecasts for the eastern Cascades were looking decent, so we went over Washington Pass for Driveway Butte. The weather here was perfect, light passing clouds casting cool shadows over the mountains. The beginning of Driveway Butte has all sorts of wild flowers covering the mountain side. To the South we could see the Gardeners as well as Silver Star Peak as well as a few others. Joanna and Holly in a Field of Flowers Driveway Butte Panorama Looking West A ways up we traveled through a burnt forest which in this area of the mountain there were no more flowers. Unlike most adventures, our turn around time was based on when the store in Mazama closed which was 7 p.m. The walk to the summit of Driveway Butte was relaxing, although with good views. We went down the mountain in decent time, while making it to Mazama just before the store closed. From here we went back West for Stetattle Ridge the next day. Sunset over the Ridge Day 3: Heading Back to Stetattle RidgeWe woke up early this time for Stetattle Ridge which has at least 6,000 feet of elevation gain which meant we were in for a full days work. The trail this time was much friendlier, hardly any fallen over trees and a few flowers on the way. A Tiger Lily on the Trail As we curved on the mountain we had to cut off the trail and onto the ridge. Unlike the past two times I been here it was now summer which we had to bush whacking through, I now understand why most do this one during winter time. Heading off Trail After going through a bit of bush wracking the ridge opened up and we came onto familiar grounds. Joanna did not like what she saw at the crux because it was melted out and was a class 3 rock scramble, fortunately we managed a way around it to the left in the woods to get around it and back onto the ridge. From here we walked out for a ways on the ridge to get some of the best views of the area. The Crux We avoided Cornice Break Off It's as Steep as it Looks Michael Getting His Alpine On Michael with Rainbow Clouds At around 4 p.m. we finally decided it was best to start heading back. After getting off of the upper ridge we got a bit lost on the way down, which we had to carefully descend in the woods. ""I'll bet we'll get out of this mess in a few minutes"" I announced excitedly because I heard water noises below. ""Alright, if we get out of this within the next couple of minutes I'll buy you guys ice cream!"" I heard. Sure enough we found the trail, and they kept there word. This was a very good deal I thought as I enjoyed the fireworks on the car ride home. Ptarmigan Off Trail Day 4: Heading up to South TwinOn the Night of July 4th I knew that if I wanted this line of adventure to continue on, I had to contact Eric as soon as possible. I gave him a call, he said him and Sebastian were climbing South Twin and Mount Shuksan. Immediately I was on the trip as well, which even though it was the night of forth July which most people around were lighting off fire works, I had a trip to prepare for. After packing up my gear I managed to get a few hours of sleep, which Eric picked me up in the morning to meet up with Sebastian (aka Sebas). I found Sebas to be an interesting character, when looking at our route on a map he would grab a piece of grass to use as a pointer and say ""See zis Ridge, we will be taking zis guy here"". Both Eric and Sebas were easy going, and were great company. After figuring out all the plans we left Bellingham and on to South Twin. We decided to go for the East Side of South Twin up to Wiseman Lake for our route. Twin Sisters on the Way ""I can see why they call you Sebas!"" Eric announced while the car went over a bump while driving swiftly down the road to South Sister. ""This is nothing compared to the old me a few years back"" Sebas replied. The drive it self was a bit exciting on its own with all the bumps and curves in the road. When we got to the trailhead Sebas said ""Alright, I'll drive a bit more gentile on the ride back"". But I gotta admit it was kinda fun. Although I love my boots, they unfortunately give me blisters. I know it's not my feet because with other boots on long over night trips I don't get blisters on my heels like I do with these ones, so I finally decided to bring approach shoes. This turned out to be a great idea. Starting out the hike we immediately came to the river crossing which the bridge was washed out. Fortunately there was two very nicely placed logs to cross on, which made things a lot easier. Crossing the River The trail up the forest was in relatively in good shape, although with a tree slide area. After passing a small creek we then forked left off the trail and onto the boulder field. From here it was a bit of scrambling up trying to figure out the way to Wiseman Lake. This route seemed not very well known, although fortunately Sebas had been there before. Above us were cliffs with a class 3 access point, which we carefully ascended. Sebas Leading the Way Eric going through Slide Alder One of the Class 3 Sections Going up the Snow Slope Getting Close to Lake Wiseman The Sun Setting over the Twin Sisters As the sun set, Mount Baker and the Black Buttes were looking fabulous. We could see pinks and reds across the sky, and on the other side of the horizon the moon setting. At lake Wiseman we set up camp quickly before it got dark. We all set out for our choirs, I was the water guy, while Sebas and Eric did the cooking. After coming back with the 10 liter water jug, it was time to have dinner. Sunset on the Black Buttes with Mount Baker Alpenglow on Mount Baker Setting up Camp During Sunset The Moon Setting Sun Colored Hills Alpenglow Rocks After having dinner we got warm in our sleeping bags, and Eric brought his book. Never before had I found it so interesting listening to someone read, I would hear out bursts of laughter and ""Oh that's too funny!"". After this we got some nice rest, unfortunately we slept in a bit too much... Day 5: Attempting South TwinWe woke up a little after the sunrise which we cooked breakfast and got ready for the day ahead of ourselves. We started out hiking around Lake Wiseman, up a saddle and then we ended up loosing a lot of elevation to go down to the lower basin in front of South Twin. From here we roped up in case we got onto the glacier at any point. Heading out in the Morning Sebas with Mount Baker Eric Approaching South Twin As we ascended the slope, we realized more and more that going this late in the day was a bad idea. Above us we could see a large snow break off right along our planned pathway, Eric was not feeling too good about the idea. As we climbed higher the snow got steeper, we had to cross a bit of a narrow section in the snow field to cross onto the glacier. To my left was a moat, and to my right was a cliff which I made sure to make each step nice and solid. But we all realized that the snow had softened up significantly, and that snow/rock fall hazard was becoming more evident. So we made a group decision and decided to turn around. No hard feelings, after all we needed to get down in time to get our permit for Mount Shuksan. We quickly hiked back to camp, packed our gear and went down the mountain. Coming back down the way we came in was not quite ideal considering the class 3 scrambles with heavy back packs on, but when trying a new route down we ended up at a very steep section. So Sebas set up an anchor and we repelled down. Looking Down Below Repelling Down the Forest Besides the bush whacking to the trail it was pretty much smooth hiking to the car. From here we got to the ranger station about 5 minutes or so before they closed. In a sense we were lucky we did not get the summit. Day 6: Getting Sketched out on Mount ShuksanOn the ride to Mount Shuksan we all were wondering what route we should take up it, for the longest time the North Face seemed like it would be the one. When we got to the ""parking lot"" (it was more like a grassy pull out) we had a great view of the route. Looking up at it I just couldn't help thinking ""wow, this is quite the route"". I was intimidated looking up at the face, not quite sure what I was up against. Mount Shuksan's North Ridge After re-thinking over the plans we finally decided that it would be best to for the Fisher Chimneys because at least then we would not have to go through massive bush whacking. So we drove on over to the Mount Baker Ski area, which to our luck did not require a Northwest forest pass (I left my pass at home on accident). At the parking lot this is where we met up with Ski. From the beginning he was a entertaining guy with lots of funny things to say and amazing plans like climbing the North Ridge of Mount Baker. He convinced our group into making this a 1 day trip, which I agreed with because Eric said there was a 10% chance of rain, and many people from the Northwest know that the weather is hard to predict around here. So when you know things could get bad, you gotta make sure you avoid the bad weather as fast as possible. While cooking dinner and have good talks, suddenly a cat came by. Never in all my mountaineering have I seen a cat already in the mountains come to me asking for attention. I gave it a good petting, washed my hands with snow, and then went on to get some rest for the morning ahead. Mount Shuksan with a Cat The Messy Parking Lot At 1:18 a.m. I woke up a few minutes before the alarm in anticipation, I now could not sleep and had to get ready for the climb ahead. After packing up all our gear we started out for Mount Shuksan. At first we had a pathway in the snow which soon disappeared, around Austin Pass we were slightly confused on which way to go. Fortunately I could make out Mount Shuksan's shadow and figure out exactly what valley we had to go down, after all I been here before. We lost a good 1,000 or so feet going down the valley from the high point we were on. Finding the way to Ann lake was better than I had expected in the dark, near the lake we went through a gap section in the cornice covered ridge which was a friendly hike to. From here this is when the trip started getting more interesting. Mount Shuksan in the Morning Ski and Sebas near Lake Ann From here we put on our crampons, harness's, and helmets. Eric offered to give Sebas the map because he considered turning around because he did not want to slow down there climb, but Sebas convinced him to continue and to keep the map. After heading over the hill we got a good view of the route ahead, for most of the night it had been clear, although now a few clouds could be seen on the horizon. Mount Shuksan had a lenticular cloud over the summit which already had us wondering if the weather would hold up. Lenticular Forming High up on Shuksan Looking up at the Lenticular Cloud over Shuksan We traversed a bit of a steep zone near the cliffs on Shuksan, I found out very quickly that the snow had not fully froze that night and was semi-loose. After down climbing a section I looked behind me which I could see a dark cloud head wall from the North to the South. Bad weather was inevitable at this point. It was a moment that was to beautiful, yet a bit frightening. To the left I could see Mount Baker glowing from the sunrise which stole my attention for a few moments. Sunrise on Mount Baker Alpenglow on Sherman Peak Storm Coming In The Sun Rise Looking West After one last slope traverse we reached a section where we had to go straight up. It had a bit of a rock section, which they climbed first without too much difficulty. Ski made a snow bollard to use for belaying us up. To get the rope down he attached a large stick to it, the stick looked as if it was going to land on us, but fortunately went down right where he threw it. First Eric went up, then me. This was the first time that I have climbed on rock with crampons. I thought of a scene from Touching the Void which even though I was roped up, it may have been a false sense of security (who knows, perhaps it would have held well). When unclipping from the rope Eric and I did not feel comfortable on the slope we were on. Below us was the rock wall we went up with a moat at the bottom and more steep snow below that. After scrambling 20 feet on exposed loose rocks, Eric finally announced ""Guys, I'm turning around. I don't feel comfortable with this kind of mountaineering"". We all understood, in that very second I almost said ""I'm going down with him"" but then looked back up the mountain and thought ""he will make it back down alright, you still have a shot at Mount Shuksan"". It was right then that I was battling my guilty conscience against what I should do. What would Eastking do? For sure he would do the right thing and make sure that Eric would not go down alone. Sebas and Ski were already ahead by this point which I figured ""I'll base my decision on if I can catch up to them in time"". Just as I was heading up on the snow slope I had my ice axe nicely plunged in and I tripped on one of my prussik cords that I thought was tucked away. This put me in a instant panic. I caught myself, untangled my crampon from the cord, and had to take a quick rest. I had nearly fallen down the mountain which would have been very serious. It was right in this moment that I figured ""It just wasn't meant to be, this is not worth risking everything for."" It was right here that I had made one of my greatest mountaineering decisions of all time. For obvious reasons too! Heading up towards the Wall Climbing up the Rock Section Just because we were turning around didn't mean we were safe yet. We had some steps we had to kick to get a ways down the snow field which there was a repel ring to the left. As usual I found myself down climbing snow that was not ideal. The gloves I was wearing were not the greatest which my hands were becoming very cold. As I climbed across the slope I would bang them together only to have regained enough heat in them to have what many climbers call the screaming barfies. My hands felt horrendous by this point, but I knew I had to keep climbing, the sun had already risen and a storm was on it's way in. I knew that my ice would not save me on this slope which is why I took my time carefully kicking in steps. When I got to the repel anchor, Eric went first, and then myself. From here travel was much friendlier. It's always an amazing feeling knowing that your going to get off the mountain alive. Clouds Building up on Mount Shuksan Swirling Clouds over Mount Shuksan The Cornice we had to go Around Eric heading down the Mountain As we hiked down the cloud deck came down as well which above I could see a swirling cloud. ""I sure hope they turn around soon"" I told Eric. We rushed down to the basin, back over Austin Pass and then down to the car. We got back to the car just in time! At first it started out as a light rain, but a few minutes later it was pouring down rain. It was a moment of irony, I had ran out of water and was very thirsty, yet I did not want to hike a mile or more to a lake because I did not want to get completely soaked if we had the possibility of staying overnight. By Day 6 My feet were Getting Blistered After sleeping for 3 hours I woke up which Eric figured they would be back at 3 p.m., I knew better that it would take much longer. I just couldn't help worrying for them. When hours more passed I spoke with someone in the parking lot which they told me that I should call search and rescue by 9 p.m. While sitting in the car I could hear an avalanche off of table mountain which assured me that the snow conditions up on Shuksan were not good. I knew that one of two things were happening. 1: One (or both) of them got injured up on the mountain from a fall, avalanche, ect. 2: They were going through some crazy mountaineering. I had spent hours looking outside just wondering how they were, I had feelings of regret that perhaps I should have told them that a storm was coming and that conditions were not ideal. They also had minimal gear on and did not have a map. This was because when we separated Eric had the map which Sebas already was a ways up the slope by the time Eric announced his plans. At 7 p.m. a van came by which to my amazement Ski and Sebas made it down alive! ""Halfway down the White Salmon Glacier, the tracks that Sebas and I had been following suddenly disappeared into thin air. We were on a massive rock outcropping overlooking what we could only hope was where the White Salmon river drainage basin- however, in our white prison, all we could make out off that desolate cliff was a lifeless void in which we would have to descend further in. After probing around in earnest for the our boot-track lifeline, I informed Sebas that I had some, eherm, buisness to attend to. He plodded away in that forsaken fog and I skirted the cliff for a better view to do my business with. After finishing, I was just in the process of lashing my harness on when I heard a sound I will never forget. Through the fog, somewhere, I heard Sebas yell ""WATCH OUT!!!"" What I am now going to describe will never come close to the amount of fear that Sebas and I experienced in that next minute. Through that desolate fog came the first of them- rock boulders, ice refrigerators and every medium in between came rushing down with the speed of ballistic missiles and the sound of a banshee. I was petrified. I couldn't react. I was exposed- I had nothing to hide behind. All of my close call in life had finally caught up with me. I clutched my ice tool tightly and faced my attacker in wonder at his power. Finally, the gears of my mind succumbed to the adrenaline dump I was experiencing. I ambled to a snow prow that was somehow deflecting some of the ice missiles, despite its minute size. I hastily anchored myself in and watched in absolute horror as a human-sized boulder crashed down right where Sebastian was shouting down at me. At that moment my heart sank. He was dead. He had to be. What now? What now. ARE YOU OKAY I yelled this right as the final volley came to a rest. I was shaking so badly my crampons were skittering across the rock I was standing upon. YES!! I'm OKAY. Oh man, I was so happy to hear he had made it, I could have cried. I sprinted across the debris field to embrace my friend. He was shaking as bad as I was!!! The devastation was awesome. Branches and brush were crushed and crumpled about him. We shared mutual stories of near death! It was all too real right then. It took us several minutes to calm down enough to resume our search for the tracks. We had to get home."" -Ski's account of the Intense Climb (The next few Photos by Sebas and Ski) Ski on the Summit of Mount Shuksan Escaping the Fisher Chimneys Getting Lost in the Woods ""Dude! You wouldn't believe what we went though today"" Sebas announced. When Ski told the story of there climb I felt as though held in suspense just being a listener of it. They said it was some of the most scary climbing they ever did. They went from one moment worrying about steep snow slopes to having avalanches come between them and many other crazy events. A few minutes later they quickly wanted out of the Mount Baker area which we all hurried over to Bellingham to enjoy some nice warm pizza! It was a great celebration to a crazy day! Day 7: Return to Crater Mountain and BeyondI got home at 4:30 a.m. in the morning which left me enough time to back up for the next trip and get a few hours of sleep. In the morning Craig picked me up and we went over to the North Cascades. ""Final Round"" I whispered to myself on the car ride there. When we got to the trail head it was 2:00 p.m. The trail this time had more vegetation over grown than it did before. At the big creek crossing we had to take off our footwear, the water was very cold, although manageable. The trail now had water running through it, which meant that it was time to ditch my approach shoes and swap to boots (Boy did I miss those shoes, my boots continue to make my blisters worse each trip). The trail got a little trickier to find by this point due to the heavy snow patches, but fortunately I knew the general direction which was just enough to be able to find the trail every 2 minutes (we would temporary lose it over and over). As we traversed around the mountain I saw my old glissade tracks from days earlier, which finding the high point by now was much easier. At the high point we decided it was the best place to put up our camp. Right after I set up the tent I took off my boots and socks to air them out, just as I was taking off my last sock I hear a ""Josh! The Tent!!!"". A gust of wind blew it away from us and continued to make it start flying down the mountain. Immediately I instantly got up and started running for it which 150 feet or so by our camp site it got caught on a rock. You could tell that it only had a few more seconds before it would continue to blow down the mountain which literally right next to the rock was a cliff it would have went down. I caught it just in time and grasped it as hard as I could. I then brought it back to camp. Craig Heading up A Nice Place to Camp The View to the East The spot which I finally caught my tent After setting our gear inside the tent I finally felt the impact and scratches on my feet from running on rocks bare foot. Looking outside our tent we could see more clouds building up which I figured the weather would remain bad the next day. Fortunately our luck was in... Day 8: Heading up to High Camp on JackIn the morning it was a bright sunny day with little wind on the tent. ""Josh, you gotta come see this"" Craig told me excitedly as I was starting to wake up. Outside I could see that we were above the clouds, Jack mountain as well as a few others were also in view. I now was excited because this meant that it was going to be a good day. Craig with Jack Mountain Above the Clouds The View Above the Clouds Jack Mountain with the Lake Below Morning Clouds on Crater Mountain We packed up our gear and started the descent towards Jack Mountain. There was a little bit of scrambling down to get to the lake. At the lake this was a great place to filter water for what we had ahead of us. After filling up water, we traversed the lower section of Crater Mountain. At the next pass we had to go all the way down into the Jerry Lake's basin and then all the way back up another hill. Good thing mountaineering is my pleasure. Craig Filtering Water Traversing the bottom of Crater Mountain The Way to Jack Mountain After climbing over another saddle we could finally see the whole view of Jack Mountain. We now had another 1,000 feet to go down. ""Wow this mountain sure has a lot of up and down"" I told Craig, he replied ""And to think we have about 2,500+ for the way back!"". So once again we went down into another basin which finally we were on the foot of Jack Mountain! From here it was a work out to get to Camp 2 which took another 1.5 hours or so of hiking up. At about 7,000 feet high we set up our camp, this time putting our gear in right away to make sure that the tent would not blow away. Jack Mountain with Clouds Rising The Views to the South While sitting at camp a chipmunk visitor came to our camp, which at first my thoughts were ""oh how cute"", but a little while later he bit into my bag of food which was limited. I was forced to scare it away which normally I hate to do with wildlife, especially one as cute as this guy. For the rest of the after noon Craig cooked up food and melted up snow using his black coat to help melt the snow in bottles on a rock because we were low on stove fuel. Looking up at Jack Mountain I was a bit intimidated by the cliff bands and the steep snow gullies further up. I heard that the rock part was class 3/4 which at first I had a hard time believing until I heard about that we could not see the gully we were going up. Sneaking into Our Camp Oh So Cute! This guy is Grabby After having dinner I went inside the tent to rest up, which I rubbed my noise. At first I noticed a few drops of blood coming out, and before I knew it, it was leaking like blazes. I pressed it against my knee to keep as much pressure on it. Unfortunately even that was not enough which it then soaked that spot of my pants in blood as well as my thermal pants. ""Craig. Craig, do you mind sparing me some toilet paper"" my voice was muffled from having to press against my knee. ""I thought you just went a little while ago"" Craig yelled back. ""No, not for that, I have an issue on my hands"". Craig came in the tent which he immediately handed me the paper which I used to prevent as much blood loss as possible. I spent about 20 minutes holding it until finally it hardened enough to sustain itself and I could make slow movements again. I then had to take my shell pants off and wash off my face with snow as well as a few other things. Fortunately after this things became uneventful and we soon got some rest for the climb up Jack Mountain. Day 9: Making a Attempt, and Going back Home!We woke up at 4:00 a.m. in the morning which I had oat meal and a quick snack before the climb. After walking to the snow area we put on our helmets, crampons and our ice axes. The sunrise to the Northeast was very impressive which there were reds, purples, and oranges. A Beautiful Sunrise on Jack Mountain I immediately was already feeling like this was becoming exciting fast. To my left was a very steep slope and a drop off beyond that, when I got onto the ice I then started to get a little scared. Normally in mountaineering when dealing with a steep icy traverse I usually kick in steps, but there is no way we would be able to climb the mountain in time if we did that. So we had to make sure every step was solid on the ice. There was no kicking in steps, the ice axe did not plant in, and there was no margin for error. I was actually thankful of the idea that when we come back that the snow would soften up here making this part much easier. I normally hate soft snow on steep slopes, especially after being on Mount Shuksan. The Steep Slope Below The Sunrise on the Peaks to the South Alpenglow on Jack Mountain As we traversed the slope the snow slightly softened up which when I pounded hard enough I could get my ice axe in. This made me feel so much better, now I felt as though I could travel more safely, although sometimes I could not get it in on some spots. We decided to avoid a steep section by going to to the moat for a little bit, when pounding in the ice axe I felt like I had to be a Jack Hammer to get it in. It was hard work to pound the axe in after every movement on the slope, but it was better than not having it in. Looking Below me from the Moat At the moat we then traversed along side it for a while until the upper section became steep again. At this point I was ahead of Craig which I decided to go along the side one of the many mini gullies on the mountain. I was now pounding in steps hard because I was not on a ideal slope, every time I rested my knee on the slope I would make a big blood stain in the snow from all the blood the previous day that got on my thermal pants. Well at least this helped clean it off for me. Anyways as I climbed higher I could feel myself growing weaker, I had already gone too far up this to down climb it. Suddenly above me I could see ice chunks coming down right next to me from way above. I quickly looked around at all my surroundings and realized I was in a rock fall spot. I had to focus less on good footing and more on speed now. I felt as though the clock was ticking and I had to get out of this spot as soon as possible. As I neared the top of the ice gully there was a mini water fall above which froze over parts on the snow in front making it very difficult to plant in my axe. I decided when I could finally make it into the snow gully itself I quickly traversed and got onto the rocks. I was relieved that I was now out of the most dangerous part of the face. Although I was still in a rock fall hazard zone, before I was in a position which if I saw rocks tumbling I would either have to let them hit me or go sliding down the mountain in dangerously high speeds. Class 3/4 Section Above my Turn Around Spot The Route I took Up    Once I took a rest I heard Craig yelling back to me from way below ""Josh... (muffled voice)"". I had a hard time hearing him because of the water fall near by me distorting his voice. Turns out he was yelling home over and over, I would yell back ""What was that, I can't hear you"". Then he yelled back ""Lynnwood"". I immediately knew what this meant, it was time to back down which I carefully down climbed a different way from when I came up and down a much friendlier rock scramble down. Then I down climbed snow which had softened up a bit by now. Craig made a good choice here, the snow conditions were turning bad pretty fast. For much of the trip down climbing was at least as hard as climbing up hill, but now it suddenly became much easier and even a bit fun. I was getting a adrenaline rush from it, when doing it in such fast speeds it makes you feel more alive. Now I knew that if I fell I would not get injured which was a relief, although it was still steep below. Craig had short spiked crampons which he said a few times he had to catch himself. After kicking in some nice steps we eventually traversed over for a hour and off of the South Face. I then took off my crampons and helmet and dashed to camp. When I finally got to sit and relax I couldn't help but keep laughing at the thought that I had lived out such a tremendous adventure. You have to live it to know what it's like. I did not one bit regret turning around and not making the summit, after all I feel as though we lived out what true mountaineering is about. Myself on the lower South Face Down Climbing From here we started the long descent back home after packing up our gear. Fortunately the glissades down the mountain were very good, but then it was back to the up hill game again which we had to gain 1,000 or so feet to get up the next saddle. We then down climbed the soft snow which at the bottom we once again came across another glissade zone. Crater Mountain Reflection At Jerry Lakes Craig filtered water for the rest of the way home, drinking fresh water again was very refreshing. All around I could see cloud build up which had me a bit worried, Craig said her heard thunder in the distance. As we traversed Crater Mountain we could see rain clouds to the north, and even Jack Mountain now had dark clouds hovering over it. Above Crater Mountain I could see a anvil like cloud forming, but fortunately we never got caught in any bad weather. On the way back to camp 1, we took a longer route thinking it would be a lesser slope, this turned out to be a minor mistake. Once we got to the ridge we hoped for a way around the mountain, unfortunately there were just cliffs in the way to the access to the other side. So we then had to go up and over the hill, but at least this was the last time we had to go up hill. Stormy Atmosphere over Jack Mountain Clouds Building over Crater Mountain Thunder Clouds Building in the East Spider on the Snow At the top of the hill we had one more round of glissading, and then it was time to find the trail. Our foot prints had melted out significantly to the point where even if you were looking at them you sometimes wouldn't even know it. Once we found our prints we followed them down the trail for a ways. Suddenly at one section they disappeared which had both of us wondering, after looking around in the woods for about 10 minutes we finally gave up and started heading in the general direction of where it might be. As we were going over brush and fallen over trees I started to worry about missing the trail, so I had us take a right and then down. Fortunately this was the right way, in fact it was almost perfect because when we got onto the trail we got to the spot where my approach shoes were. The rest of the way down the mountain was a nice trail back down to the car. One of the best things about ending a hike I always say is taking off your socks. My feet by this point were very blistered to the point where I was hobbling the next day. ""What an adventure!"" I whisper to myself as I fall asleep on the car ride home.

As for Shuksan, although I very much wanted to continue with the climb, I knew it would be a dangerous under taking. Even what I did was dangerous which I nearly stripped on one spot. I'm glad to hear your trip worked out just fine on Shuksan. I'll have to return one of these days. billisfree - Jul 17, 2011 8:47 am - Hasn't voted Great Stuff Thanks for sharing with us.

I think it's really good that you are cautious with summits and new technical terrain. It's real wisdom to learn at your own pace. I can tell you really love the Cascades because you aren't afraid of bushwhacking, obscure routes and deep forest. Looking forward to your missives from August! Josh Lewis - Jul 24, 2011 2:13 am - Hasn't voted Re: Unique perspective Thanks Michael. Just a few hours ago I got home from another 4 day North Cascade Extravaganza which now I still have 3 more climbing days ahead of me. My feet on the other hand are wanting rest. As the quote at the start of my trip reports say, getting down is the most important when mountaineering. I'm ambitious for climbing, but I very much value my life and do not like going beyond what is necessary to have a good time while being safe. As for bush whacking, I'm used to it by now ever since going through Mount Zekes. When I'm done climbing I have more stories to share.

single-day,"The Point of No Return: A Frightening Climbing Experience
Introduction ""When you're safe at home you wish you were having an adventure; when you're having an adventure you wish you were safe at home"" -Thornton Wilder ""A sense of uncertainty that is potentially fatal is what makes climbing an adventure. Anything less is just working out"" -Jim Bridwell This was one of the most frightening climbing experiences I have ever had. My brother and I had to put our mountaineering skills to the test using what we could to get out with our lives. There are climbs were you anticipate danger and those that you think would be nothing more than a simple scramble up. I had under estimated the dangers, the time it would take, but most importantly the mountain. I hope never in my wildest dreams to ever climb anything like this again. I had seen Mount Stickney for years from my roof top which my brother and I felt like this was a mountain that had to be climbed. The best weather day happen to fall on the darkest day of the year making any attempts be done in speedy time. After making careful observations using photographs and google earth I found a steep gully that went up Stickney's South West Face. This appeared to be an unclimbed route which I've always wanted to get a first ascent of a new route up a mountain. But I got more than what I bargained for. Aproaching StickneyWe had a late start because I had to put money onto my bus card, making for a 9:30 a.m. start. The fact that we had breakfast at the last second I had forgotten to bring my ice axe which later ended up being a big deal. After riding a few buses we arrived at the city of Gold Bar at 11:09 a.m. which we immediately hopped on the bikes towards the Wallace Falls trailhead. As I was riding I noticed that I was getting a lot of friction due to my back tire being partly flat. My brother decided to let me use his bike and told me ""don't break my bike"" with a smile. I guess one could call me the Mr. Accident of gear because I'm well known for accidentally breaking gear whether it be a zipper or even an ice axe. Near the trailhead we started biking up a hill. As I was pedaling the chain on the bike suddenly snaps completely making the bike unusable. So much for mountain bikes being able to bike up a small hill. My brother was quite disappointed and used it as a scooter for the rest of the way. We stashed our bikes in the bushes and started jogging on the trail. After getting a bit soar we had to slow down to a speed walk which was still tiring. Exactly an hour from when we got off the bus we arrived at the upper Wallace Falls which I consider that we made good time. Running through the Woods Wallace Falls Middle Falls After a short hike up hill we were on the road that goes towards Wallace Lake. A ways before the lake we took a right turn which follows an abandoned forest road that has some fallen over trees on it. 2.5 miles later we were uncertain of where the route actually was considering that the woods were dense in this area. Michael Climbing over Fallen Trees After passing a old creek drainage I decided that it was time to start heading up. If it was the wrong one, it would be obvious after a few hundred feet. As we hike though the woods the route starts coming into view. Entering the Gully North Side of Mount Zekes Light Clouds coming Over Scrambling up the Start of the Gully The gully started out as a light scramble over rocks and dirt, eventually ending up on snow. We decided that it was best if we put on our crampons for better traction on the snow field which went up the rest of the way of the gully. There was a bit of going back and forth involved with navigating the gully. But for the most part it was a decent gully on the lower section. Michael Hiking up the Gully As we started approaching the upper part of the gully the snow got deeper in places, but did not require snowshoes. When looking up it seemed as though we could top out within 20 minutes. Boy was that a under estimation of the route... Looking up the Gully Climbing into Scary TerrainIt was now late in the day which now we had to make speedy time if we were to complete this route. The gully suddenly became much steeper which we should have turned around right then. We figured that perhaps this was some sort of crux and that after that section we could get to the trees and scramble up to the top of the ridge. A little ways into the snow climb we encountered a section I call ""The Hour Glass"" which is a narrow section of rock and snow having just enough room for one to climb past. The snow climbing started requiring several kicks in the snow/ice in order to be able to some what climb this safely. My brother Michael when he climbed in the hour glass had to climb into a moat just to proceed further. There was a mix of excitement and fear while climbing though. Looking up the Hour Glass Climbing up the Hour Glass After the Hour Glass things eased up a bit but every step still required much attention of kicking and good placements. I saw a rock section ahead which I was delighted that it seemed like the way out of the gully. Ironically it probably would have been better if we stayed in the steep gully later on. Looking down I knew that I broke the number one rule of mountaineering which is to never climb up something that you cannot down climb. Climbing on the Upper Section of the Gully Once we came close to the rocks we started to climb up onto the left side of the gully in hopes that things would start easing up. Things didn't, in fact it got steeper and scarier as we continued on. I soon started to realize that we were climbing ourselves into a trap. There was no going down because the sun was almost setting and the ice was starting to freeze over making our situation more serious. The kicks started requiring at times up to 20-30 kicks per step and with some of them more which was time consuming and exhausting. The terrain was looking so horrendous that I started wishing that I had never went on this adventure. Climbing towards the Ledges Near the top of where we were climbing there was a cliff which Michael decided he wanted to climb to the right of it. The end section of his plans looked terrible for me because I had no ice axe and the possibility of the ice being thin would be incredibly dangerous. The fact that I had small crampon spikes made the situation worse, although certainly better than nothing. I decided that for myself it would be best to try and traverse under the cliff using the ledges. The climb onto the cliff ledges was more dangerous than I had anticipated, the rock was loose making it so every step had to be carefully planned out. I found a ledge that I could finally get a drink on and take a few pictures (I know, pictures during a time like this. When I get nervous and have a spot to sit down on and rest, taking pictures help calm me down). I set down my pack on the ledge that had just enough room for it to stay stable which I scrambled the last part. At the top of the ridge I was horrified to find that there was nothing but steep couloirs below me and cliffs above me. There was no where to go, I suddenly felt trapped on terrain that was beyond my control. I seriously considered climbing a loose class 4 section that I might not have been able to down climb, but went against it because this was not the place to find out if one could proceed. Evening to the South Mount Stickney's Summit Block Sun Setting over Trees Looking West During Evening Mount Index during Evening Mount Rainier during Evening Looking Down Below Topping out at the Wrong Place (All further interest in Photography was lost due to heavy exposure) It was getting dark which I yelled to my brother who faintly heard me though the winds. He told me that he had topped out and was safe which in that sense I was glad. I yelled out several times asking if there was any way on the top of the ridge. My brother told me that he cried when he heard this because he knew that there was nothing. He yelled back ""No"" which I was terrified. Many people would have broken down in tears in the position I was in. I would have myself except that it goes against the rules of survival which is keep your cool when in a perilous situation. I couldn't believe my situation at first, it seemed so unreal to have to go through what I did next. I began going across what was the scariest traverse I have ever had to do. Many times when I went to go make a step the rock would go tumbling down the mountain. I first had to travel under a vertical rock with hardly any place to grip onto. I'm not entirely sure how I was able to pull it off which this was the place that I had to put all my mountaineering skills to the test. If there was a time to make sure you do everything right. This was it! I began getting into deep prayers for guidance of where to place my next move. In some places even when trying to hold my cool I became very shaky in my legs. The dehydration was starting to wear in making it so that I had cramps when ever I made a long step or had to kick in loose snow on ledge spots. When your in a desperate situation you come to find that you can do things you never quite thought you would have been able to do other wise. There came a section were it appeared as though there was no good holds and no way to traverse any further. I felt my heart racing and was looking all around for anything to grab onto, anything that would hold. The only way to proceed was some cheap step move that barely held me which before doing it you start having thoughts like ""if this doesn't hold, well I guess than it was my time anyways"". It felt as though it was a miracle to be able to get past that section. It was becoming quite dark making it hard to see. There would be times were I would have to dig snow out of my way and others were I had to dig rocks out of my way. After one last sketchy rock section I managed to scramble over to a tree hanging over a cliff. I was now able to finally put some layers on over my t-shirt and put on my head lamp. My brother was above me now which he did help kick many steps, but there was a section between him and I that he was too scared to climb. I finally announced ""Michael... I'm scared. In fact, scared is a under statement to what I am feeling right now"". Michael gave back this look of worry which he knew I had one last sketchy section to climb though. It took me a few minutes to find the courage for me to continue on with the climb. The snow became harder making it both more strenuous to kick in steps and less effective when I had the steps in. I was cramping up making me have to wait until I recovered. After what seemed like a long time I finally managed to make it to my brother which he handed me the ice axe to use for the rest of the section. The Long Way Home""Michael, let's not ever do anything like that again"" I told Michael. He relied ""Agreed"". We still had one last some what dangerous section that required a Z shaped format to down climb which I thank my brother for kicking in the steps for. Once we got past this part, the rest of going down was all safe, but not easy. Looking at the time it was 6 p.m. It had take over an hour to travel a couple hundred feet. I knew by this point that there was no hopes for us making it to the bus in time. It took us 12 hours of traveling through the dark to get back to Gold Bar. Sometimes we got a bit lost and at others had to go back up hill plowing through snow. With a day of intense climbing, plowing through snow was tiring by this point. We could not go straight down the mountain because of the many cliffs on the south face. Finding the road was our only reasonable option for going down. We kept coming upon flat areas with no trees which at first seemed like a road but would suddenly come to an end. Our pace steadily became slower as exhaustion settled in. Sometimes we had to lay down and take a nap just to be able to continue. We would wake up cold and have to hurry on to warm ourselves up. Eventually Michael got tired of plowing through snow on the ridge and finally decided to head down hill. If we hit a road, great! And if not, well there is not a lot we could do. Eventually we came across a old logging road which took us all the way near Wallace Lake. The road split off onto another road that went to Wallace Falls. From here it was a 2.5 mile walk to the trailhead. We biked the rest of the way to Gold Bar, arriving at 6 a.m. where we waited for the next bus back home. I am happy to be home typing this and hope never to get into this kind of situation again. Although I certainly don't recommend experiencing anything like this, it certainly makes one appreciate being safe at home and many other things that we all take for granted.

It sounds like it was a real hair-raising adventure. On the other hand, it seems like it wasn't really worth the risks that you two took. Many climbers would have turned around when they realized that they forgot their ice axe. I have had to turn around before for that reason myself. Smart climbers will learn from a situation like this and never take such risks again. But some climbers will never learn from their mistakes, and sadly, those are the ones who will eventually get themselves killed. I think it's totally natural for a developing climber to find himself in a bit of trouble like this. It's certainly happened to me over the years. But the important question is how will this affect your decisions in the future? Redwic - Dec 25, 2011 10:18 pm - Voted 10/10 Re: A Mixed Reaction Technically speaking, was the ""new route"" actually completed? It sounds like they reached a ridgetop (knowing that area a little bit, I think I can guess which one), but there was not any mention of reaching the summit. And judging by their descriptions, time, conditions, etc. I have doubts the summit was reached. This is perhaps a ""new route"" for reaching a particular ridgetop, but whether or not this is a feasible new route for the summit remains to be seen. But that is not to downgrade their experience or the difficulties within. But perhaps this type of experience is why most people approach this peak from totally different directions than this, and definitely with different conditions. I am glad they both got back safe and I really hope they both learn from this experience. I am also glad that they have enough humility and openness to share this experience with others. Please don't use this experience as a motivator to push to harder goals, Josh and Michael. You can only tempt fate for so long, and mountaineering already has enough risks with good conditions.

For example lets just say the Gib Ledges had never been attempted and Ingraham Direct was. You make it up the Gib Ledges and onto the Ingraham. You don't make it to the summit but I would say yes to the new route and no to summitting. However these technical aspects of climbing take away the pure joy of just getting out and being on the mountain. blakemj33 - Dec 28, 2011 2:47 pm - Hasn't voted Re: A Mixed Reaction Well said!!!!

multi-day,"Rainier -- Remove the asterisk! (DC)
BackgroundI met Ian through our common interest in bootfitting via participation in an online backpacking discussion forum. We had a few differences of opinion, but I knew immediately that Ian was an individual worthy of respect. After exchanging several ideas electronically, Ian and I had an opportunity to meet face-to-face when my wife Laura and I visited my brother in Ian’s home territory of Virginia. We met for a day of top-roping at a local D.C. area crag. Since it was one of my first outdoor rock climbing experiences, I paid close attention to how Ian set anchors and was impressed by his rope handling skills. I felt comfortable with Ian. I trusted his experience and his judgment. And from that day forward he became a sort of virtual mentor in my pursuit of climbing experience. After a few years of exchanging emails and phone calls (always with the idea in the back of my mind of climbing with Ian someday), I proposed a trip to climb Mount Rainier. I knew that Ian had attempted the mountain twice previously and had been forced to turn back both times before reaching the summit due to poor weather conditions among other factors. My own successful summit bid a year earlier had an asterisk associated with it, as we opted to turn back after reaching the crater rim but before reaching the highest point on the mountain due to poor visibility, 75+ mph winds, and an exhausted teammate. It appeared that our initial plans to climb Rainier together were falling through. But then I received an email from Ian saying that he and one of his climbing buddies (James) had tickets booked to Seattle and needed a third partner for the rope team. Coincidentally, I was already looking for something to climb that weekend, as Laura would be traveling out of town. I joined the team with excitement – both at the prospect of finally climbing with Ian and the opportunity to visit the majestic mountain yet again. The TripWednesday – Arrival and Departure We exchanged several emails in the planning stages of the trip (including several references to cheesy mountaineering movies that prompted me to rent a VHS player just so I could watch “K2”). The anticipation for me was realized when I picked up Ian and James Wednesday afternoon from the Seattle airport and we drove to Paradise, which looked like anything but paradise on this particular day. The spitting rain and cold wind served as a reminder of what the forecast predicted, but there was anticipated to be a break in the weather Thursday night and Friday as a ridge of high pressure moved in. We packed up and started hiking up into the uninviting, white atmosphere. Having been extremely busy at work over the past several days/weeks/months, I was concerned that my fitness level would not be sufficient to keep up with my fit marathon-ready partners. But I had the advantage of having hiked some vertical terrain in preparation for the climb. On the inclines that Ian and James complained of “feeling the burn,” I was wondering when the climbing was going to start. In hindsight, I could have prevented two swift kicks in the butt had I not verbalized this sentiment to my partners. We hiked up through the whiteness until it was obvious the sunlight was diminishing before we stopped to find a place suitable to make camp. We pitched the tent just above Pebble Creek, feeling healthy but tired. Except for James. He had been working long hours too, but with the early morning flight and the three-hour time change, he had been active for nearly twenty-four hours with only a couple hours of sleep the night before. He vomited after we reached camp and complained of a headache. Acute Mountain Sickness may show up as low as 5,000 feet in some people, but this was the lowest I’d seen anybody experience it. Unfortunately, there is no way to predict the who, when or where of altitude sickness. James had been higher several times previously without similar symptoms. Anticipating that James would feel better after some rest at the current elevation, we ate, drank, and climbed into the tent under a starless canopy of clouds. After several hours of warm, peaceful sleep – broken only by occasional sleet pelting the tent – I awoke to the sun trying to burn off the thick layer of clouds. I peeked out of the tent and saw that the sun was doing a pretty good job of it. Unfortunately, James was not able to get the rest he needed as he spent a near sleepless night struggling with his discomfort. Thursday – Splitting up We slept in late on Thursday morning, allowing James to rest and recuperate. He felt physically better late in the morning, but still was not 100% and felt a bit anxious about the climb. He agreed to attempt the rest of the hike to Muir, but was pretty certain he would not be joining us on our summit attempt. After some hot soup for breakfast, we broke camp and started hiking up. It soon became apparent that James needed to go back down. Ian and I were ready to stash our packs and hike back down with him to safety before returning to pick up our packs and finish the hike to Camp Muir. Fortunately, a descending hiker agreed to walk back down with James. (This hiker turned out to be Todd Burleson – an accomplished mountaineer with several successful Everest summits who happened to be on his way to catch a flight to lead a Denali expedition.) Ian and I divided the remaining food and group gear that we’d need and sent James down with as much as we felt he could safely handle. The drawback here is that we packed food for up to four days for three people; we had a three-person tent, a three-person cookset, and fuel for three people. Among three people, the weight isn’t bad, but split amongst the two of us, my pack felt burdensome. It was easily the heaviest load I had ever carried up a hill. We arrived at the 10,080 ft Camp Muir around 5:00 PM – later than we would have liked, but still early enough to allow us some rest before a summit attempt early the next morning. After hiking up through clouds, the skies finally opened to reveal sun and bright blue hues. It appeared as though the extended forecast was accurate, and our window of clear weather was arriving right on target. We cooked dinner, melted water, and prepared our gear for an early morning alpine start. We opted to stay in the public shelter to maximize our available time. We were in bed shortly after 9:00 PM. Friday – The Ascent We awoke just before 2:00 AM to groaning, clanking and hissing as other climbers woke up, prepared their gear and cooked their breakfast before starting the summit bid. After the initial activity, Ian and I rolled out of our bags, made some hot soup and packed up. The night sky above was crystal clear as the snow crunched beneath our feet. The stars were spectacular as we watched the line of white headlamps slowly ascend the Cowlitz Glacier on the route out of Muir. We commenced our journey to the upper mountain shortly after 3:30 AM. We crossed the unbroken Cowlitz and picked our way up the Cathedral Rocks, reaching the area of Ingraham Flats just as the sun was beginning to tease the horizon. We were treated to a spectacular sunrise over Little Tahoma, with a sea of clouds far below us. That is one of those views that you can’t easily experience anywhere except on the side of a mountain after an alpine start! Like the feeling of a perfect swing in golf, it’s one of the things that keeps me coming back for more! We saw some climbers ascending the Ingraham Direct route, but having heard that crevasses on that route were opening up and with a freshly made boot trail on the Disappointment Cleaver route, we opted for the Cleaver. We crossed the Ingraham Glacier and clipped into the recently placed fixed lines to gain the Cleaver. Rockfall is a potential hazard during this part of the climb, but the rocks were content to lie still that morning. Looking at the steep cliffs just a bit farther down the slope, I was thankful for the security offered by the fixed lines that helped to prevent a minor misstep from turning into a major catastrophe on this exposed section of the route. Once we had gained the cleaver, we ascended a steep snow slope protected by a few running belays left by other teams on the mountain. We scrambled up a couple steep rocky sections before hitting the snow field on the Cleaver. We ascended this to 12,400 feet, where we encountered our first crevasse crossing as the route left the Cleaver and joined the big Emmons Glacier. The snow bridge was protected by pickets. It was a little intimidating staring down into the gaping crevasse, but we crossed without issue. We followed the boot path as it traversed farther to climber’s right on the Emmon’s Glacier before we started climbing again. This traverse avoids the large crevasses above the Cleaver. Around 13,000 feet, I noticed that Ian was slowing down. I asked if he was feeling okay, and he said that he had a bit of a headache, but nothing out of the ordinary. He said he would be fine. I was a bit concerned, but Ian was an experienced mountaineer and was completely lucid. It was obvious that he was working harder than he had been lower on the mountain, but so was I. That is a common experience at higher elevations. I trusted his judgment that he’d be okay, but I kept a close eye on him to watch for any further symptoms. A bit higher, I noticed that Ian was struggling a bit to keep going. I asked him again how he was feeling. He responded that he would be fine. He seemed a bit agitated… not so much at me, but rather at his body’s unwillingness to cooperate with his intentions. He caught a bit of the flu from his young son before leaving for the trip, and that certainly wasn’t helping him high on the mountain. After seeing Ian continue to fight against his body, I asked him again how he was feeling. When he assured me for the third time that he would be fine and would be able to make it up, I reminded him to keep some reserves for the descent, too. I expressed my concern at his condition, and I considered suggesting that we turn back to play it safe. Though I wanted to reach the summit, I was concerned about our ability to return safely to Muir. The sun was getting warm and the few snow bridges we crossed were only going to get weaker. I wondered what some of the steep sections would look like descending the Cleaver. I believe I would have turned back were it not for my respected partner’s resolve to continue pushing higher. Knowing that Ian prefers to climb conservatively and is not prone to summit fever, I once again trusted his judgment. We continued to climb and passed a few cheerful descending parties who encouraged us, telling us that the summit was just around the corner. We wished them a safe descent. I scoffed a bit when they said the crater was just a few minutes away. I had been checking my altimeter on the way up, and it was now showing 13,500 feet – still nearly 1,000 vertical feet from the top. Only when we were looking down into the crater about ten minutes later did I realize that my altimeter was on ‘hold’ at 13,500. I reset it and saw it jump to over 14,000! The crater was inviting and warm, with bright blue windless skies above. A few other parties were basking in the warm sun as they rested before their descent. We stopped to rest and chat briefly with a guide before crossing the crater to reach the true summit of Columbia Crest at 14,411 feet. We were moving slowly, and I suggested removing our packs and unclipping from the rope in order to move more freely. Ian didn’t like that suggestion because the way he had the excess rope coiled and his prussiks attached made it difficult to unclip. Being tired myself and wanting to feel refreshed, I convinced him to do it anyway. Only afterward did I realize that it may have been easier for him to stay clipped in. We clambered up the remaining five minutes to Columbia Crest and briefly enjoyed the 360 degree views. We could see peaks well into Oregon and beyond Mount Baker to the north – possibly as far north as Canada. The summit photos attest to how exhausted Ian was by this point, so we kept our visit at the top short. We exchanged a high-five and snapped a few shots. Then I silently thanked Rainier for allowing us to safely reach her summit (removing my asterisk) and we began our arduous descent. Friday – The Descent As we were leaving the crater, we chatted briefly with another party who had ascended the Ingraham Direct route. They were considering descending the Disappointment Cleaver route to avoid some of the sketchy snow bridges on the ID. Hearing this, I quietly asked them to keep an eye out for us on the descent, indicating that Ian wasn’t feeling 100%. They nodded their agreement. It was already 11:00 AM by the time we left the crater. Ian mentioned that he was ready for a speedy descent, and I agreed, but indicated that I would prefer a safe descent over a speedy one. If we could have both – then great! As it turned out, we were moving quite slowly. I asked Ian to lead on the descent so that I could keep a watchful eye out and arrest any slips or falls. I still felt physically strong, but knew my muscles were getting tired. The anxiety I felt descending with only one partner – who was feeling less than ideal – didn’t allow me to relax. I was slightly distracted as my mind played out several “what if” scenarios. Since I was momentarily not paying attention and moving faster than Ian, the rope became slack and interfered with Ian’s footwork. A couple stern reminders from Ian to watch the rope were all I needed to return my focus to the present and keep my eye on him and the rope. I saw the party behind us descending. They were still far back, but I anticipated that they would quickly pass us at the rate we were moving. After an hour passed and they hadn’t gained much ground, I suspected they were holding back a bit in order to keep an eye on us from above. When they finally caught up at the snow bridge to the top of the Cleaver, it became apparent that the three of them were exhausted and in need of some rest. Because they were not familiar with the descent of the Cleaver, they asked if they could descend with us. Though we wanted to keep moving to get Ian to safety as quickly as possible, we agreed to hold up for a few minutes while they rested. So, here we were… five of us… late on a hot afternoon, descending the Disappointment Cleaver. Ian was severely dehydrated and we were nearly out of water. He had a splitting headache and did not have much left in reserves. The other team was unsure of the route, dehydrated and entirely exhausted. At this point, I was the only one feeling strong physically and my reserves were beginning to be tapped, too. I felt confident that we would make it down safely at this point, but I still couldn’t help feeling some anxiety at the situation. I wondered why I ever enjoyed climbing in the first place. At that moment, it wasn’t much fun. We set out a minute or two ahead of the other team to minimize risk of falling rocks or other objects from above. The descent of the snow field to the right of the rocky spine we had climbed proved to be the most physically demanding section of the entire climb. With both of us tired already, we plunged through soft, mashed potato snow up to our knees (and sometimes our waist) for about 1,000 vertical feet. Every single step required strained mental concentration and physical effort. It was a huge relief to finally reach the fixed ropes that led us off the Cleaver and onto the Ingraham Glacier. Knowing that the rest of the route posed minimal hazard, I finally was able to relax. I confirmed that the party above us was still doing okay, and we kept on pushing. Near Ingraham Flats, I took one final drink of water and gave the rest to Ian, who obviously needed it more than I did. When passing the climbers camped there, I suggested to Ian that we ask for a cup or two of water for him, but he grunted a negative response and kept pushing. By the time we reached Cathedral Gap, Ian was moving even more slowly. We removed our crampons and I stuffed his daypack and gear inside my pack to minimize his burden. We continued the last part of the descent to Camp Muir at a snail’s pace. Finally, after seven hours of climbing and nearly six hours descending, we arrived at Muir. Ian immediately crashed on the wooden floor of the public shelter. I set out to find someone willing to share a liter of water for Ian right away to tide him over until I was able to melt some snow. The rangers proved to be extremely friendly and helpful in our hour of need. After rehydrating some, but not able to keep down any food, Ian curled up in his sleeping bag. He drifted in and out of sleep/consciousness, groaning and snoring for the next several hours. Whenever he was awake, I reminded him to keep drinking, but could not get him to eat anything. I stored up enough water for both of us, cooked myself some dinner, then we both got some much needed rest for the night. Saturday – Return to Paradise We awoke on Saturday morning to howling 40+ mph winds and blowing snow. The expected front had moved in more quickly than anticipated. Ian still was not feeling well, and we knew we had to find a way to get him down soon. I kept in touch with the rangers at Camp Muir, relaying Ian’s condition. Once again they were extremely helpful with information and offers of assistance. I learned from the rangers that the weather was only expected to worsen over the course of the next two or three days, but that currently the winds and snow would likely diminish just a thousand feet lower on the mountain. This was evidenced by the fact that we could actually see Paradise from above. There was a large group of novice climbers in the public shelter that was debating whether to descend or wait out the weather. After I relayed what I had learned from the rangers, we all agreed to descend through the white-out to Paradise. We certainly had no desire to stay on the mountain any longer. Ian and I had stuffed all of our gear into our packs. Ian was obviously in pain, but had a steely resolve about him. He had taken some codeine to take the edge off. We discussed crafting a sled from a sleeping pad in order to haul his pack, but he was determined to carry it himself. We were the first party to leave the shelter, and the others followed shortly after. The wind-driven snow/sleet pelted us. The gusts were schoolyard bullies, constantly shoving us and knocking us around. But as the rangers had anticipated, the wind and snow lessened as we descended. Whether from the codeine or from the lower elevations, Ian began to regain some strength. In fact, there were sections that I started to fall behind his increasing pace. We were able to enjoy a few short glissades on the way down, which saved some energy and provided some much needed fun! Though the weather was only marginally better than when we first arrived at the mountain a few days before, Paradise was much more inviting on the descent! By 10:00 Saturday morning, we had returned. We removed our packs and breathed a great sigh of relief. Then we began the adventure of locating James, who had our vehicle and was presumably somewhere in the state of Washington. Negotiating weak cell signals, broken payphones, a collect call to a sister-in-law with a request to call James for us, and unanswered text messages, we could do nothing else but wait. When James walked through the door, I never thought I’d be so happy to see someone I’d only known for three days! As we were driving down the road from Paradise, I looked back toward the mountain… obscured by clouds. I was already forgetting the suffering of the past few days and was wondering when I would return to this majestic place to climb again. Images View Rainier -- Remove the asterisk!

multi-day,"Booyah! Having a Ball on the Ptarmigan Traverse
Introduction ""You can take the man out of the woods, but you can't take the woods out of the man"" -Gary Paulsen This was the most exciting adventure of the year. I had been wanting to do the Ptarmigan Traverse for a very long time. From having an attempt on this route and climbing Dome Peak the previous year I knew both ends of the traverse quite well. But hidden within a fortress of mountains lied a handful of surprises. The traverse included miles of glacier travel, white out conditions, steep snow climbing, rappelling off a cornice, navigation, and one of the worst bush whacks I have ever done. By the end of the adventure my feet were the most shredded they ever have been in my entire life! I'm still taking antibiotics and taking it easy. The trip began when Eric Darsow emailed me while I was on a Beartooth Range adventure. I immediately agreed knowing that any opportunity at this would be too great to pass up. The weather forecast was calling for perfect weather which I was shocked. For many years it's been terrible weather during early July. But as fate goes, somethings are too good to be true. Fortunately the adventure went well beyond my expectations and took me into one of the most remote places in Washington. This was well worth the years of waiting. Day 1: The Journey BeginsAfter staying up until 4 a.m. packing and researching I get some well deserved rest. In the morning I head on to my math class and head back home shortly before Eric Darsow arrives. Considering that we didn't have a bike rack we placed both bikes on top of the car with a blanket and bungie cables. After a few hours of driving and chatting we were at the Suiattle trailhead. On the way we ditched our packs to save effort while biking down the 12 mile road. After having a few more mini donuts and some final packing we set off for the Ptarmigan Traverse. The 12 miles was mostly moderate with many down hills. As I picked up speed I couldn't help but smile as the wind rushed on me. Excitement was now roaring, I knew this was going to be an amazing experience. As we biked along I saw one of the strangest things I've ever seen. A fern plant appeared to be dancing back and forth in a wild like motion. I waited to see if an animal had bumped it, but I saw none. I guess one can see new things each time they enter the forest, even after years of seeing what they believe to be everything. Near the end of the road we picked up our packs from a huge ditch area and biked the rest with our heavy packs on. At the end of the road we ditched our bikes in the bushes. Getting on the other side of the road we pulled out our thumbs for the hitch hike section of the trip. ""An escalate will never pick us up"" Eric said. ""I know, but it's always worth a shot"" I laugh as I put down my thumb. After about an hour or so we were given a ride to Rockport. From Rockport we stayed for a while in attempts to get another ride. While we were waiting my buddy Gimpilator came by and had a quick chat with him. He would have helped us out, but not only was he going a different direction, but it wasn't even his car. Hitch Hiking to Marblemount After waiting another hour or so a truck driver gave us a ride to Marblemount right next to the Cascade River campground. We attempted to hitch hike up the Cascade Valley that evening. Even though it was a week day quite a few cars came by late in the day. Once it was sunset we finally gave up and Eric paid the man $10 to stay at the campground. I guess it pays off to bring money even on an adventure. Day 2: Approaching the MountainsWe started our hitch hiking attempts at 7 a.m. A little after two hours a nice woman gives us a ride 4 miles up the road. Every little bit counts. With as many vehicles that went by I figured we would have gotten a hitch. Eventually we realized no one was going to help us. Didn't matter if the truck beds were entirely open and it had little to do with how much space there was in the cars. We saw just about every combination of car setup. We even saw two seater cars that looked like they were from the 1930's. ""Well, looks like we gotta hike it"" I sighed. It got pretty warm walking along the road with the valley catching the humidity. The forecast said something like 97 degrees for Marblemount. A ways into our walk I noticed my feet already hurting. ""This can't be good"" I thought to myself. Eric had the same issue. A row of cars come by, surely one of them would give us a ride - right? Nope. One of the drivers looked just like Gimpilator. Imagine seeing someone who looked just like one of your best friends driving by. Giving you a death stare and then ignoring you. It was as if it was in slow motion, like a movie. ""You've got to be kidding me!"" Eric would say in anger. I couldn't blame him one bit. Before starting up I saw that my chocolate donuts were melted. At least they are still tasty as ever. Walking up the Cascade Valley Eric with Dorado Needle Flowers along the Way Contrasting Moss on the Side of the Road After hiking for about 10 miles we see a car coming. We had long since believed we would have to walk the full 19 miles of the road, but a shred of hope still remained. This time we were in luck. Both of us were ecstatic! I've seen time and time again the people you wouldn't think who would give you a ride do. Old married folks, a mom with her kids with a almost full car, and solo people. In society we often hear little phrases like ""things will just work out"" or there is always someone to help"". That's not always true. There are those who ""slip between the cracks"". It happens all the time, but few seems to care. Fortunately I was lucky in this case. Arriving at the trailhead we thank Don and his wife for the ride. It was now possible to make it on schedule to get back by Sunday. But even with the lift it wasn't going to be easy. The trail up to Cascade Pass was in great condition and was mostly snow free. Near the end I had to be careful considering that I was in tennis shoes. Hiking up to Cascade Pass (Taken by Eric) The Triad At the pass we took a long break enjoying the views around us. It was time to put on the plastic boots for almost the rest of the trip (well except for when I'm in camp). Considering that I knew the way I led the way around the edge of Mixup Peak. You could see the trail every now and then, but it was mostly snow covered. Near the Cache glacier was a perfect camping spot on a snow field. Eric and I dug out a platform and set up the tent. During sunset I went to a near by waterfall to fetch water for cooking and drinking. It felt good to be in my favorite region of the world. Brooker Mountain Heading up the Slope Mount Torment and Forbidden Snow Slope to Camp Eric Traversing the Slope with Eldorado Peak Our Camp with Magic Mountain Mount Buckner's South Face Sahale Mountain with Green Colors Alpenglow on Magic Mountain (Eric) Filling up Water on Mixup Peak (Eric) Eldorado Peak during Sunset Evening from Camp Day 3: Beginning the TraverseThe next morning after putting away the tent we walked down to the Cache Glacier. We roped up and set up butterfly knots to create rope drag in case anything happened. After crossing the Cache Glacier we had a small scramble section before arriving at the Cache Col. From there we descended down to Kool Aid Lake. Heading up the Cache Col Mount Formidable and Spider Mountain At the lake we took in the views, pulled out my Kool Aid, took some photos, and started back up again. Eric noticed clouds coming in. At first I didn't think much of them, figured they were just passing clouds. I wasn't 100% sure where the red ledge was, but figured the ledge that had a red color had to be the one. Mount Formidable Reflection from Kool Aid Lake Photographing Mount Formidable (Eric) The Red Ledge Oh Yeah! Kool Aid Lake with Kool Aid Where We Came From (Eric) Johannesburg with Kool Aid Lake Thumbs Up (Eric) As we came closer I saw what appeared to be ski tracks. Always a lovely sight. As we get near the red ledge, the slope steepens and our pace slows down. I start making bucket steps for both Eric and for my own comfort. Had I not had plastic boots it would have been very difficult to make the steps. About 20 feet before getting on the ledges was the hardest part. With a small amount of being nervous I make every step solid and with each ice axe plunge. Below was a cliff. In normal conditions one could simply walk right onto the ledge, but the icy snow made it a bit more tedious. Once we arrived on solid ground the ledge crossing was a lot friendlier. At the second snowfield the exposure was greater, but was a lot easier to work the steps. Eric on the Red Ledge Crossing the Second Snowfield Myself Heading for the Moat (Eric) Descending Down to Middle Cascade Glacier (Eric) Eric didn't like the look of the ending snowfield. So I decided to climb it, see what was ahead, and then down climb a moat. I dropped off my pack so that I could port both of our packs up though the moat (there was a rock step). With a little careful scrambling Eric was at the top of the moat. I was pleased that getting to the Middle Cascade Glacier would not be difficult nor dangerous. After having a lunch break we made our way down and around a cliff edge. With a bit more snow travel we arrive at the Middle Cascade Glacier. Clouds were now hitting Mount Formidable and weather was becoming a concern. Mount Formidable from the North Sahale and Boston Peak Johannesburg with Eldorado Peak Excited to be Here (Eric) Eric with the Middle Cascade Valley In a little over an hour we crossed the glacier and arrive at the Formidable Spider Col. I was in awe as we walked towards the edge. It was like a fortress of mountains covered in glaciers. What a joy it was to see this. Looking down below my smile quickly faded. We were surrounded by sketchy terrain. From cliffs to sketchy slopes the route down looked questionable at best. ""Maybe we arrived at the wrong col"" I announce to Eric. After looking at the map, we were indeed at the right col. A few moments earlier we passed a small col that appeared to drop off the earth. The Rest of the Ptarmigan Traverse Need I Say More? Looking into Wonderland The Gloomy Castle of Spire Point The Fortress Wall of Mountains ""Let's at least give it a look"" I yell back in hopes that it goes. ""I don't like the look of it"" Eric replies. In mountaineering when your out of options you have to try out the ones you don't think are going to fly. It wasn't that I was taking a blind leap into the unknown, but putting out a leap of faith into what may be the only way. I finally got Eric to agree to allow me to explore it so long as we placed in snow pickets. The snow took us down further. Eric was still not convinced that it went. ""Let me check just a little further"" I said with a smile. After heading down a hundred or so feet I could slowly see the route would indeed go. I was so pleased to see this. Heading down the Formidable Col Old Guard and Sentinel Peak As we head down the snow, the clouds drift over the mountains making a white out a serious possibility. Each step became painful as the padding of my boots pressed against my blistered skin. Making it to Yang Yang lakes that night was cast out of the possibilities. We were tired and the weather was not going to hold for long. We found a nice flat spot on the snowfield near some large boulders. At camp we had dinner, Eric helped pad my blisters, and watched the sky go away. Eric sat out on the rocks reading one of his two books. As it got dark the clouds followed and all that was left was a misty view. As the Clouds Drop Excited Eric Cloudy Peak in the Distance Mountains Clouding Over Agnes Mountain North Face Storm over Le Conte Le Conte Glacier Pathway Bad Weather Arrives (Eric) The Route to Yang Yang Lakes Our Camp on Mount Formidable Day 4: Miles of Fog and GlaciersConsidering the nasty weather outside we slept in. ""What do you want to do Josh"" Eric announced. ""Proceed"" I replied"". ""But there is almost no visibility"" he said. ""I have pictures from the previous day showing the way"" I reply. With some observations Eric decides to give it a try. Mount Formidable Clearing Standing at the Edge of Cloudiness Considering the steep snow slopes to get to Yang Yang lakes, we decided to take the lower route. This is where my years of navigation though storms paid off quite well. We did a combination of descending and ascending through snow slopes and shrubby areas. At one point I wasn't quite sure which way was the right path. Pulling out the camera I see a ""C"" shaped snowfield right near by me. Using photographs and piecing together the evidence I figured out exactly where we were. With a bit of descending we arrived at Yang Yang lakes. We were both pretty pleased. For what ever reason the weather at the lakes was a bit better and allowed for minor openings in the clouds. But not enough to get much information on how exactly to go about our route. Pointing Out the Way (Eric) Yang Yang Lakes View After having lunch at the lake I decided that following the trail was the best option. I'm not always into conformity but in this case it looked as if any other options could lead us onto places that are less than ideal. The trail faded off into a snowfield leading us up to the proper gully. As we enter the gully Eric announces that he does not feel comfortable with the idea of heading up into bad weather when neither of us know exactly where the route goes. ""No worries Eric, I'm glad that you were willing to give it a try"" I reply with a smile. For myself, the attempt was not in vain. We went back to south Yang Yang lake. ""Our level of risk taking is quite different"" Eric said. ""I know"". ""So your okay with going into a white out with howling winds, possibly stormy weather, and not exactly sure where you are going"" Eric replied. ""Yeah"" I whisper back. While bad weather was a possibility, it was not a certainty. Bailing on the Ptarmigan Traverse isn't such an easy task. It's a committing route. Eric and I were very aware of this fact. I told Eric that I was more than willing to bail, but that I believed that we could proceed safely. Eric examined his map figuring out our escape options and how far we still had to go. There was only one reasonable escape option which involved hiking down a potentially very bad bushwhack valley (Flat Creek) and then hiking up the Stehekin river all the way up to Cascade Pass. Then it would involve another round of possible hitch hike difficulties plus a 12 mile bike ride. View from South Yang Yang Lake We had much debating of our options and thought it over for a long time. Eric finally came to a conclusion. ""I don't think this is a good idea, but I'll go for it"" Eric announces. With quick time we hike back over from the lake to the bottom of the gully. The rest of the gully was not as bad as it looked. At the top of the gully we started descending the nearly flat ridge toward Le Conte Mountain. Eventually I found the trail! We were both ecstatic. After a while the trail faded into snow. Seeing a cornice near by was a good sign of us being on route. Making the Best of It As I traveled along the snowfield it appeared to steepen with cliffs below. ""I'm not liking the looks of this"" Eric said. He suggested the snowfield that was above. I didn't like the idea at first considering that it conflicted with evidence that I had, but I undermined the distance of a photograph. Nearing the top I take a look at my photos again and was pleased to announce that we were on route. From here the snow gently traversed along the edge of Le Conte Mountain. As I traversed the snow, I found the ski tracks again. ""Well I'll be darned"" Eric said with excitement. It was a neat time frame to see the Le Conte Glacier hanging over cliffs with a beautiful blue lake below and to be heading into a white out. Using Pictures to Figure Out the Way (Eric) Myself with Le Conte Lake (Eric) Le Conte Glacier though the Clouds Following the Ski Tracks Looking down on Le Conte Lake Flat Creek Valley Near the edge of the glacier we found a rock spot to rope up. There was just enough room for the two of us to carefully get our gear together. It was a little bit tedious. Any wrong move and it could sent my backpack, ice axe, or other equipment flying down the cliffs below that go into a glacier. When we were all set I decided it was best to have my camera away. Eric fortunately took a few picture on the next part of the trip. As we walk onto the glacier, the views disappear and we are back into a whiteout. The Cliffs Above Crevasses on the Le Conte Glacier The glacier was in mostly good shape with a few crevasses to walk around. ""Eric look, a arch shaped crevasse!"" I yell. ""I don't even want to look"" Eric replies as he watches each step carefully. It had multiple layers to it. It almost had the appearance of an arch from arches national park. As the slope flattens out I start heading to the glaciers edge in hopes for it being our exit. As I look above I see nothing but dark gloomy cliffs. The place was anything but inviting. I decided that if this wasn't the way, either I passed it or had to try going higher. I decided it was best to try up before going back. Fortunately going up was the right call. As we arrive at the second flat section I head back to the glaciers edge. ""This is the gap"" I yell in excitement"". I show Eric the man made rock camp site. Eric was thrilled about this. At the very least we had a bail spot. But to maximize our time we decided to keep going. While traversing the edge of Sentinel Peak I had no more photographs to help give any evidence of where we were going. Fortunately I found the ski tracks which we followed for as long as possible. Eventually they led us to a series of cliffs. Through the fog we could see the glacier down below, it looked so massive. Perhaps one of the biggest in the state. With a little bit of looking around I found a ramp down onto the glacier. South Cascade Glacier Below (Eric) Is this Going to Go? Exploring the Cliff Edge (Eric) Taking the Ramp onto the Glacier (Eric) We passed by a man made over sight. To my surprise the glacier did not have many crevasses. Yeah, there would be a baby one here and there, but no big deal. As time goes by I'm in a constant slog walk going up. Not entirely sure where to exit. We were lucky to have had a break in the clouds to see our exit. But the way it happened made it still some what of a mystery. ""Josh, you need to head right"" Eric would yell. I'd walk a bit right, but then eventually go back in the habit of following the curved glacier streaks. Perhaps it was because I was so tired. Eric told me again later, so I had us go diagonal to what we had been going. The slope steeped and eventually required a traverse. After crossing the snow we arrived on rock. After doing a bit more exploring I saw what appeared to be a saddle. Excitement roars as I tell Eric ""I think this is it!"". Heading down onto it I quickly discover that it was a cornice. The sky was getting dark rapidly. I could see white rock lakes down below. I explained the situation to Eric. He was not pleased. Not only would we have to belay each other off the cornice but we were not even sure if the slope safely went. ""Josh, we don't know if this goes"" Eric yelled. ""We are running out of time and we don't have a lot of options"" I yelled back to Eric. There were only two passes that we saw. One was a high pass and the other was a low one. We were on the low one. Logically this made sense for this one to be the one, especially with what I remembered from looking at maps. But I could not confirm it. Eric seemed quite worried about this. I was a little bit as well. ""We have to at least give it a try, waiting here won't solve anything"" I said. Eric agreed. I set up the anchor while Eric took care of the rope. Eric decided to go first, I got the belay ready, and he was on. As I was belaying Eric off the cornice I saw one of the coolest things I've ever seen. Glacier Peak popped out of the clouds with full on alpenglow color. It dwarfed Dome Peak which looked huge in itself. Seeing it all in one setting was beyond words. It was for my eyes only. I couldn't take a picture because I was kinda sorta belaying my partner off a cornice. And it's kinda a big deal for me to make sure that goes well. By the time he was down the colors were gone. It was time for me to head down. Face in the slope, place axe in well, and kick in the snow. At the bottom we followed the bottom of the cornice to the other side where it seemed safer. Still racing the clock I quickly plunge step down the snowfield to make sure it goes. Once Eric arrived I did the final traverse and could happily announce ""it goes"". The rest of the way down was a snow walk to the lake. After looking around for a little bit we found a flat spot a set up camp. ""That was the most absurd day of my life"" Eric exclaimed. Heading Down to White Rock Lakes (Eric) So Excited for Dinner (Eric) I walked down to West Agnes creek to fill up water for cooking and drinking. The view was so beautiful I decided to return for a night shot. After some tasty cheese pasta and good food I slept great that night. Dome, Sinister, and Gunsight during Evening Dome Peak during Evening Day 5: Bushwhack CityOnce again we slept in a bit due to how tiring the previous day was. Eric helped bandage me up due to my blisters being even worse. ""Josh, I know how you like your adventure. So how would you like to solo the rest of the way and I'll head down the Downey drainage?"". It was indeed a tempting offer. I could avoid serious buchwhacking if I did this route. However there were some serious red flags that were raised. The gap over Spire Point had a cornice. There were some crevasses over the glacier. The Downey creek drainage had some steep contours. If either of us got injured, it would very very serious. With all these red flags I decided against the idea. ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm going to have to decline"" I said after a while of thinking it over. I've seen a lot of trouble in my time from splitting up. After having a bowl of cereal we packed up camp. Creek View of Dome Peak Spire Point's Northeast Face Looking over the Maps (Eric) Sinister Peak's Northwest Face The Pass we Came From Agnes Mountain's West Face Heading up to the Pass White Rock Lakes View Gunsight Peak Yours Truly with Dome (Eric) Spire on Spire Point Old Guard Peak's Summit Crevasses on the Chickamin We passed by Agnes creek and filled up our water. I was going to miss this place, but at least I plan on being back. We hiked up to a pass above White Rock lakes just north of the German Helmet. We took a break and then proceeded down the last valley. Going down the snow wasn't bad at all. Heading over the Last Pass Mount Buckindy East Face Hoch Joch Spitz South Face Eric with the German Helmet Pond Reflection The German Helmet East Face Eventually we start getting back into the woods. This is where things got interesting again. As we went down the route appeared to drop off a cliff. I decided to traverse slightly upward towards the German Helmet. To my luck I found a 5 slinged rappel station. It looked like the only reasonable way down. The rope would not reach with a traditional rappel. Fortunately Eric knew how to setup a pull cord. After a while of setup Eric carefully rappelled down and so did I. As I went down I made sure there was no tangles on the tree. At the bottom I pulled the rope and it came off cleanly. This was the beginning of what became one of the worst bushwhacks I've ever had. Rappelling Down from the Woods Waterfall Below the German Helmet Finishing up the Rappel (Eric) Near by Waterfall (Eric) The bushwhack started out moderate. The slope was steep enough to knock rocks down and require many veggie belays. As we went down further there were snow patches that went over a small creek. At times you had to hope you wouldn't fall in. Sometimes you did anyways. There were so many bugs in a few spots. At one point I was constantly picking them off of me and holding my breath. It didn't help that it was humid, hot, and I was covered in sweat. For a short period of time we escaped the bushwhack and onto boulders. I could finally take off my plastic boots and gear down to tennis shoes. But before doing that I had to inspect my feet. They felt terrible! The band aids and bandages were old, leaving me no choice but to take them off. It wasn't pleasant. Eric pulled out his first aid kit while I washed my feet off. Eric used a ciringe to pressure wash the wounds on my legs. He took good care of me which was deeply appreciated. After everything was all set we started hiking down the boulders. Every step was painful by this point. Every now and then I would almost sprain my ankle. Eric saw this and was concerned. So was I. Each step had to be made with caution. But due to my fragile state my carefulness wouldn't hold up forever. At one point I lightly rolled my ankle. Fortunately it wasn't bad so I was still able to proceed with a fair pace. Heading Down into the Bushes My Feet Before they Got Worse Veggie Belaying Down (Eric) Happy to have Washed my Feet (Eric) As the slope eases the creek bed nearly ended and the bushes took over. This is when things got ugly fast. Following the creek would never word, so we decided that heading into the woods was the best option. The edges between the woods and the creek were the worst spots making it a annoying zone to cross. The woods at least provided some relief, although they weren't that good either. It slowly got worse and we ended up seeing fields of devils club. Fallen over trees were either our best friend or at other times our enemy. Some trees would ""explode"" as you walked on them, but it is worth the risk considering how much time they saved. There was no where good to camp. In fact there was no where bad to camp, it was all terrible. After hours of bushwhacking we see another major creek drainage. ""I think this is Bachelor creek"" Eric said with a happy tone. ""Sorry to bring the bad news, but this is not Bachelor creek. Above is the Spire Glacier"" I replied. We were both disappointed by this fact. This meant we had hours to go before arriving at camp. Friendlier Bush Whacking Spire Point from the Northwest Messzilla Going from One Tree to Another The forest became more and more epic as we went along. Jump here, climb over that tree, get scrapped up by devils club, cross this creek, head up hill a ways, go back down. Soak soak, my feet just got soaked. I'm sure that will help add to the blister situation. It wasn't like this happened every now and then, it was constant. I was constantly out of breath, constantly sweating down my face, getting new scrapes, hurting my feet, getting more exhausted, running out of time, becoming more fatigued, head ache starting up, jump, jog, walk across the log. Suddenly it collapses and I hit my shin super hard on a hidden log sticking out. ""Awwwwwwww ha ha!"" I yell in pain. Almost like being stabbed, oh wait I kinda was. I saw blood coming out my sock. This was the worst battle scar from the trip. Crossing a Creek Looking above I saw the ridge going down. But it had been going down all along. Or so that's what it looked like. ""When will it end?"" I laughed with hysteria. With each motion, each push, and every breath I knew that if I give in just a little bit I would be forced to sleep out in these terrible woods with no tent and getting bit up all night. After many more hours of bush whacking the woods finally curve, we rise up in elevation, and I knew we were close. The woods were getting dark but we arrived just in time to the Downey creek trail. ""YESSSSSS!"" I exclaim in a joyous moment. We soon arrive to a flat area where camp was set up. I filled up water and sat down. I had spent almost everything I had to come this far. I was so fatigued I couldn't help Eric setup the tent. Well I could have, but by the time I would clip in a item or two he would have done at least 10 times more work than me. I just lied down under all my weakness. After some well deserved food and water we went to sleep. I Don't Feel Like Getting Up (Eric) Are We Done Yet? Day 6: Leaving the MountainsEric bandaged what he could of my feet. ""Those are the worst looking feet I have ever seen"" Eric exclaimed. ""This is the worst my feet have ever felt"" I replied. I wasn't quite sure how well my feet would hold up that day, but I wasn't about to give up now. The start of the trail was decent until we crossed the Downey creek bridge. Back Into the Bushwhack The trail was in terrible shape. ""What is this?!"" I yelled as I saw dozens of fallen over trees and devils club on the trail. There's no easy way out. I smiled knowing that's how it usually goes down. But I didn't come here for easy adventure. The devils club even grew over parts of the bridges which was a huge surprise to me. Last year when I climbed Dome Peak the trail was in great shape. Now it was one of the worst looking trails I've ever seen. After many more miles of bad trailness we arrive at the Suiattle river road. What is This? The rest of the walk home was just enduring miles of road walking while being quite tired. Eric made me remember a poem as we walked which to my surprise I remembered. We had many other fun conversations during this trip. When we arrived near the trailhead I said ""the mind see's what it wants to see"" as I thought I imagined seeing the gate. Sure enough I saw it again. ""I wasn't imagining it"" I yell happily. I instantly bit my tongue. At the car I was so happy to take off my pack, shoes, and socks. Paranoid of Hornets (Eric) Happy to be Back! (Eric) After the trip I went to see a doctor for my feet. They gave me over 10 days of antibiotics to prevent my legs from getting infected. My legs on some days would be so swollen that I would almost skip college, but I knew that would defeat the purpose of rushing on this trip. So I went anyways. It wasn't until 11 days later that I could comfortably run again. This was an experience I will never forget. Images View Booyah!

Josh Lewis - Jul 24, 2013 4:49 am - Hasn't voted Re: interesting trip I wanted to go over the Spire col. But Eric was tired of climbing over mountain passes and wanted to get out of the mountains as soon as possible. I knew that going solo the standard way would be way to hazardous for both of us. Eric wouldn't have had a rope for the rappel, I could have had to travel on glacier unroped and go over a cornice. We could have tried to figure something out or go for the Dana Col but again, he felt that he had enough. I can't say I blame him. The bushwhack down Bachelor was friendly, almost non existent. I wish it was like that going down. But we made the best of it and got a good adventure out of it. awilsondc - Jul 23, 2013 11:15 pm - Voted 10/10 Dang!

Bushwhacking in the Cascades is possibly the hardest thing to do in that range (or anywhere). It makes glacier travel seem easy and straighforward! My buddy and I also wanted to bail at White Rock Lakes, and we decided to go down West Agnes Creek and try and hook up with the PCT, which was a terrible idea. We got trapped by raging glacial melt creeks and slide alder and had to be helicoptered out. Dana glacier and Spire col look so steep from White Rock Lakes, especially after being so tired and mentally exhausted. Every time I think about that trip, I think, ""we should've taken a rest day,"" and just gone over the Dana Glacier. Looking back at photos and maps, it's no steeper than the stuff we had already gone over, like that steep descent from Spider-Formidable col and the descent to White Rock Lakes. And even going up LeConte glacier. Anyway, that helicopter ride is the low point of my mountaineering career, but calling for help did seem to be the right decision. The guys who rescued us told us that if we hadn't gotten trapped, it would've taken a week to navigate all the deadfall and brush to get back to the PCT. Apparently the trail shown on the map up West Agnes Creek from the PCT hasn't existed for years. Lesson learned. No bushwhacking in the Cascades, especially going DOWN unknown terrain!

single-day,"Climbing Mount Rainier in less than a day... from sea level
The following trip report is a detailed record of the three years leading up to a climb of Mount Rainier by a couple of old high school buddies from Montana (Matt and Braden). The account of our climb in late July of 2012 doesn't start until about halfway down if you wish to skip ahead. Prologue As best as I can remember, the first discussions of this trip were during a climb up Black Mtn (MT) in 2009. Pictured is Matt climbing the Y couloir. While mountaineering in Montana in the summer of 2009, my friend Matt (elchivoloco) proposed an interesting idea for a trip: What if we climbed Mt Rainier, but instead of starting at a usual trailhead (Paradise, Sunrise, etc.), we started at sea level on the Puget Sound and only used human power to attain the summit. This would involve road biking from sea level, then climbing to the summit for a two part adventure that we would later call Sea 2 Summit (S2S). Matt had previously worked in the Tacoma area and apparently this giant mountain had been inspiring him to push the limits of cycling and climbing. I was skeptical but offered to support him by participating in the climbing portion of the trek. I'd been interested in climbing Rainier for almost a decade, but I was living in Montana and never had an easy opportunity to schedule a climb. Conversely, while I owned a road bike, I'd never taken it on a ride any longer than 15 miles, so the thought of biking 75+ miles from sea level to over a mile up just wasn't that appealing. He seemed to accept that answer at the time as he had local biking friends in the Tacoma area that might be interested in joining just the bike ride portion. Hard training on a bike was new to me - such as this ride on the Going-to-the-Sun Hwy early one spring. But by January 2010 (after a few more climbing and skiing trips with Matt), I was fully engrossed in the idea of completing the entire trek. Matt's original idea was just to complete the S2S bike/climb in one day (24 hours), as that would be a feat in and of itself. After researching the idea myself, I started to wonder just how fast one could travel from the sea to the summit of Mount Rainier, using only human power (this was the only other record I could find in my internet meanderings - but this trip has been brought to my attention since posting this trip report). So I offered a counter-proposal: I'd join in for the whole S2S trek, but with the goal of pushing ourselves to complete the journey in the fastest time we could muster. This seemed to be in the neighborhood of 12-14 hours, based on some rough calculations. The idea of competing against the clock was not foreign, as we'd both ran cross country and track in high school and participated in numerous other timed events. That history may have made the idea all the more appealing. Unfortunately, an attempt of the S2S in 2010 wasn't possible as I was working on data collection and analysis for my Master's thesis that summer. Stretching my knee on an easy ski tour at the start of my recovery in the spring of 2011. In the fall of 2010, we started discussing potential trip schedules and training regimens for an attempt of the S2S in June 2011. We decided that the route we would attempt on Rainier would be the straightforward Disappointment Cleaver, with a direct ride from the Puget Sound starting in Steilacoom and ending at Paradise. But before we got very far, I injured my knee on a skiing trip in December 2010. After numerous doctor's visits and physical therapy over many months, I was on the path to recovery by late March 2011. But this did not leave me enough time to adequately train for the strenuous demands of the S2S, even at an easy pace. I had kept Matt in the loop with regards to my injury, but in mid-April we decided to call off the trip for 2011. It was a difficult, but necessary decision. Flash forward to 2012. Matt and I started training in late winter for a 2012 attempt at the S2S, building on a base of backcountry skiing over the winter (Matt had been in Colorado for a few years now and I was still in Montana). We'd actually pushed back our attempt from June 2012 to July in order to complete more training on real roads and mountains (vs. a gym), which ended up being quite fortuitous as the weather in June ended up being miserable and wet on Rainier. [The only downside was that my wife would be 34 weeks pregnant with our first in late July...] Our training consisted of road biking, mountain biking, trail running, and mountaineering. Over the next few months (April-July), we both put in hundreds of hours training and by the middle of July, were both well prepared for the S2S attempt that was only a week away. Our route from sea to summit, looking NW from Rainier to the Puget Sound.    Imagery source: Google Earth Final Prep and Dry Run The Crew: Braden (me), Andy, and Matt, left to right Matt arrived in Montana on July 23. He brought a friend along (Andy) who was going to help us out by joining our dry run climb and shuttling a vehicle/setting up a basecamp at Camp Muir during our S2S attempt. We spent the next day riding a local mountain bike trail, organizing our gear, and reviewing glacier rescue techniques. After paring down our gear to the basic necessities, we crammed our gear into Matt's Impreza. The next day we drove to White Pass in Washington and on the morning of July 26, we were in Paradise. We'd decided long ago that we wanted to complete a dry run of the Disappointment Cleaver route prior to the S2S. There were many advantages to this, including getting first-person beta of the route (which I had never climbed but Matt had), figuring out our climbing pace and clothing systems, and getting some time on the rope together (we didn't have the opportunity to climb together at all during our training in 2012). The primary disadvantage was that it would tire us out, even with a few days rest. So over July 26 and 27, Matt, Andy, and I ascended to Camp Muir, rested for 11 hours, and then completed the climb to the summit of Rainier in the wee hours of the morning. The dry run turned out to be invaluable, as we learned just how difficult it was to pass other rope teams on the DC, especially the larger and generally slower guided groups. We had originally planned to summit around 4-6 am during our S2S attempt, but we realized that there was no way we would be able to maintain a good pace if we kept running into other groups of climbers. Our goal for a summit time would have to be earlier to avoid the crowds, as would our start time at Steilacoom. The original plan was to start the bike at 4 pm, but we decided 2 pm would be more favorable and would hopefully keep us in front of other groups summitting that morning. Shots from our dry run: our first view of Mount Rainier, taking a break just below the Muir snowfield, Andy, Matt and I enjoying the summit, and descending a snowy section of the DC. After finishing the dry run, we scouted the bike route along the Mountain Highway back to the coast. There were two substantial hitches along our intended bike route. One was the closure of a few miles of Hwy 7, which we had known about since June. The detour through Eatonville ended up adding 1.5 miles to our route, as well as additional elevation changes. It seemed there was no option but to take the detour, despite the more narrow and winding roads it followed. The second hitch was that the roads we intended to use south of Tacoma were far too dangerous for cycling, with fast traffic and non-existent shoulders in places. Thankfully, we had a couple of rest days to find a suitable, safe route and were successful in re-routing that part of the bike. Mike and Andy, our support crew, on their way to Camp Muir. While resting between the dry run and S2S, we visited two friends in the Seattle/Tacoma area. Our second host (Mike) decided to join Andy in supporting our S2S adventure at Camp Muir. Both decided they would haul their skis up to Camp Muir and ski down the morning after our climb. Mike's place in Tacoma served as our base of operations and we organized our gear on his front lawn and ran through our crevasse rescue techniques again before heading out for dinner and a beer at a local pub. The Sea 2 Summit Attempt The car packed with a small mountain of gear, ready for our S2S adventure. I woke up the morning of July 29 earlier than I expected at 7:30 am. Matt was awake as well. We'd hoped to sleep in until 10 am or so, as we weren't starting until 2 pm and would be climbing through the night. But both Matt and I were too excited to keep sleeping, so we got up and made a few last minute preparations to our bikes and packs. Something was bothering me, however. I'd had an itch in the back of my throat the previous evening that had gotten worse through the night and now my lymph nodes were swollen. I decided to play it by ear and see how I felt closer to noon, but let Matt know that I wasn't feeling all that great. A little after noon, Matt and I sat down to discuss our options. He wasn't feeling 100% either but wanted to get going rather than wait a few days to see if our health improved. I really wanted to be at 100%, not 90%, as we'd put in so much effort into training for this attempt and I wanted there to be a high chance of success. In the end we decided to go for it, with the explicit understanding that if either of us felt we absolutely needed to stop, the other would comply. Around 1:40pm we arrived at the ferry terminal in Steilacoom, WA. The temperature was around 70°F, the sun was poking between clouds, and you could smell the salt in the air. We did a last minute lube of the bike chains before heading to the water. There's a public boat ramp next to the ferry and we were able to start with our rear wheels touching the water. It was thrilling to get going after years of prep. This was it. At 2 pm on the dot, we set off for Rainier. Mike and Andy took off for the mountain as well to grab their permit to camp at Muir and turn in our climbing permit. Final prep at the Steilacoom Ferry - wheels in the water and off we go! Matt set a quick pace as we snaked through south Tacoma, progressing from Steilacoom to Lake City to Parkland and then Spanaway. The roads we had chosen were fairly wide and only had minimal traffic on a Sunday afternoon. The traffic lights seemed to be turning in our favor and we only put our feet down at a half dozen or so times as we sped through town. Things were looking good, although the pace was a bit quicker than I expected. The scratchiness in my throat appeared to subside in the first few miles of the ride, but that could've just been due to the adrenaline. I meant to take photos during the ride but kept forgetting to get my camera out. By the time we passed the junction to Hwy 507, we were in a nice groove. Matt would pull for a few miles, then I'd take over and lead the next few miles while he drafted. We cycled like that all the way to Eatonville, snacking occasionally and hydrating heavily. It wasn't ridiculously hot, but far from cool. We rolled through Eatonville at 1 hr 48 min into the ride. The uphill south of town on the detour was a little steep, but manageable. A few minutes after cresting the hill we had our only close call with traffic: a truck blew by us with less than a foot to spare and nearly knocked us off the shoulder. Otherwise, the cars passing us were giving us wide berth and even slowing down when traffic was thicker. The detour was certainly the most dangerous section of the ride and I was relieved to be past it and back on Hwy 7 before too long. A quick shot of my watch at the Park entrance. Matt and I passed by the towns of Elbe and Ashford, still rotating the lead (although Matt's pulls were longer), and arrived at the Rainier Park entrance at 5:15 pm. We filled up on water thanks to a ranger who had just come off duty as there weren't any publicly accessible water spigots. Our arrival was a bit earlier than I expected, but we'd kept a fast pace over the first 60 miles. I took a photo of my watch to record the time and we set off a few minutes later after downing a couple of snacks (gels, bars, etc.). Matt took the lead up the road and the grade of the road started to increase. I wasn't able to keep up the pace we'd had before, but Matt seemed fine to stick with me for a slower climb, despite this being his strength. As the road steepened, my calves were straining to even maintain a moderate speed and I slowed further as my legs grew weaker. As we passed Longmire and Cougar Rock, I could feel my legs starting to cramp up and had serious doubts about even making it to Paradise. I started thinking we'd gone way to fast at the beginning of the ride, and that there was no way I was even going to make it to Camp Muir without a serious second wind. Matt kept providing encouragement, but eventually I had to stop. We rested for a good 11 minutes as I tried to find the strength to power on for another 2100 vertical feet to Paradise. I just didn't know if I had it in me. Failure seemed imminent and I had basically lost all mental focus. I don't remember how, but a few words from Matt brought me back just far enough to keep going, away from that dark pool of self-doubt, anger, and disappointment. I was f%#&ing frustrated, but got back on the saddle and kept pushing, one pedal stroke after another, plodding up the hill at what seemed to be a snail's pace. Thankfully, the uphill traffic was basically non-existent in the park that evening, so at least I didn't have to focus too much on keeping my bike on the shoulder. Another shot of my watch at the Paradise, about halfway through our 25 minute break. A mile or so shy of Paradise, I insisted that Matt forge ahead and find the car in the overnight lot. He sped off up the hill and out of sight. I couldn't remember how much further it was at that point and figured another few switchbacks were ahead. But almost out of nowhere, I rounded the last bend and saw that Andy and Mike had left the car almost next to the road in a great location. Matt had already pulled our packs out of the back and was scarfing down some food. The time was 7:06 pm and it hadn't even been 2 hours since we'd entered the park. I gingerly hopped off the saddle and stashed my bike on top of the car. It felt good to get off the bike. It felt even better to eat some real food and change out of our sweaty bike clothes. Still, I was extremely concerned about my energy levels and needed to get on the trail to see if I should call off this attempt for the summit. I left the lot 5 minutes ahead of Matt at 7:32 pm and started climbing the asphalt trails above the lodge. As we'd sat down to eat at the car, a fog had rolled in and it was now extremely thick. The maze of trails above Paradise was easier to navigate due to our wanderings on them days earlier, but I was still worried that one of us might take a wrong turn. Everything seemed familiar, though, and my energy levels seemed to be picking up. The muscles I was using now didn't seem to be as ragged as when I was on the bike. Around 6500 ft, the fog broke and my spirits lifted as I looked up toward Rainier. I passed a few climbers coming down the trails and had them relay a message to Matt that I was still ahead of him and would meet him at the Muir snowfield. My legs were feeling stronger and being able to use trekking poles really helped out. A beautiful sunset from just below the Muir snowfield. Matt on the Muir snowfield I crossed Pebble Creek at McClure Rock and washed my face in the crisp water as I waited for Matt. He rounded the bend minutes later and we rested a few more minutes before starting up the snowfield. The snow conditions were actually quite favorable – just hard enough to keep from sloshing around but soft enough not to need crampons. The climb up to Muir seemed to race by and before we knew it, the Muir huts were visible. I raced ahead to find Mike and Andy and arrived at Camp Muir just after 10 pm. The original plan was to have Andy and Mike prep a hot meal and melt some water for us at Muir. Sadly, they had only arrived 30 minutes ahead of us and were just starting up the stove. We set to work getting the meal ready and melting additional water for our summit push. Andy dug around in his pack for a few pieces of climbing gear we'd pawned off on him. I took a visit to the lovely outhouses at Muir and was lucky enough to talk to a couple of climbers who had a spare liter of water to give us. It probably saved us 15 minutes of melting water. We ate, drank, geared up, and set off from Muir just over an hour later. There had been one headlamp crossing the Cowlitz Glacier during our break, but it looked as though we'd beat the rest of the groups out of Muir. Matt took the lead of our two-man rope team and we charged off into the dark just after 11 pm. Matt and I double check our gear before leaving Camp Muir for the summit As we crested the Cathedral Gap, there was still only one light on the route ahead and a bit of activity at the Ingraham Flats camp. We'd left our crampons off for the rocky climb up the gap, so we secured our crampons and set off to get ahead of the groups at the camp. The route across the Ingraham Glacier had become more circuitous in the few days since the dry run as more crevasses had opened. We almost thought we'd gone too high before traversing and dropping back to the base of the Disappointment Cleaver. Luckily, Matt was able to stay on route and we made it to the cleaver without getting lost. The cleaver was a slog, as it had been on the dry run. I hate wearing crampons on rock/sand. We'd discussed removing them a few days prior but decided it would be too much trouble. I watched Matt's crampons spark on the rocks and we started up a conversation as I'd shortened our rope for the cleaver. The conversation actually helped as it distracted me from my increasingly tired legs and a slight headache that had settled in. By the top of the cleaver we really started to slow down. We'd been going strong for over 11 hours and the elevation and cumulative effects of hours of hard activity were starting to show. The headlamp ahead of us on the glacier was encouraging, though, and we pushed on to the switchbacks awaiting us in the dark. Energy was waning fast as we hit 13,000 ft. We could climb for 2-3 minutes but then had to rest for 15-30 seconds. The wind started to pick up and the temperature was now below freezing. Matt and I yelled back and forth, making sure both of us were still warm enough in our minimal clothing. Neither of us really wanted to stop to put on another layer unless we had to. We finally caught up with and passed the solo climber around 13,500 ft. He watched us cross a snowbridge and I offered a belay, but he declined. At this point, we knew we were getting close and I think we subconsciously picked up the pace. Matt told me later that the whole climb between the cleaver and the crater had been mentally taxing; this section had been much easier on the dry run when the sun had started to rise and we could more easily monitor our progress. I think we still made great time, but it did feel like forever. Looking out onto the Emmons Glacier in the twilight from the DC (taken during the descent) Exhausted elation in the middle of the night on the summit of Mount Rainier! The crater rim came into view, and I felt a surge of energy. We were so close! We topped out at 2:34 am and I wound up our rope for the trek across the crater. The last ¼ mile went by in a flash as we pressed on to the summit, though we did stop twice to catch our breath. But in almost no time, we were there. It was 2:44 am, 12 hours 44 minutes 30 seconds since our start at sea level! I let out a hoot and we snapped a quick photo in the dark. Matt waited patiently in the biting wind as I sent a SPOT message to my wife from the summit to let her know we'd made it. I was elated and drained at the same time. We'd pulled it off! Retreating to a calm nook just below the rim, we put on a few more layers and prepped ourselves for the long trek ahead. Our goal had been reached, but we still had 9,000 ft to descend in order to call this trip a success. As we crossed paths with the solo climber in the crater, we offered our congrats and encouragement through the breezy night air. Exhaustion had truly set in as we returned to the east rim of the summit crater – just a few feet of uphill travel showed us just how tired we were. And at this point, all we wanted was a cautious and deliberately slow descent back to Camp Muir, but it would still take lots of energy, especially since we could now see the string of headlamps of the other climbers snaking up the mountain. We'd have to pass them all on one of the steeper parts of the route. We made contact with the first group about 700 ft below the crater and by the time we reached the top of the cleaver, we'd passed between 60 and 70 climbers. Thank goodness we had made it out of Muir/Ingraham camps ahead of them. At the top of Disappointment Cleaver, the solo climber caught up to us, and we chatted for a few minutes. Clif, from Vancouver, B.C., was surprised to catch us as we'd been strong heading up, but seemed to understand our cautious approach to our descent. The sun rises over the Ingraham Glacier and Little Tahoma. Matt rests for a bit as we descend the Cathedral Gap. The rest of the descent down the DC was slow and uneventful. I even had time to snap a few photos of the glowing landscape as the sun rose. We stumbled into Camp Muir at about 6:20 am and crawled into the Muir hut to get a little sleep in just our climbing attire. I was successful and awoke at 9:05 am to find Matt heading out the door. He hadn't slept much and thought he'd have better luck at the car. I stuck around for almost an hour packing and enjoying the sunshine above the clouds with Andy and Mike as they prepped for their ski down the Muir snowfield. Again, Paradise was obscured below the clouds, still hovering around 7,000 ft. By 10 am, the sun had warmed the snow sufficiently and I glissaded much of the way down the Muir snowfield. Another 50 minutes and I was standing at the car, glad that this trip had come to a close at about 11:35 am on July 30. Epilogue Matt and I celebrate the successful summit on the dry run, knowing that most of our journey is still to come. Completing the S2S was one of the hardest things I've done in my life. At the top I was gassed and felt like another step up would have been impossible. And by the end at Camp Muir I was about ready to fall on my face. I could have passed out right there on the Cowlitz Glacier or curled up in a ball on the cleaver if I'd given myself the chance in those last hours of our descent. What made it so difficult? There wasn't any single event, no crux of the climb that was especially taxing or challenging, it was purely the accumulation of activity, hours upon hours, that slowly wore us down. Matt thought the hardest part was knowing just how fast to go, as we traveled at a relatively conservative pace until the last thousand feet or so. I can agree with that and honestly thought I went too fast on the bike, putting the whole trip in jeopardy. But everything seemed to work out just right. Part of that was luck, no doubt, but much of it was years of mental, physical, and emotional preparation. All I can say is I'm glad I did the S2S. Looking back, only a few days ago now, I ask myself, “Why did I do it?” This project, this route had been on my mind for years, slowly building in intensity. For the last few months, it had been my number one priority. But where did it get me? On our S2S climb, I only spent 7 or 8 minutes on the summit of Rainier, a few moments in time. It really was the journey in this case that was important, the hundreds of hours of training, researching routes, finding the perfect equipment, and preparing mentally. It would not have been possible without all that work. But without those few moments at the very top, would I have been satisfied? I doubt it. I would have returned to try the S2S again. I may still return to do it again, to see if I can beat the clock another time. Just not for a couple years... “It was just a moment in the mountains, but enough moments add up to a life.” - Douglas Chadwick, The Wolverine Way Thanks Matt and I attempt to calm the butterflies in our guts seconds before heading for Rainier.

multi-day,"A Weekend in the Enchantments: 4 Peaks in a Row
Introduction ""Where the clouds can go, men can go; but they must be hardy men."" -A. Maurer Last year my brother Michael and Eastking went up Colchuck Peak in Late March which for over a year I been wanting to do. Last week Redwic invited me to join with Gimpilator for a Grand Slam in the Enchantments. Redwic let me stay over at his house which we sorted gear, planned out our routes, and printed off maps. Dragontail Peak from Colchuck Lake We woke up at 2 a.m. for a nice alpine start to head out to the Stuart Lake Trailhead. By the time we got to the trailhead we were all excited by this point. When getting out of the car it was so nice to feel the fresh mountain air again. For the past several weeks I had been stuck at home with tons of homework which I graduated June 9, 2011. The weather was absolutely perfect, we could not have picked a better time to head to the Enchantments. The weekend before people said it was too snowy, and then next weekend permit season was going to start up. The Edge of Enchantment Peak Going for ColchuckAt around 5:30 a.m. we started hiking up the trail to Colchuck Lake which was nice and easy even with a heavy pack. Later up the trail we encountered snow which was mostly solid, views of Dragontail and Colchuck Peak came into view. The first Bridge Crossing Colchuck Peak through the Trees The Second Bridge Crossing At the lake we enjoyed a nice break which I decided was time to enjoy some cream soda. From here we walked around the lake and started the ascent up the Colchuck Glacier. From here on out we gained elevation quite rapidly in fashionable time, to the South we could see Mount Cashmere, Mount Canon, and Aasgard Pass. As we were climbing we chatted with some guides from New York who stayed with us until we reached the Colchuck Col. Sharp Edge on Colchuck Peak Gimpilator Excited for the Climb Climbers with Cashmere in the Background Redwic Heading Up Halfway up the Colchuck Glacier The Views to the South of the Col At the Col we ditched our packs for the summit, by the now the heat of the day was softening up the snow making for a few posthole steps. On the summit of Colchuck we could see clouds moving in which Gimpilator figured we would be in a white out soon, fortunately that never happened. Redwic near the Summit Endless Mountains Looking West Argonaut Peak's North Face Colchuck Peak Summit Panorama Mount Stuart Panorama Descending back to the Col Dragontail from the Col Dragontail's Ridge Heading over to DragontailWe quickly descended Colchuck back to the Col to pick up our packs and went on over to Dragontail. We misunderstood some info we got online and made attempts to avoid the gulley by cutting right to the ridge. This turned out to be a mistake, after topping out of the ridge all we could see were cliffs and a rappel ring which obviously this was not the way. I carefully explored a bit more and ended up having to down climb some class 3, we gave up and went back to the gulley. The Ridge Above Gimpilator checking out the Ridge The gulley was around 45 degrees or so, but by now the snow was soft enough to feel comfortable heading up, which it was glissade worthy. Pretty soon we reached the top at Pandora's Box which we started to wonder where exactly we should go next. Colchuck Peak's East Face Redwic heading up Dragontail Nearing the top of the Gully Mount Stuart Clearing Up The Crux of the Trip Redwic on the Edge After Gimpilator went around the edge of Pandora's Box he spotted a steep snow slope leading to the Dragontail snow field. ""This is it!"" Gimpilator announced, looking over the edge it looked steep, I could see small cliffs and rocks sticking out which did not make me feel good about the slope. At the time I did not even see the cliffs that were below until after we were past the crux. Gimpilator was the first to go down and kick steps which I'm thankful he did this for us. He stayed perfectly quiet which we figured was him feeling fine but he later said he needed full focus. When Redwic went through he seemed worried at first but then seemed less nervous when almost near the bottom of the crux. Redwic Heading Down the Crux Redwic seen from Below Then it was my turn, I was a bit nervous heading onto the down climb slope but was trying to remain calm. After a few steps down I instantly realized the seriousness of the slope below and the dangers of the cliffs. I now was putting as much effort as possible to kick steps in further, and began to feel vertigo. I don't mind heights, but when my life is on the line, I become quite scared. ""Relax"" I whispered to myself as I went over the crux of the crux (the middle was the steepest part). As I went down my middle and index finger began to go numb as well as my toes which when stepping in I could not feel exactly how far in my foot was in. On top of this I was carrying a over night pack and began to have cramps, this reminded me an awful deal of how Sahale was (although not as bad). I became more worried when I saw how easy my ice axe plopped out of the snow, which I knew that my axe was no longer my life line, my footing now was everything. Redwic every now and then would yell out encouragements which I tried smiling while knowing that I had to get off the slope soon. On my next step I saw part of the step break, this did not make me feel any better. If I had known how the slope would have been perhaps I would have not even attempted going down, but as far as we knew at the time this was the only way to Dragontail from Colchuck. After taking more careful steps I was out of the crux which I felt much better, it was among the top 5 scariest things I have ever done. In mountaineering you always got to be in control, when I'm not, that's when I start to panic. If I was either roped up or had an ice tool I would have felt much safer descending. From here it was a nice easy traverse onto the Dragontail snowfield. Me Descending the Crux The Easy Pathway to Dragontail Peak From Dragontail to CampFrom here it was smooth sailing, the summit of Dragontail from here was relatively easy. At the summit it was a bit cliffy which I quickly touched the summit and went back a few feet to eat (I did not feel comfortable unlike Gimpilator being on the top rock on the summit for a while). Soon we started our descent which I got a nice glissade down to a mini pass. From here we went left down to Aasgard Pass, the snow was punchy making progress slow. Mount Daniel above the Clouds Enchantment Basin Below Dragontail Peak Panorama The Jagged Ridges of Dragontail Peak Heading Down to the Basin Little Annapurna By the time we reached the bottom I could see my knees were all cut up from the ice crystals from falling in many snow holes. We were all pleased to be in the Enchantment basin which is where we put our camp at. After setting up camp I decided to be the cook which in a sense was nice because I got to enjoy the sunset and evening colors over the mountains around us. Sunset on McClellan Peak Our Campsite Sunset on the Rocks Evening in the Enchantment Basin In the morning it was a bright sunny day, when grabbing my boots from outside they were too frozen for me to get my feet into (they loose flexibility). Redwic had to put my boots out in the sun to help thaw them out. In the mean time we boiled more water and I enjoyed some top ramen in the tent. Pretty soon my boots were flexible enough for me to squeeze them on, and pretty soon we were on the move. Next Stop Little Annapurna! Dragontail Peak with Isolation Lake We started out crossing Isolation Lake, I was a little worried with the idea of crossing a lake which had pools of water on the West side of the lake, but we did see foot prints of people who crossed it in mid day, we were crossing it in early morning. Once across we started heading up the slope of Little Annapurna, which turns out to be the easiest of the peaks we climbed during the trip. Aasgard Pass Witches Tower Gimpilator heading up Little Annapurna Looking Down on Enchantment Basin On top of Little Annapurna we looked over to figure out our exact route up Enchantment Peak, and of course had our selves a mini celebration. Blue Ridges from Little Annapurna Redwic on Little Annapurna Little Annapurna's Spires Little Annapurna Panorama Redwic Glissading Down Little Annapurna Our Final Destination: Enchantment PeakThis peak was perhaps the most out of the way, but was certainly a fun one. We descended down the North East Side of Little Annapurna to Inspiration Lake and onto Prusik Pass with a slightly different variation. Along the way we got a very nice place to refill our water and refresh ourselves. From here we then ascended on up to Enchantment Peak which at first we went for one of the false summits by mistake. Enchantment Peak Panorama Prusik Peak Gimpilator leading the Way The Real Summit of Enchantment Peak We then back tracked and went for the East summit which we believe to be the real one. The ending had a bit of class 3 section which Gimpilator calls it ""The Ladder"" because there were nice foot holds although not for the fearful of heights. We were all very pleased to get this summit, but as we looked over we could see incoming clouds which there was potential rain coming in. Gimpilator near the Summit Redwic at the bottom of the Climb Little Annapurna with Clouds The Return Trip Gimpilator glissading Down The way down was a nice big glissade to the lake, and then we had to go up hill once again to get to base camp. We decided to cross around the lake now that it was late in day. At base camp we relaxed for a little while and then packed everything for the return trip down Aasgard Pass. My feet were finally dry from changing my socks but sure enough not 100 feet from camp I fall in 2 snow holes and end up getting my feet wet again. At Aasgard Pass there was a nice glissade to the lower part of the pass, on the way down there was a hidden rock which hurt a bit, but fortunately nothing serious. Gimpilator with Cashmere Peak The Glissade Down Aasgard Pass Looking up the Glissade After looking over the edge I was almost drooling at how nice the glissade ahead looked, I down climbed 200 feet where it was harder snow, but once it got soft, man I was flying down the mountain! 1,000 feet later I decide to wait up for the team, and then go down another 1,000 feet in high speed. At the lake we then get back on trail. From here I had some good conversations with Redwic and Gimpilator and it was a nice mellow walk down to the trailhead. Cashmere with Colchuck Lake Thanks guys for taking me, this was a great experience and beautiful place. I would recommend this to any peak bagger who wants both big peaks and adventure!

As for trying to prove we all had a good time, I wrote at the end of the trip report that I had a great time, you would know if you had a great time, and Gimpilator's video made it pretty clear that he had a good time. So I think that is proof enough to me that we all had a great time! ;-) Snidely Whiplash - Jun 20, 2011 12:25 pm - Voted 10/10 Well done! Way to go. That's an epic trip.

You have some great pictures of some famous peaks I have always heard about. Showing you guys in different parts of the route going up or down really makes the viewer feel like he is there. A great report and some inspiring photos. Josh Lewis - Jun 23, 2011 5:54 pm - Hasn't voted Re: great photos Thanks Mike, I'm glad to hear that. The Cascades are certainly a worthy visit, if you ever do come to these parts, be sure to visit the North Cascades National Park. As for the pics of people, I decided to take a new approach to my photography, in the past I would rarely photograph people, but my brother would complain to me about that. So I figured adding people to the photo would make it seem more personal. Plus the person in the photo I'm sure is pleased. Sierra Ledge Rat - Jun 22, 2011 12:08 am - Voted 10/10 Groovy! ""In mountaineering you always got to be in control, when your not, that's when I start to panic."" I've spent a lot of time going up and down steep slopes, up when I was brave, down when I wasn't, all the while fighting panic. Sometimes I made the summit, sometimes I didn't. Love the glissading pics! Josh Lewis - Jun 23, 2011 5:57 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Groovy! It's a true fact. The more I live through exposure, the more I realize how vulnerable I am, and in a sense the next time I go I'm even more frightened. Most people it is the opposite, but for me I think its good sense kicking in. I've lived through some dangerous mountaineering in my time, and try to avoid it when ever possible. So sometimes it's hard to balance just right between perils and adventure. Because I do have to say I'm very adventurous at the same time!

multi-day,"A Blessing in Disguise
IntroductionThis trip certainly was a defining moment for me in my ever so fast paced and quickly evolving mountaineering career. Here I would be tested mentally and I needed to use my previous experience and knowledge to make this trip the success it was, despite not making the summit. I had been getting messages on the NWHikers forum from someone who has been wanting to go on a climb. However since he was a true vagabond he wasn't up in northern Washington until later in September. The time finally came when he made his way north and I tried to think of a potential group of Bulgers in the North Cascades we could do knowing he was new to snow travel and such. I thought about the Ragged Ridge Traverse, Mount Logan, Golden Horn and Tower Mountain but I finally decided halfway to Burlington that we should do Primus Peak. This decision was both good and bad but turned out to be a huge blessing in disguise. Below is the story about our adventure and a good accomplishment for me despite missing the summit. Starting OutWe made our way to the Thunder Creek Trailhead where we gathered up our things and started up the trail pretty quickly. Paul was carrying a whole lot of stuff and after 15 minutes on the trail he realized he forgot his food in the car. I thought to myself how that was possible he was already carrying almost as much as he could carry. So I wait for him to go grab his food and he comes back with an enormous bag of homemade yams, apples, pears and bananas. Now he did tell me he never eats wheat or grain products so I expected him to bring fruits and veggies however he brought enough to feed an army for over a week! As we continued up the trail it was very evident we were not going to make the climb up the steep ridge of Tricouni Peak that day so we decided to just hike to the McAllister camp after seven miles and bring bivy gear up the ridge the next day. Thank goodness there is a bridge over Thunder Creek here or no one would ever get across this raging river like creek! I told Paul he needed to leave half his stuff and food behind or he would never make it. So we rolled into camp, cooked a nice meal, built a six foot cairn along Thunder Creek and went quickly to sleep. The weather was very warm and the sky was clearing. The dense canopy of trees made it dark much earlier than I had been used to all summer long. But the season was winding down and the days were getting shorter. After a nice rest, we re-packed, hung the spare food and started up the long, long ridge. This ridge is technically called the ""lower north ridge of Tricouni Peak"" and it sure is a real pain in the ass. We ascended 800 feet on a steep boot path (which was a surprise to find) to an opening where we saw our first views across McAllister Creek towards Snowfield Peak. This climb just got steeper as we had to skirt around a series of cliffs but eventually we got to an area where the trees were very small and very close together where the terrain flattened slightly. But it got worse quickly and the worst part of the climb was an area of bad slide alder right before a big view point. We stood atop a nice rock for our first panoramic views of the trip. I was in awe at the immense beauty I was looking at. I was home... Just beyond this viewpoint, the ridge became flat for a ways where the boot path was harder to follow. I just stayed on the crest of the ridge and when it steepened once again the trees began to thin out and we started to see much more color. This was what I had been waiting over two years for! Finally I got to see for myself the true Cascades fall foliage. First I saw bright red in the maples down low, then the small bushes closer to treeline were orange and red and finally, as we rolled into the bivy site at the base of Tricouni Peak I saw my very first golden larch trees. Looking down the ridge we just came up Perfect fall foliage Paul setting up camp I was speechless and at a loss for words at what I was seeing. Certainly far more beautiful than anything I have seen in Colorado. When the nice soft dirt and shrubs turned into rock and talus on the ridge we located the bivy site and set up shop for the night. By the nature of the clouds that afternoon I knew we were in for a sunset of just epic proportions. So I waited and relaxed at one of the best places I have ever been. A beautiful green colored lake lie at the base of the dying Borelis Glacier. The route up to lucky pass looked difficult at best and I was unable to locate a nice route up through the ice or the loose rock to the climbers left which was to my disappoint but in a place this beautiful, I could hardly complain. I was so in awe about the beauty the summit just seemed secondary. The Reason I Climb...There are many reasons why I climb mountains however one of the biggest reasons is to see for myself the wonders of this Earth we live on. I am not going to say much because words cannot describe what I saw during those next 15 hours. The phrase a picture is worth a thousand words carries great weight here and I invite you to enjoy for yourself the beauty of this place that I want to share through my photos. Although they do no justice, I hope they can bring joy to others during the holiday season. They are the best photos I got in 2012 which says a whole lot because I have been to a lot of places this year. The Sunset Snowfield Peak Alpenglow Sunset over Mount Logan Mount Logan at its best At a loss of words Tricouni Peak Primus Peak Sunset Snowfield Peak Tricouni Peak Sunset North Cascades Mount Logan Sunset Panorama Black Peak, Ragged Ridge and Fisher Creek Primus and Tricouni Peaks The Sunrise We slept under the stars that night and it was very moist in the air. It was a bright full moon but at times we saw fog roll through. Our stuff was very wet and frosty the next morning but this sunrise ranked the best sunrise I have ever seen without a shadow of a doubt. The crystal clear air, the gorgeous colors, the fog below us in the valley, and the rugged peaks surrounding us all came together perfectly. Primus Peak Sunrise Snowfield Peak and fog The perfect Cascades Sunrise complete with valley fog Sunrise with Jack Mountain Snowfield Peak Snowfield Peak Borelis Lake Sunrise over Fisher Creek North Cascades Sunrise Panorama My Primus AttemptPaul decided he wanted to stay back and relax but I had to at least make an attempt at climbing Primus Peak. With the route to Lucky Pass out, the standard east ridge which is nothing more than a walk wasn't available. I scouted out other options. The north ridge from what I was able to see from our bivy didn't look too bad so I started by hiking east around Borelis Lake and climbing up to the crest of the North Ridge. I went up beautiful meadow land with alpine larches at their peak which then turned into gentle snow slopes until I reached the crest of the north ridge. The gentle look of this ridge I saw from camp changed into a jagged, serrated loose pile of crap ridge that certainly was at least 4th class. So I decided to cross over and try to find a way up on the west side of the ridge. I tried traversing the rock above the unnamed glacier on the peaks NW side to no avail. This rock was all very loose and I even sent a big one tumbling down the glacier. Next I tried travering in the big moat trying to get to the West ridge which I knew was only class 3. However I ran into bullet ice on the rock from dripping snow above me and I could not risk falling deeper into the moat and risk getting stuck deep under the glacier to freeze to death. I was already underneath massive amounts of snow as it was. So I retreated and tried to traverse the glacier on the edge at the surface. If someone was with me this would have been very easy as I could have just traversed across to the west ridge and scrambled to the summit. Although I may have been fine doing it solo especially since the snow was so hard I just didn't want to walk across a glacier alone. The west ridge was so close but I saw huge cracks in the glacier and knew if I went across and something broke it wasn't survivable. Without further adieu, I tried my final option...the North Ridge direct. I knew nothing about the route but inside I hoped it wasn't 5th class. I started my way up the really loose rock and quickly made some 4th class moves. The exposure was increasing dramatically as I ascended. I got to a notch and traversed left onto the east side to avoid a cliff but soon came to a steep jump in the ridge that was most certainly 5th class. With no one to belay me I was stuck. The route looked 5.6 with no alternatives so I was forced to retreat. I even had to set up a couple rappel anchors as I had climbed up things I didn't want to down climb. Luckily I brought my 30 meter alpine rope with me which came in handy. I conceded and allowed Primus Peak the victory this time but noted I would be back during a weaker time for the mountain...when it is sealed closed under lots of snow. Late September is just way to late in the season in this area. With that the case though, I still captured part of Primus Peaks' soul within my photos that I hope you enjoy. Primus and Larches Borelis Lake Borelis Lake and Red Mountain Tricouni Peak and Larches Alpine Larches The icy route to Lucky Pass Borelis Lake Primus Peak I think you're getting the idea Looking down on the N Ridge Looking across the unnamed glacier I needed to cross The ReturnSo I retreated back down to camp where I met up with Paul once again. He had a great time relaxing and enjoying the scenery. He was very happy to have joined on the trip and was satisfied with his time in Washington. We talked a lot about where he was going to be headed in the next couple years. He had plans to head to South America, Europe and Asia and was traveling the world. I was very envious. We started back down the ridge (which I was NOT looking forward to descending) and almost instantly we got off route and into major bushwhacking. Why is it that going down you always manage to miss the route I don't know but for some reason it always happens. We had to side hill on very steep bushy terrain to get back to the ridge crest and continue down the right way. We got back to the flat section of ridge and quickly made our way across. The rest of the descent was long and uneventful all the way back to McAllister camp where it got dark on us and we spent a second night there. The next morning we packed up and hiked the 7 miles to the car. As I said, although I didn't summit anything on this trip and upon reaching the car I branded this trip a failure, I soon realized especially after reviewing the photos at home that this was one of the best trips of the year for me. This was a blessing in disguise. See below for a map of Primus Peak and its routes and our approach.

single-day,"The Struggling Bear on Blowout Mountain
The Struggling Bear on Blowout  MountainIt had been a long since I have been on a hike with my husband EastKing. This is largely due to the fact I have fibromyalgia and do not do well in the recent surge of extreme heat that has hit the Pacific Northwest this summer. I have deteriorated dramatically in terms of any progress with my weight with it now over a very negative milestone and that has been hard to swallow emotionally. I know I have to take more action to do something about it but I know it is going to be hard to find any hiking partners who are patient enough to go and who would be willing to endure my slowness and current physical limitations. I may struggle now I but I soon hope not to struggle as bad in the future. Our Route BearQueen on the move through the huckleberries! I was very slow on the hike up this mountain. EastKing could not have picked a better mountain to go up but my fatigue and recent weight gain was making this mountain a real struggle. I could feel the pain from the lack of hiking I have done this year. After all how can a 5 mile, 800 foot elevation gain walk-up with no scrambles be so hard? Despite all the struggles heading up the mountain, I really LOVED this trail. It is so scenic and beautiful. What really made it stand out was all of the thousands and thousands of spruce trees that dot the landscape, making it look like a tranquil wonderland in summer.  It would have been complete if waterfalls were dotting the landscape, but one cannot have everything!  The total hike is high on the ridge so there are not any good water sources on this trail. There were huckleberry bushes all along the trail and they were in season. Eating these huckleberries made EastKing and I take longer going up to this summit and coming back. Hooray!!! The views on the summit of Blowout Mountain are SO REWARDING. Outside of a couple trees in some spots, the views here were completely panoramic. To the north lied distant view of Stuart, Daniel, and hundreds of mountains that I can only dream about getting to the top of. Rainier was unfortunately covered by clouds but the mountains to the east of Rainier were out and very beautiful. At the very top of the mountain lies an amazing rock to sit on and enjoy the views. Getting to the summit was so WONDERFUL after the summer I have been having and EastKing and I really savored the view from the summit and spent some real quality time together, which we needed. The summit rock of Blowout Mountain Mount Stuart from the summit I personally find the dirt road that is at least seven miles up to being very nerve-wracking.  The initial part of the road has potholes, but then it evens out, but the road gets steeper and curves around the mountain with more exposure. For those of us with vertigo, it is scary at times. The road is in decent shape and is doable with a passenger car but it can be narrow in places which terrified me. Evening sunsets on this road can be dangerous so wait until the sun is below the horizon before taking this road back down. At times we were blinded by the sun on the way back. Looking east EastKing enjoying the view! I have to say that I really need all of the emotional support and encouragement that I can get from other hikers.  I am now at a dangerous weight and I am the heaviest weight I have ever been that is a culmination of many different things and I am already beating myself up for it. If you read this and want to on some really easy but beautiful hikes, let me know. I am motivated to keep moving and getting outside and have a good list of smaller mountains that I want to do this year. Hopefully I one day will be able to write up a much better adventure in the future. Maybe one day I will stand on some of these summits!!

multi-day,"Why they call 'em the Goat Rocks, and a tale of separation.
The ApproachI've had my eye on the Goat Rocks in southern Washington for some time now. My first idea was a solo trip to Cold Lake and a summit of Tieton Peak, but I had to cancel those plans due to bad weather. Two weeks later, a promising forecast, a three day weekend, and partner to share the trip with were enough to finally explore this wonderful area. My main scrambling partner of the last two years and I took a Friday off from work and drove the 3 hours from Portland to the Snowgrass Trailhead. Our plan was to hike trail 96 and cutoff trail 97 to the PCT and make our way to Cispus Basin. From here we would set up camp and scrabmle as many peaks as we could over the weekend. I ended up having my best experience in Washington's mountains so far, and learned some lessons about hydration, route finding, and staying with your partner. Goat Rocks from the PCT Trevin on the PCT Trevin and I left Portland at a leisurely 8:45 am on Friday morning and drove to the Snowgrass Trailhead. We arrived at about 11:30 and were promptly greeted by a gentle misting of mosquitoes. After a less than refreshing shower of DEET we threw our packs on and headed out on the trail. The first couple miles slowly descended to a bridged river crossing, and then began to gain elevation as we made our way to Snowgrass Flats. About a mile after we started to gain elevation, Trevin began to move a little more slowly. Shortly after that we had to stop to rest as he was feeling dizzy and lightheaded. ""I've never felt like this before"" he said as we waited for the dizzyness to subside. Without going into details for his sake, we peiced together that he was probably dehydrated from an illness the previous two days. Since we had more than enough time, we took it slow and made sure he drank plenty of water as we made our way towards our destination. About a mile and a half from Snowgrass Flats, we ran into an older couple who were returning from a summit of Ives Peak. They gave us a brief synopsis of the Ives trail and a heads up that there were several ""impassable"" waterfalls ahead. Soon after we parted ways we discovered what they were talking about. After scampering over a couple easy creek crossings we came across a moderately difficult one. It took about 8 steps to cross and required some careful foot and trekking pole placements, but we made it across without wet feet. As we approached the PCT's crossing of the Cispus River we took note of a couple deer grazing in the meadow below and began to look for the established camp site located at this crossing. We didn't see it right away and began to hike up the western slopes of Cispus Basin looking for a place to set up camp. Why They Call 'em the Goat Rocks Mountain Goat and Kid I was a couple hundred feet above Trevin when I spotted a mountain goat and his / her kid. I froze so I didn't startle them and pulled out my camera for a couple pictures. After a few seconds of staring at me, they began to scamper off. I wasn't satisfied with the pictures I had taken, so I threw off my pack and gave chase. I hadn't seen a moutain goat in over a year and the sight of the goat and it's kid gave me a burst of energy I didn't know was possible. As quickly and as quietly as possible I sprinted after them, snapping a few more decent pictures before they finally lost me. At this point I was at about 6800 feet and when I looked up the ridge and saw a dozen more goats making their way west across a flat spot around 7400 feet. Goats on the move! I snapped some photos, and then sprinted back to where I had dumped my pack to find Trevin. He had never seen mountain goats before so I was eager to show them to him. He was pretty exhaused when I found him, but he slowly made it up to the 6800 point where I had last seen them. They were gone. I suggested skirting around the ridge to see if we could spot them coming out on the other side, but he wasn't up for it. I went by myself and saw 6-7 more heading back east, one of which had a yellow tracker box around his neck. I came back around the ridge and Trevin and I made our way back to where we had left our packs. He was pretty tired and still dehydrated, so we just decided to set up camp there. He pulled out his air mattress and rested while went to get a bucket of water for us. As I was filling up I looked over at the slopes just to the west of ""the"" goat rocks and was completely shocked to see 40 more goats hanging out on the scree!!! Goats galore! (zoom in) I had seen maybe 10 mountain goats in my entire life and had just quintupled that number in the matter of 20 to 30 minutes. I ran back up to camp and pointed out the goats to Trevin. We sat there and watched them scramble around for about half and hour until they eventually made their way over the pass to the north. After another hour of rest and about 4 liters of water in Trevin's stomach (he was kinda thirsty...) we loaded up our day packs and make our way up to the pass we had seen the goats on. When we got to the pass there were no goats to be seen so we looked around for some peaks to summit. Trevin was curious if there was any class 3 or 4 routes on the NW end of ""the"" goat rocks, which was just east of the pass we were at. I offered to scramble up the scree to the base of the rocks to check it out while he rested. He took me up on the offer and I made my way up. Tieton Peak and Goats Family Day in the Goat Rocks As I reached a high spot, I startled 6 or so goats resting there. Two took of to the north, and four went east toward the rock formations. I snapped a couple photos and quietly crept north following the two goats making sure to step on the large rocks instead of the scree as to not disturb or startle any other goats that might be in the area. As I reached a point where the valley to the north along with Tieton Peak came into view I discovered where the 40 goats we had seen earlier ran off to. They were all hanging out on a sandy flat spot about 30 feet in front of me. I was successful in not startling the goats, but my scent gave me away and they eventually took notice of my presence. Most of them occasionally glanced over at me as I took pictures, but a few of the parent goats decided to take their kids across a snow field to leave the area. Not wanting to break up the goat convention, I quietly retreated after I had a few good pics to remember the experience. Day One's Scrambling View E-SE from Ives After seeing the goats and quickly and easily determining that there were no safe scrambling opportunities in the area, Trevin and I headed west and summited peak 7476. It was a short and easy class 2/3 hike up to the summit and had amazing views of Ives Peak, Old Snowy, McCall Glacier, and Rainier off in the distance. Ives, Old Snowy, and Rainier We determined that we had about 3-4 hours of daylight left and after some discussion, I was able to convince Trevin to scramble over and summit Ives via the east ridge. ""Ok..."" he said, ""but don't be surprised if I tell you I hate you in an hour and a half."" I smiled and we made our way down to the saddle between 7476 and Ives, then over to Ives' east ridge. Apparently there is some sort of trail up to the summit, but from where we were at we decided to just stick to the rocks and boulders. This was a pretty fun scramble. Most of it was class 3 on solid predictable boulders, but I was able to find a couple sections of class 4 rock to scramble up for some extra challenge and enjoyment. The view from the summit was truly amazing! Of all the peaks I summited over this weekend, this view had to be the best. Trevin also agreed with me. He said ""Do you remember when I said I was going to hate you in an hour and a half? Well, I was wrong... this is awesome!"" We soaked in the views for a few minutes and then headed back to camp. We cooked some food while I played guitar, enjoyed a wonderful sunset, and stared at the stars until we went to bed at 11:00. Goat Rocks Massif Peak 6735 and Adams Day Two: a Tale of Seperation Camp in Cispus Basin We slept in super late in the morning and got up at 9:00. We ate some breakfast, packed up our daypacks, and headed out to climb some more peaks. The primary goal for the day was to climb Gilbert Peak, the tallest in the Goat Rocks. I also had my eye on peak 6735 to the south of Cispus Pass ever since we got there, so we decided to start with that one. Peak 6735 We made our way around Cispus Basin and hiked up a snow crease eventually topping out on peak 6872. It was at this point I wish we would have done things a little differently. Looking south along the ridgeline towards peak 6735, Trevin decided it wasn't worth it to him to go down, up, down, and up again just to climb peak 6735. I, on the other hand, was all about it and didn't want to leave the area without climbing it. After thinking about the situation we came up with a few ideas: He could wait on 6872 for me to summit and return, or we could both go to Gilbert now and I could run over and tag 6735 on the way back. He didn't like either of these as they both involved him waiting for me at some point. We finally decided that he would start heading toward Gilbert and I would head over to 6735, summit it, and catch up to him when I could. I usually hike a good deal faster than him so it sounded like a good idea. This turned out to be not such a good idea as the route over to Gilbert was a class 3 traverse where good route finding was needed to avoid class 4 and 5 terrain. More on that in a second. I wanted to bag peak 6735 as quickly as possible so I literally ran along the ridge over to the base of the peak. As I approached the north ridge of 6735 it looked a little steeper than I had imagined, but looked well within my ablities. I began to scramble up the class 3/4 ridge which was pretty fun until about 70 feet below the summit. Here it got a little steeper and I decided I had better try and find an easier route up. I traversed to the left across some dirty ledges and eventually found a comfortalbe scramble to summit. It was a pretty fun climb all in all, but could easily get ugly if your route finding and decision making are poor. I didn't want to down climb the north ridge so I went south, wrapped around the west face, and traversed the snow and scree below the cliffs. It sucked. I slipped once on the snow and scraped my knee a little and the footing on the scree was terrible. Eventually I just glissaded down a snow patch and over to a grassy area where I re-gained the ridge and made my way back up to peak 6872 where I had left Trevin. We had discussed the route to take over to Gilbert... stick to the band of white aggragate, follow the goat path, etc. so I had a pretty good idea where he would be. I made my way down to the base of the rocks and started to make my way up. Goat Rocks from Peak 6735 As I started to climb, the terrain around me looked a little intimidating. Solid footing and hand holds are plentiful, but are difficult to pick out through all the loose rock and dirt with out a good eye for route finding. About 20 minutes into the climb I hear Trevin's voice calling my name from just up ahead. ""Sweet!"" I thought, ""I'm catching up to him quicker that I thought!"" I responded with a ""Yeah!?"" and continued on looking for him. Five minutes later I hear him again, but this time behind me. I turned around and saw him on a ledge below and behind me. I yelled out ""What are you doing?"" and he replied ""I got stuck man, this sucks! I kept running into class 5 sh**... I almost died twice! I'm heading back."" We both just stood there for about 10 minutes. I wasn't having any trouble finding my way across the rock, but Trevin obviously was and didn't want to continue. He was almost to the base of the rocks so I asked him if he could find a safe route down. He said he would be ok, so he continued down and I continued up. This is a really confusing traverse with all the spires, gullies, and undulating terrain. I knew the route was to traverse across the white aggragate and avoid going up too much, but as I continued there was no obvious path to follow so I went up anyway as it was more comfortable. It turned out ok as I just had to descend some snow and scree for a couple hundred feet to reach the final saddle below Gilbert Peak. The rest of the way was just a class 2 dirt and rock march up to the final class 3 summit block. I hit the summit, took a self photo from the west summit, ate an energy bar and headed back the way I came. Marmot Gilbert Peak Self Photo I actually had more fun on the downclimb than on the way up. I took basically the same route back, but dropped down one of the earlier gullies and traversed my way back to the pass. I had a blast route finding on the way down, stoping every 50 steps or so to look for the path with the most solid footing... down climbing is fun! Once I gained the pass I made my way back through the snow and found Trevin safely at camp. Although I had a really fun time the second day, Trevin felt it was the ""scarriest and stupidest thing I (he) had ever done"". We both learned some valuable lessons that day. I was disappointed to hear my climbing partner of the last two years say that a climb I enjoyed so much was hell for him. When we were on top of peak 6872 and decided to go seperate ways, I figured he would be able to navigate through the class 3 terrain with out any problems. We had been on a dozen or so scrambles together including the Big Gully route of Castle Peak, ID and other challenging scrambles and hadn't had any problems like this before. After the trip when I got to thinking about the situation I realized that it was route finding ability that made this climb so difficult for him. Usually when we hike together I'm a little faster so I end up going first with him following. That leaves most of the route finding on the trips we do up to me which I am pretty comfortalbe with, but has robbed him of the valuable experience of finding the safest route up a given peak. Had we simply stuck together I know for a fact that he would have been able to complete the traverse as he is a very good climber. Fortunately his decision making is top notch and he was able to turn back without getting himself hurt or worse. Next time we scramble together, we're sticking together... and I think I'll let him lead. Images View Why they call 'em the Goat Rocks, and a tale of separation.

single-day,"Getting Back Into the Swing of Things: Triple Couloirs Car to Car
Introduction Due to serious head aches, pain, and getting busy I haven't written a climbing report in a long time. Fortunately things have gotten better, been working out, going on 5 mile runs, eating healthier, losing weight, becoming a lightweight-aholic (gear wise), and am back on the road to alpinism. January Will and I climbed the North Buttress Couloir of Colchuck as a starter kit for the year. Avalanches, bad weather, sickness, and extreme pain had it's vengeance February through April. Rather than throwing my hands up I kept training, stayed motivated, and sought after the opportune moment to get my first multi pitch ice lead in. Triple Couloirs has been on my to do list for a long time, definitely a great route. With 6840 feet of gain, 20 miles, 18.5 hours of hiking & climbing, 4 pitches, and a lot of kicking in steps it made for a good work out. Triple Couloirs Diagram We woke up at 4:15 a.m. and were hiking up the 4 mile road by 4:45 a.m. There wasn't snow until the last 1/3 mile. As others have mentioned the trail is completely solid making the hike to Colchuck Lake luxurious. After the second creek crossing shortly beyond the Stuart Lake junction we re-filled our water. Making excellent time walking across the lake, felt refreshing to have the entire place to ourselves. At the base of the route we put on our harnesses, crampons, and ice tools. I was extremely pleased that the route was in. Hiking up to Colchuck Lake Coolwars and Ice Battles The ramp had alright snow conditions, some ice/snice, with occasional tool placement failures due to soft snow. Inside the first couloir the snow climbing felt cozier while having dazzling theatrics above. At the top of the couloir we enter the Runnels which is when things started spicining up. It was the beginning of the ominous sound track the mountains play as the day progresses. Ice chunks coming down, loud humming of snow/rock chunks, and small doses of spin drift. I dug a small ledge just wide enough to setup a belay. As Thatcher setup the anchor, I did an alpine dance to regain feeling into my toes and fingers. Colchuck Peak's North Face Thatcher with Cashmere Mountain Buttresses on Enchantment Peak Looking up the stair case to the first Couloir Climbing the First Couloir The first pitch went well, was able to get a nut in the wall followed by two snow pickets for the anchor. The second pitch is when things got more exciting, was torn between which runnel to climb. I choose the one on the right, the left one was probably better. The ice was thin in a few places and sloppy in others. Fortunately was able to find a spot that would accept a screw. After climbing another 50 feet higher I looked around for another potential protection placement, non could be found. The crux was a little tricky due to softening snow, ice tool placements were iffy at times making it essential to kick in good steps. ""Impeccable timing"" I sigh to myself as my legs cramp up. After taking a few deep breathes I carefully climb over the crux. As the rope length ran out I desperately looked around for a place to setup a belay. Every ice screw placement either hit rock or broke due to loose snow. Seeing that I was out of options I used a last resort move which was to bury my ice tools and compress the snow around it. After stress loading it and giving it hard pulls, the anchor seemed strong enough to hold a non lead fall. For further protection my legs were anchored in so that I could bear some of the weight as a precaution. The Runnels Topping out of the Crux Thatcher made it up the pitch in good time, he took the lead for the second couloir which we simul climbed. Felt amazing to follow steps in such an exciting environment and be head ache free. As the snow softened more we heard the roar of a small avalanche on the mountain adjacent to us. Seeing that it was getting late I took the lead up the third couloir past the Aasgardian Gendarme. As we topped out I could see weather was coming in. The traverse to the summit was mellow, albeit I had to watch out for the cornice near the summit. Climbing the Second Couloir Topping out of the Second Couloir Dramatic Spires rise above the Triple Couloirs Climbing below the Dragon Sword Topping out of Triple Couloirs Mount Stuart and Sherpa Peak Let's Book it Out of food, water, and time we didn't spend long on the summit. Looking below I could see our descent route had nasty cornices making for a potentially precarious descent. As we near the Dragon Col I start picking up the vibe that a potentially deadly cornice is blocking the route. Luckily there was a slightly steep escape ramp that bypassed the standard route making for an easy descent down to Enchantment's basin. Was able to get a few glissades in around Aasgard Pass. At Colchuck Lake we could see that significant melting had occurred, near the end of the lake our foot prints were already submerged in water. Thatcher discovered that we could refill our bottles from the lake itself which was very exciting news for our parched lips. Cornices along our escape route The Route we considered McClellan Peak with Gloomy Weather Cross the lake at first was iffy. Our steps sank further in to the point of soaking my boots with blue water. After becoming unreasonable I announce ""I'm out"". While walking along the shore we found that the western shore was more solid, making it a viable option for crossing. Keeping a fair distance from each other we walked across the lake. After getting off the lake we hiked down the icy and slushy trail in evening light. Was interested to see it transition rapidly back and forth. Just beyond the trailhead Thatcher put on his approach shoes while I walked down in my mob buckets. Needless to say we were extremely pleased to arrive at the car.

multi-day,"No Small Effort For Big Horn
PROLOGUEOf the 20 most technically difficult county highpoints in the contiguous United States, also known as “Apex” county highpoints, seven are located in Washington. Of those seven peaks, I was fortunate enough to have summited two of the most technically difficult, Mount Olympus and Bonanza Peak, at the beginning of July. After those trips were completed I only required summiting two more peaks, Big Horn and Mount Baker, to complete the Washington County Highpoints. Of those two peaks, Big Horn is considered to be much more technically difficult than Mount Baker. In fact, many people consider the “crux” move near the summit of Big Horn to be the most difficult crux move of any county highpoint in the contiguous United States. I knew that Big Horn would likely be my last big obstacle before completing the Washington County Highpoints list. Big Horn Looms Above Cispus Basin I began seriously considering an attempt of Big Horn starting the previous year. My biggest concern was not the peak itself but rather who I would make an attempt with. Due to my own inability to lead rock climbs at this stage, I immediately knew that I would need to find a competent rope leader who would be comfortable in that role. However, most of my county highpointer friends had already summited the peak and I was not aware of any person willing to summit the peak twice. Knowing that few people outside of county highpointers attempt Big Horn, I began wondering if finding the right team for a successful summit attempt might be more challenging than actually summiting the peak itself. If I was to be a part of any potential summit team for Big Horn I wanted to make certain that I would be with the right people for such an endeavor. The people would need a variety of mountaineering experience and skills, and perhaps more importantly would need to be people who I could completely trust to be with on such a technical peak. The Horns Of Goat Rocks (Big Horn In Center) As luck would have it, I was invited to join a potential summit party. The group was to consist of several mountaineers: Adam Helman (who for the remainder of this trip report will be referred to only as Adam), Greg Slayden, Adam Walker (who for the remainder of this trip report will be referred to only as Gimpilator), Eric Noel, and I. Adam needed Big Horn as part of his quest to summit each of the county highpoints in the western United States. Greg had summited Big Horn during early July 2007 despite suffering from an accident during the ascent, and was surprisingly willing to go back one more time (which virtually nobody does with Big Horn) to lead our group. Moreover, because Adam had done much of the planning for their successful mountaineering trip in South America earlier during the year, Greg wanted to help return the favor to him. Gimpilator was not a county highpointer and had little knowledge of Big Horn outside of what I had mentioned to him on several occasions, but he had always wanted to visit the Goat Rock Wilderness Area where Big Horn is located. Eric unexpectedly backed-out of the team several days prior to trip due to other commitments, and after his departure we kept the team small and intact to enhance our chances for success. I wanted to optimize our chances for success by driving to the trailhead on Friday evening, but that was not the consensus. We would each be carrying heavy backpacks, which would be especially more difficult for Adam to do considering his small size (5' 7"", 110 lbs). Plus, Greg worked on Friday, so it was decided that Saturday would be our low-key, non-technical day. We planned to start hiking midday on Saturday, find a decent campsite area in Cispus Basin that afternoon, and then make a summit attempt on Sunday. That plan did not allow room for error in case of bad weather on Sunday, but we were fortunate to have a weather forecast that looked good. DAY ONE: Greetings And The March To CispusI picked up Gimpilator and Greg on Saturday morning, July 30. We drove over three hours to reach the Snowgrass Flats Hiker Trailhead #96A (~4650’ elevation). Adam was waiting at the trailhead for our arrival. This was my first time meeting Adam, and I quickly discovered he has a vast knowledge of peaks in general and county highpoints specifically. After our various introductions and gear sorting, we began hiking at 11:35 AM. The weather was very good and there was no snow along the lower section of the trail. We encountered occasional minor patches of snow prior to the bridge crossing Goat Creek, but nothing significant. After Goat Creek, the snow became more frequent. At one point, the snow covered over the trail so much that we lost the trail route altogether. Greg and I each had GPS devices that showed our intended direction straight ahead, although we later discovered during our descent that the trail system actually switchbacked along a hillside to the west of where we had lost the trail route. Greg and I had the team continue straight along snowy terrain towards where our GPS devices showed the trail reaching a creek crossing. It was during this part of our route that I began to realize just how much Adam hated trekking with snow. Considering Adam lived in southern California, I could understand why he might have some uncomfortability with hiking across snowy terrain. However, considering Adam had summited all but 11 county highpoints in the western United States, including some of the snowiest and most technical county highpoints, I was shocked to see him express such discomfort just hiking along snow, which was not at all steep terrain. He claimed this discomfort resulted from what he considered ""a perfect storm"" which he had never previously encountered all at once: a heavy backpack (which nearly equalled half his body weight), side-traversing along hilly terrain, and slushy snow. With that said, he was determined to continue and we maintained a good pace. At 1:35 PM we reached major creek crossing at the same location that the actual trail crossed it. Without a bridge present, we had to ford the creek using rock-hopping techniques. We each took several minutes to examine the various options. Greg, Gimpilator, and I were comfortable with one particular section to cross, while Adam found a section further upstream that he thought looked easier to cross. Fording A Creek Once on the other side of the creek, a wooden sign pointed our team in the correct direction, and although there was continuous snowpack to traverse, the route was relatively straightforward to follow. Within an hour, we reached a junction with the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) and decided to take a break there. Despite the snowpack, we could see and follow several bootprint tracks along the PCT. Where tracks were not present, we could still trace the PCT route fairly simply. The route soon began side-traversing along snowy slopes, which increased Adam's dissatisfaction with the terrain conditions. We eventually reached open talus slopes followed by meadow slopes, prior to reaching Cispus Basin. These slopes had more exposure to direct sunlight than the rest of our earlier route, and there were numerous sections already melted-out as a result. Small streams passed across the trail under multiple snowy sections, for which we used extra caution crossing. One decent-size waterfall crossing was required, but still nothing trivial. Side-Traverse On PCT Approaching Cispus Basin We finally reached our camp (~6150’ elevation) at Cispus Basin at 4:05 PM, exactly 7.5 miles and 4h30m from the trailhead. Shortly after reaching camp, I looked slightly northeast towards our next day’s goal of Big Horn. While looking up the basin I saw a lot of movement along the snow at the base of the rocky ridgeline near the peak. I quickly realized that the movement was a large herd of mountain goats trekking across the upper basin. In total, I counted nearly four dozen mountain goats, far exceeding any herd total I had ever previously seen. After watching the goats for a while, we spent the remaining daylight hours setting up our tents, resting, making dinner, and preparing our gear for the following day… our summit day. Cispus Basin Nearly Four Dozen Mountain Goats! Big Horn At Sunset DAY TWO: Great Team, Good Snow, Bad Rock, And Worthy SummitThe following morning, July 31, our team began leaving camp at 5:35 AM. We reached a mountain pass (~6900’ elevation) at 6:10 AM. The pass has no official name, although Greg dubbed it “Black Thumb Pass” due to its close proximity to a rock spire nicknamed “Black Thumb”. There was a lot of evidence of previous mountain goat activity at the pass, especially where they had rested and left tuffs of hair on the ground. Our group put on our helmets (although my helmet was already on when I had left camp) and crampons (except Gimpilator). Then we continued heading east over the pass. Summit Day Begins! ""Black Thumb Pass"" We passed by two steep snow gullies before reaching a gully located immediately prior to a stream gully. We ascended the steep snow slope for ~100’ before Adam found a rock rib to scramble for a while. Gimpilator did the same. Greg and I continued on the snow because it seemed safer, more straightforward, and less labor-intensive. Eventually, the rock rib ended at a large rock-snow moat, forcing Adam and Gimpilator to follow the snowy route being ascended by Greg and I. However, as soon as another rock rib was reached higher up, at ~7300’ elevation, Adam and Gimpilator once again left the snow in favor of a loose rocky scramble. We soon each crossed a short snow slope to a boulder rock outcrop (~7550’ elevation) at 7:30 AM, where we took a 15-minute break. From the boulder outcrop, we could see the rest of our summit approach route. After crossing a steep snow slope, we would reach a steep rock rib that we would scramble for most of the remaining ascent. The upper snow slope that we were about to side-traverse to the rock rib was the same area that Greg sustained a fall during his previous trip to Big Horn during 2007. He showed our team where he had fallen and described how it had happened. Fortunately, our team was able to cross the snowy slope and reach the rock rib safely at 7600’ elevation. Crossing The Last Steep Snow Slope... Adam and Gimpilator were both ecstatic at the prospect of leaving snow a final time for our ascent. After removing our crampons, we began steeply scrambling the rock rib. Due to several steep sections on the leftside and middle sections, we primarily scrambled on the rightside of the rock rib. There was no “wrong” route; we just kept trying to find the path of least resistance and that seemed to work well for us. We finally reached the “crux” section (~7960’ elevation) of our trip, a short but steep rock climb, at 8:45 AM. Greg, Gimpilator, and Adam Scrambling A Rock Rib... Redwic and Adam Scrambling Steep Rock... Scrambling High On Big Horn... Gimpilator Sees The ""Crux"" Section As mentioned earlier, the “crux” move of this section is considered by many people to be the most difficult crux move of any county highpoint in the contiguous United States. Famous local peakbagger Fred Beckey lists this crux move as YDS Class 4, but most people categorize it as being in the YDS Class 5.4-5.6 range. The “crux” section involves ascending a 10’-15’ crack, which would be the shortest rock climbing pitch that Gimpilator and I had ascended during our various trips during that month. Greg setup the rope and led this section, followed by Gimpilator, Adam, and finally me. This took some time, but we were trying to be as safe as possible. I tend to agree with the YDS Class 5.4 rating for this section; there was only one spot in the middle of the rockface that required extra time to ascend, but only slightly so. Once atop the “crux” section, the rest of the ascent was an easy ridge walk (~30’) to the summit (8000’ elevation), which we reached at 9:25 AM. Gimpilator Climbing The ""Crux"" Section Looking Up At The Summit Of Big Horn Reaching the top of Big Horn was quite an achievement for each of us. For Greg, it was his second successful summit of the peak. For Adam, it was his 35th Washington County Highpoint achieved and then only had 10 county highpoints in the western United States still to summit. For Gimpilator, it was his first summit attained in the Goat Rocks Wilderness Area, and he enjoyed the ascent so much that he immediately wanted to attempt more peaks in the region. For me, it was my 38th Washington County Highpoint achieved, leaving only Mount Baker (located in Whatcom County) to complete that peakbagging list. I did not think the summit approach, overall, was more difficult than Mount Olympus or Bonanza Peak. However, due to the steep snow slopes, loose rocky slopes, scrambling, and rock climbing involved, I could easily determine why Big Horn deserves its “Apex” status as one of the more difficult county highpoints to summit. Happy To Have One Less Summit To Climb After taking a break along the summit ridge, we rappeled down the “crux” section and then chose to rappel most of the rock rib rather than downclimb it. Doing so required more time but also seemed safer than downclimbing. The rappeling made us feel much more comfortable, although Gimpilator and I briefly considered steeply descending the snow slope located on the side of the rock rib. After reaching the bottom of the rock rib, we each crossed the steep snowy slopes back to the boulder outcrop at 12:15 PM. Greg Rappels The ""Crux"" Section Greg Leads The Second Rappel... Adam Begins The Second Rappel... Gimpilator Begins The Second Rappel... After taking a 15-minute break there, Greg, Gimpilator, and I began trekking towards Gilbert Peak while Adam decided to stay at the boulder outcrop and rest. We did not reach Gilbert Peak only due to time constraints that day, only getting as far as the upper slopes of Goat Citadel, and we returned to Adam at 2:15 PM. Adam did not like the prospect of descending steep snow slopes, so we sought a better descent option elsewhere. We found a rock rib located near the gully we had ascended. There were several cairns on the rock rib, which gave us confidence that we were on a viable route. The rock rib led our team down the other side of the stream gully that we had avoided on our ascent, forcing us to steeply descend to, and then cross, the stream. After traversing over one final short rock rib on the other side of the stream, we plunge-stepped and glissaded down the remaining 100’ to the basin below. Adam Descends A Loose Rocky Rib I reached “Black Thumb Pass” at 4:10 PM, with the rest of the team a short distance behind me, and then we reached camp at 4:35 PM. After taking a break, gathering water, and tearing-down our campsite, we headed back onto the PCT shortly after 6:00 PM. The descent to the trailhead was mostly uneventful except for reaching our vehicles at 9:40 PM in the dark. Greg, Gimpilator, and I said our “good-byes” to Adam before heading back home at 10:00 PM. Adam, on the other hand, decided to car-camp that evening before heading to Idaho to attempt more county highpoints on his “to do” list. I finally reached my home at 1:50 AM on Monday morning, very tired but very happy to be home safe after a successful trip for Big Horn. TRIP VIDEO SPECIAL THANKSSpecial thanks to Greg Slayden for making this trip possible. His prior knowledge of the route and terrain, combined with his rope-leading skills, really benefited our team. Thanks also to the two Adams, Mr. Helman and Mr. Walker, who were great mountaineering partners and who provided great conversations throughout the trip.

single-day,"Rainier in a Day: A Challenging Escapade
Introduction ""Do not wish for easier lives, wish to be stronger men"" -John F. Kennedy ""I am not an adventurer by choice but by fate."" -Vincent van Gogh This was quite the undertaking. The previous year I climbed Mount Rainier in two days which was a little bit tiring, but not a big deal. This time it was both physically and mentally challenging due to the high altitude. We would be heading up from Sea level to 14,411 feet in about 14 hours which I had never done anything like this. Though out the summer I had been climbing so many mountains that you get to a point where nothing is hard anymore, you find yourself wanting a new challenge, something completely new. On this trip I got more than what I bargained for. My buddy Eastking introduced me to his friend Jordan who turned out to be a nice guy. Jordan called me up asking if I wanted to climb Rainier, his work had his free time limited which I purposed the idea of doing it in a single day. My brother Michael decided to join on this trip making us a solid 3 man rope team. The weather at first was looking quite questionable, but every time I've been on Rainier I was above the clouds. This was perhaps the hardest climb I did all year. A Day AttemptI started off my adventure hiding multiple buses to get to Jordan's house in Seattle. From his house we took off towards Paradise for our Rainier climb. Although it was misty, I was pleased that it was not raining on us when we first stepped out. The snow had been long since gone in comparison to my previous attempt. On our way to Camp Muir I saw some Lupine Flowers, Marmots, and some nice clearings though the clouds. As we near Camp Muir we get above the clouds just in time to see the alpenglow of sunset. It was quite rewarding just getting to Camp Muir. Lupine Flowers Lush Green Forest Marmot on the Rocks Skyline High Point Hiking into the Mist Marmot Upclose Hiking up the Muir Snowfield An Opening in the Sky Walking into Wonderland At camp Muir we decided to take a rest and have dinner before we got up into the higher altitude. My brother noticed that he was running low on head lamp power which he was forced to ask the ranger for extras. The ranger then told us all about the mountain conditions and was nice to us. After getting tried in we were ready to cross the Cowlitz Glacier. Sunset Colors from Camp Muir My brother and I Muir Peak during Sunset Alpenglow from the Cowlitz Hiking Above the Clouds Crossing the Cowlitz was easy as expected, the altitude was not effecting me so far. The Cathedral Rocks were a bit of a hassle because the rope would get caught in the rocks making us have to slow down and whip the rope out of them. As we got near Ingraham Flats Michael was starting to feel the altitude which I kept in mind but did not think much of it. As we got higher breaks became more frequent, but still at a decent pace. When ever I went to get a drink of water I would have ice chunks making it less desirable to get a drink. But I forced myself to because I knew it was necessary. As we got onto the Cleaver I started feeling sleepy. I've always heard about warnings against headaches, dizziness, and other sick feelings when at high altitude. But rarely do I hear about people complaining about getting ridiculously sleepy. I was feeling strong in my legs and in the lungs, but the altitude was starting to get to me. There is a point where we should have turned around sooner, but the ambition and that strive for pushing a challenge compelled us to continue. It wasn't about making the summit. Both Jordan and I have already summited before. Michael's physical condition was deteriorating quite rapidly and I silently nodded knowing that we wouldn't make it. Jordan wanted to see at least how far we could make it. This was now beginning to be a challenge because you just become so tired that you look at a pile of rocks and think to yourself ""That would be so nice if I could just for sec lay down and sleep"" but I knew how dangerous that would be. You tell yourself things like ""Get a hold of yourself, we got a climb to do"". After pressing on for what seemed like hours we were near the top of the Disappointment Cleaver. Michael finally announced that he cannot press on anymore in the condition that he was in. So we finally decided to call it quits and save this for another time. Descending DownGoing down was a bit frightening. I was so sleepy that if we even as much as stood there for a few seconds idol, I would instantly fall asleep. The scariest moments are when you wake up to plunging in your ice axe and feeling like you could have slipped just then down the steep icy slope below. Staying awake was not easy to do when the altitude is effecting you more than you had anticipated. I would end up having to do everything I could to maintain a focus on what I was doing. When we got down lower it was a big releaf. After crossing the Cowlitz Glacier we rested for a while and watched the sunrise. Sunrise on Camp Muir Gibraltar Rock during Sunrise Sunrise on Mount Hood Sunrise on the Tatoosh Heading Back Down Sunrise on Eagle Peak Morning Sunrise to the South Morning Ridges Above Clouds Sunrise on Mount Adams Southwest Views from Rainier The weather now was nearly perfect. The snow was a bit icy on the way down but manageable. After an hour or so we were back to the car. This was quite a tiring trip. But my Rainier goal was not complete yet, a few weeks later I returned. Rainier in a DayFrom my previous day attempt I knew this would be a challenging climb. This time my brother did not come in knowing that it would be too much for him. For the approach Jordan invited a friend who had little mountaineering experience. I was fortunate enough to get a hide from Jordan this time which meant no hours of busing and waiting which was nice. Like the other times, the weather was not looking so good, it was raining on the ride in which I was starting to estimate that we had between a 10-33% chance of making it. ""What food will I need for the trip?"" asked our driver. Jordan replied ""Oh just a subway sandwich"" which I laughed at this comment. ""What would say say for a winter ascent of Rainier?"" I asked. ""Perhaps a second subway sandwich"". Paintbrush Flower Wet Blue Flowers Grouse on Rainier Danger Zone Sign When starting out on the trail my boots felt quite tight making my feet have a pulsing feeling. This worried me, but fortunately this went away after a while of hiking. This was once again the usual hike up through Panorama Point, Pebble Creek and up the Muir Snow field in the fog. Near Camp Muir the fog started to clear up some revealing Rainier although some of it still lingering and rising. This time we made it to Camp Muir at about 3:20 p.m. which we rested for about an hour and started the crossing of the Cowlitz Glacier. Hiking through the Fog Mount Rainier Clearing Up A Hungry Camp Bird Hiking Towards Cathedral Rock Scrambling the rocks during the day is much easier considering that you don't go off route. During the night some of the rock looks similar to the trail making it sometimes slower going. When we got above Cathedral Rock we were officially above the clouds. I suddenly became a lot more optimistic about us making it. Jordan Hiking the Pathway to Ingraham Flats We were making great time, from Camp Muir to Cathedral Gap in about 20 minutes. But just as the weather was getting nicer above, as we cross over to Ingraham Flats the winds start picking up. At this time of year the Ingraham Glacier is quite broken up requiring us to go up a little bit of the Direct Route and then back down in order to get to the Cleaver. There are a few minor crevasse jumpings along the way. Before crossing onto the Cleaver there was perilous section that went over a snow bridge. There was no margin for error here, one one side you have a 50 foot drop below you, if you step in the wrong spot on the bridge it might collapse, and to your right is a very large cliff making this section the second most dangerous part of the climb. Also this spot has rock falling hazard as well. Little Tahoma in Clouds Snow Bridge to the Flats Ingraham Direct Looking into a Crevasse Climbing into Dangerous Terrain The winds returned making the puffy jackets very nice to have. The sun had long since passed beyond the mountain making the air much cooler and giving the landscape an evening like feel. We had to make the best of our day light situation which is why we rushed up the Cleaver. Once we got above the Cleaver we were back on the glacier which was heavily broken up. We ended up having to curve far over to the right to avoid an impassible crevasse field which for the most part there was a pathway. But every now and then we would come across a section that you would ask yourself ""Is this the way?"". Penitentes Above the DC A Break in the Clouds Upper Ingraham Glacier Lenticular Forming on Adams Looking Down the Cleaver Myself Crossing a Crevasse The Pathway during Sunset Darkness came over the mountain, it was time to turn on the headlamps. There were now numerous crevasses that we passed by and step overs that we had to be careful. One of the latters to avoid a crevasse section was out of commission due to the glacier being to broken up. A moment later we came across what I consider the most dangerous part of the route. Most people who climb Rainier won't have to deal with this part as long as they don't climb in late season. The pathway suddenly seemed to have vanished, Jordan and I had to descend in a bowl like section. As Jordan took a few more steps I could head crackling noises and what sounded like we were going to break though! I instantly was in a bit of a panic wondering what would happen next. We spotted a set up rope that crossed over a very precarious crevassed section. It certainly would not be ideal to travel in the same way that the rope was set up. After hearing more crackles and seeing the icicles and the over hang behind us I realized we were on a ice shelf. Fortunately it was so compact and icy that it remained solid. If I recall correctly there was a jump that we had to be very careful about and make a big leap. After the Ice Shelf section and a few mini crevasse crossings things became a lot safer. But at the same time we were gaining altitude. I was becoming very thirsty from the climb, every time I got a drink it was less and less desirable with the fact that the lid and the water was freezing over. It got to the point where I couldn't get the lid off until I banged it on a rock, then I had to use my ice axe to chip out enough ice to get a few sips of water. Looking to the East we could see the moon rising in a bright glorious red color, Jordan asked me ""Wow! Is that the sun?"" which I found humorous because it resembled it quite a bit. Getting up to 14,000 feet was fairly easy with little obstacles. I managed to find a spot that was out of the winds to capture a 60 second shutter speed shot of the view to the East. But the down side was that it made my hands very cold. The Views to the East from 14,000 feet during Night Time I once once again feeling quite sleepy, but unlike last time I felt as though I had a bit more energy in me and by this point we were almost there. Before getting to the crater rim there was a latter that goes over a big crevasse. What made it feel a little worry some was the fact that as you got on the ladder, it slid as you climbed across it. I held onto the provided rope just in case the ladder slid too far and fell in. After the ladder crossing it was a walk to the crater rim. At the crater rim many people unrope here, but we were so tired and the fact that the winds were blowing hard made the idea unappealing. As we crossed the crater rim I started realizing why it might have been a good idea because the rope was constantly catching on Penitentes (ice spikes) making travel a bit more difficult. But soon we were out of the snow and onto the final rock section. I was feeling the altitude more than ever, but with us being 200 feet from the summit we slowly scrambled/hiked to the summit at about 11:20 a.m. I was excited to have completed this challenge. The Summit Crater during Night Time Going Back DownWe stayed on the summit for about 2 minutes because the winds were blowing quite hard making us feel quite cold. The night sky was so beautiful, like being on top of the world. We could see distant city lights while at the same time being above the clouds with the moon shining brightly above. Every 1,000 feet of altitude we lost I felt much better and became less sleepy. My headlamp was semi low on power which for much of the way down I turned it off to save power. The moon light was so bright with the reflecting snow that I could see quite fine. The only real worry some parts on the way down were coming back through the ice shelf and getting off the Disappointment Cleaver. It was kinda funny running into the guides and such at 2 a.m. and telling them that we summited hours ago. The way down was pleasant in the sense that the winds stopped and it seemed warmer than before. After passing through Ingraham camp for some reason we got a little lost looking for the pathway. We had to walk over more mini crevasses looking for the right way until I finally decided it would be best to go towards the ridge of Cathedral Rock which eventually brought us to a boot path. I considered taking off my crampons for the rest of the trip, but kept them on for the Cowlitz Glacier. This turned out to be a bad idea on my end. I was so tired that I kept tripping over my own crampons. I became heavily sleepy and was in a state of stumbling, partly because my ankles were giving way. ""Hold yourself together, maintain focus"" I whispered to myself. A second later I instantly lost focus and nearly fell on my face. This was one of the more miserable moments on the mountain were you start thinking to yourself ""I need to take a break from mountaineering for a little while"". Or at least those are your thoughts on the mountain when your exhausted. Part way across the Cowlitz Glacier I finally decided to take off my crampons because it was too painful to keep stumbling and nearly twisting my ankle on each step. Seeing Camp Muir ahead was such a teaser because I knew our pace was slowing down to a dreadful pace. A while later we arrive at Camp Muir at about 3:52 a.m. and finally take a rest. I'll admit I was not soar, but was mostly sleepy. We decided it would be best to rest for a few hours before going back down. Just getting into my bunk was challenging because every time I did anything, it made quite a bit of noise which people were trying to sleep. I had to make very slow movements but eventually had myself situated. Then I instantly fell sleep. Waking up 2 and a half hours later we decide to finally to pack our gear and head on down. The Muir snow field was a bit icy. I did not feel like wearing crampons again, so what I did was I used the textured snow field where it dips in to help me slow down as I went down hill in fast motion. After getting out of the snow I ran much of the way down in order to get to the parking lot in time to get an official less than 24 hour ascent and descent. On the way I saw some beautiful flowers and marmots. I made it down with time to spare. Blue Ridges though the Clouds Mountain to the West Waterfalls above the Nisqually Lupine Flower with Droplets Preserve Fragile Meadows Yellow Field of Flowers Marmot Down Climbing A Field of Lupines Mist over the Tatoosh Peaks Lupines with the Trail Toosh Ranger with Flowers Lane Peak with a Flag Hiking Back into the Clouds I was disappointed that I had no victory treat because my crampons had punctured a hole in the soda can that I was looking forward to. This happened earlier on in the trip. On the way back home I once again had to take multiple buses. When I got home I could finally get some well deserved rest. Doing this mountain in a single day makes all the difference in the world in the difficulty.

multi-day,"Olympus: 4th Of July Route On The 5th Of July
When I was attending WWU I found a book in the Library called Glorious Failures. In this anthology I read the historical account about the race to be the first to climb Mount Olympus. This challenge was highly publicized in the Seattle area and it took something like 9 months for the would-be climbers to hack their way 18 miles through dense forest and brush to the Blue Glacier. Anyone who has hiked the Hoh River trail can imagine how difficult it must have been on that first trek. Unfortunately, that first summit party made it to the top in a white-out. They returned to Seattle as adventurous heroes, but later it was proven they had climbed the east summit by mistake. Olympus has several summit spires, the west being the highest. Weeks later, another party followed the path which was created and made a successful summit climb in 1907. Olympus Seen From Mount Angeles, August 2007 For most peakbaggers, 44 miles combined with glacier travel and rock climbing in the rainiest part of one of the rainiest states in the country sounds like a daunting challenge. At least it did to me. Furthermore, one of the leading causes of failure on Olympus these days is blisters. But the goal was a worthy one. At 7,969 feet, Olympus is the highest in the Olympic Range and the highest point on the peninsula. If I was successful on this trip, I would be fulfilling a 5-year dream and it would also be my second Mount Olympus. Olympus Seen From Gray Wolf, November 2009 Fortunately, in our team of three, each person had special skills to offer to the group. ""Redwic"" Craig is a gifted planner/organizer and expert navigator; Dave has many years of rock climbing experience, and I've led a lot of rope teams across various glaciers. As trip organizer, Craig insisted that we each reserve a week off of work so that we could optimize our chances of getting a ""weather window"". This irritated my boss (and me), but it later proved to be essential for our success. Mount Tom and ""Janus"" Seen During The Approach We began our approach on July 3rd. The first few miles of the trail were choked with tourists. I couldn't understand what the draw was for this trail because I know hundreds of trails in the Cascades that are far more scenic. We were glad to get deeper into the woods where the real hikers were, people who practice proper trail etiquette. Overall, the first day was uneventful. We hiked the first 10.7 miles to Lewis Meadows, setting up camp right next to the Hoh River. I was very pleased to be missing the loud explosions in the middle of the night on the days preceding our country's Independence Day. Out there in the wilderness I slept like a baby. The Trail, Destroyed By Avalanche As we suspected, the second day was harder. Each of our packs was over 50 pounds and we had to gain 3,000 feet in 6.9 miles to reach Glacier Meadows, our staging area for summit day. As we had heard over the last few years, this section of the trail was thrashed. Many avalanches have totally wiped out the trail. One chute was over 100 meters across. In the preceding year, the park system had set up a rope ladder on the steep side of the chute, but this year we found only a hand line. Blue Glacier Ice Falls Upon arrival in Glacier Meadows, the snow was in rapid melt-off with runoff streams everywhere. That made collecting water much easier. We had carried a snow shovel to make a flat platform for our tent, but since nobody was staying at Glacier Meadows, we pitched out tent right on the front porch of the Ranger's yurt. It nearly covered the entire porch. After setting up camp, we went to a nearby snow slope. I wanted to make sure that the z-pulley procedure for crevasse rescue was fresh in everyone's mind, including myself. Ascending Snow Dome Mount Mercury We set our alarm for 4am, hoping to get moving by 5. The next morning we tried to avoid the cold with some of Dave's instant coffee. It was great stuff but it triggered some necessary delays and we didn't get moving until 5:30. We made an ascending traverse to an avalanche chute where we turned straight uphill. Then we pushed through some trees to a point where we could see the glacial moraine. I was excited at this point because I knew that from the top of that moraine, I would have my first up close view of the Blue Glacier and Olympus. It was an amazing sight! But we could not see the west summit, as it was hidden by the formation known as Snow Dome. From the top of the moraine it was difficult to find a good place to descend to the glacier. One ranger had warned us that for many people, this is the hardest part of the route. The rocky slope is very steep and every part of it which is disturbed, gives way and falls downhill. Footing on that slope was tricky and good handholds were nonexistent. The Summit Ridge Fourth Of July Route When we reached the glacier, we ditched our trekking poles and donned our harnesses. After double-checking each other's prussik loops, rope knots, personal anchors and waist straps, we set off across the Blue Glacier. We passed over a number of trivial crevasses, most of which were only just starting to open up for the season. Many were only visible as small cracks about an inch wide. On our left, Mount Mathias and Mount Mercury towered thousands of feet overhead. In front of us we could see part of the East Summit. To our right was our next objective, Snow Dome. Ascending Snow Dome allows access to the upper glacier, bypassing the dangerous icefalls and serac mayhem. Near the top of Snow Dome, the views to the north and east really started opening up. The views of the Bailey Range were exceptional and Mount Mercury made a dramatic backdrop for some photos. Redwic Crossing The Bergschrund We turned southwest and headed straight for the west summit spire which was now in view, standing high above the glacier. We were following the tracks of a 3 person team that had summited two days prior. They were the first successful team this year. We hoped to be the second. They had taken the ""4th of July"" route which is the most direct route. This route is rarely climbed in the summer, due to the fact that it has several gigantic bergschrunds that open up fairly early in the season. We could not tell from our vantage point what condition they were in. The standard route traverses around a grouping known as ""The 5 Fingers"" and then goes over the false summit. Going that way would add at least an hour each way. Nearing The Summit Block We made our way up the steep snow slope passing by the end of several of the schrunds. We crossed one snow bridge and the view down inside the chasm to my left was disheartening. Near the saddle between the west summit and false summit we came to the last bergschrund, which the previous party had warned us about. They said, ""It's kind of like a big step, but it depends on what you're comfortable with"". It looked as if it had melted out even more since they had been here. I could see a spot where it was filled in with snow, but I knew better than to trust what looked like solid ground. If the filler snow was soft, there might be nothing underneath but empty space. On the other hand, without this spot as a crossing, there was no way to proceed with our chosen route. Summit Block, East Face I asked Dave and Craig to straighten out the rope and take all the slack out of it. I told them to be prepared to arrest if I should fall in. I probed the snow and then took a step of faith. It held. The upper lip of the bergschrund was about 8 feet high and part of it was overhanging. I had never tried to climb overhanging snow before, but I found that if I placed my axe in at an angle, as high on the lip as possible, I could create enough leverage to pull myself up, using the front points of my crampons to kick into the overhang. After some struggling, this technique worked and I was on the other side. Dave's turn was next and then Craig. We were very cautious as each person crossed, already partially in arrest position should anything happen. Redwic Crossing The Moat At the saddle, Dave assessed the summit rocks. The standard route climbs the east side, which is covered with loose, crumbly rock. Dave said he thought the north ridge looked more solid and Craig confirmed that this is what his research had suggested. We climbed a short 60-degree snow slope up to the base of the north ridge. At Dave's suggestion, I made a belay station in the snow using two axes for anchors. I had led on the glacier, but this was Dave's area of expertise and now it was important to follow his directions. The problem here was that a nasty moat had began melting away from the base of the rocks. Down inside was an unwelcoming fall into ice on all sides. Dave said he thought we would have to do the rotten east side after all, but I encouraged him to try to get across the moat. After struggling for awhile, he made his way across a very thin snow bridge that didn't look like it should hold any weight at all. Once he placed the first cam I breathed a sigh of relief. He was now in his element. As he climbed, he placed several more cams and finally a nut. Near the top, what appeared from below to be the easiest part, in fact turned out to be more difficult. He was not able to protect that portion of the climb. On Top Of The North Ridge When he reached the crest of the ridge, he set up a belay station and I followed his route, cleaning as I went. When I was up, Craig followed. Apparently the thin snow bridge had had enough of our nonsense because it collapsed under Craig just as he reached the far side. Craig made quick work of the rock and even dodged a falling rock that was triggered by the rope. When we were all on top of the north ridge, we scrambled up to the summit. Not a cloud in the sky! What an awesome day. We could see the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Pacific Ocean. We could see Mount Baker, Mount Rainier, and Mount Saint Helens, and all round us were Olympic peaks. We spent 15 minutes on the summit. Back at the belay station we took turns rappelling. I went first. It was kind of a trick to get across the moat now that the snow bridge was destroyed, but we managed. The Summit After roping up, we retraced our route past the bergschrunds, upper Blue, Snow Dome, lower Blue, moraine, and avalanche chute back to camp. We packed up as quickly as possible hoping to make some progress before sunset. We made it as far as the High Hoh Bridge, which left only 13.5 miles for the following day. It was a wonderful evening, camping in solitude with two friends in the wilderness after a successful day of climbing. I must say that achieving a tough goal somehow makes dehydrated food taste gourmet. By the time I finished brushing my teeth and got in the tent, Craig and Dave were both fast asleep. 360° View From The Summit Full Size (click again on next page) The next day we passed the Olympus Guard Station, 9.2 miles from the trail head, and informed them that Olympus now had two successful ascents for 2011. We told them that we had climbed the ""4th of July"" route on the 5th of July. Furthermore, because of worsening bergschrunds and moats, we explained that the route would be impassable by now. One Ranger shook his head as if we had taken an unnecessary risk. The other rangers looked impressed. They asked us not to tell any other climbers about it if we ran into them on the trail, so that no one would be tempted to follow in our footsteps.

I bet you are glad that I insisted on taking the entire week off from work. We actually did the trip sooner than originally anticipated. We originally were thinking about making an attempt later during that week, which we discovered after our trip had horrible weather and conditions. Many potential summit teams fail because they do not allow enough ""wiggle room"" time-wise just in case of bad weather. Besides, you still got to help out your boss later in the week, anyway. ;-) Side-Note: Yes, the rangers did not want us to tell other potential summiters that we used the ""Fourth of July"" route. However, I had the opposite theory. I made certain to tell several other potential summiters that we passed, as well as rangers, to *not* follow the footsteps on the mountain. If I had not done that, then other teams likely would have followed the footsteps thinking that was the best route. With only two successful summit teams (ours and the one two days prior), I did not want other people to follow the same route with worsening conditions and fail (or get into unseen risks). Telling others that advice seemed to be the right thing to do. gimpilator - Aug 3, 2011 12:24 am - Hasn't voted Re: Great TR... It sure was a great trip. I'm glad we could do it together.

single-day,"Old Goats Scramble North Twin Sister
North Twin Sister West Ridge Trip Report: North Twin Sister; west ridge on the right skyline On impulse I looked down and there before me on bended knee were 200 ravishing, gorgeous females! No sorry, that’s wrong. I meant ravenous and gorging. The bent knees were mine and the females were of the blood-sucking gender of the genus Anopheles clustered thickly on each kneecap where the fabric of my pants was stretched tightest and thinnest thus enabling the easiest route to their supper. But, hey, at my age, you take female attention where you can get it right? This all took place at a camp that Don (74), Tony (65) and I, Martin (the baby at 60) had placed at the top of the highest road giving access to the west ridge of North Twin Sister, our objective for the following morning. We had left Victoria, BC on the 9 am ferry earlier that day, had endured the now normal but fortunately brief encounter with US border paranoia and arrived at the gated bridge over the Nooksack Middle Fork at exactly 1.10 pm. Judging by the number and type of vehicles parked there, there were obviously quite a few people making the more usual bike-approach day-trip out of the climb than planning an overnighter. None of us creakier types much fancied pushing heavy bikes up 850 vertical metres of logging road, so we had opted to haul even heavier packs up there instead. I’m still not sure if this was the right decision and it’s too late now anyway. For the most part the roads are in very good shape and all you have to do is put your head down, your brain in neutral and grunt away steadily for 4 hours or so. The only distraction of note that I can remember was fording the Galbraith River at 3.30 and at an elevation of 880 metres. The approach directions Tony had printed out from Matt Gunn’s “Scrambles in Southwest British Columbia” (I love the way Matt has annexed Washington) were impeccable and without putting a foot wrong, 5.30 pm saw us at the bottom of the trail that leads through recent new growth, nice open old growth and finally onto the west ridge itself. The afternoon had been clear and hot and after pitching camp all we really wanted to do was drink, drink and drink some more. Having re-hydrated we finally did feel more like supper and eventually got round to fueling up for the next day’s effort. Mosquito heaven below North Twin If anyone is planning on camping at this spot note that unless there’s snow on the ground the nearest water is 5 minutes back down the road you came up on at the last switchback that turns right. Fill up here before carrying on to camp where we did. Or, for the sake of 5 minutes, put your tent up right by the road. There’s no-one coming this way but folk mountain biking down the road and they’re all long gone by 6 pm or so. By 8 pm we’d eaten, cleared away, organised packs for the morning, fed the dense clouds of mosquitoes many times over and were pretty well driven into the blessed relief of the tents by 8.30. The night was warm and I didn’t even get into my sleeping bag until the early hours of the following morning. As usual before a climb, I slept fitfully and was already up when my alarm went off at 5 am the next day. After the usual morning ablutions and oblations to the local mountain gods – and giving the mozzies their breakfast of course - we were off up the trail in smart order at 6.10 am.   Base of the west ridge  Lower west ridge. It takes only about 45 minutes of easy walking before the ridge narrows, the first easy scrambling starts and its time to put the pole away and the helmet on. The route goes very gently at first at barely Class 2 but then Class 3 passages begin to present themselves more frequently and of longer duration. By the time the “obelisk” was reached at about 8 am, the ridge is solid Class 3 climbing and you’re beginning to wonder if that last 20 metres or so wouldn’t have been more accurately described as easy 4th. Eschewing MountaingirlBC’s and others’ heroics on the obelisk as the domain of those who have not yet discovered the meaning of mortality, we down-climbed a little to the right and made progress up towards the false summit mostly on this side of the ridge crest.  West ridge above the obelisk A few false leads followed to be sure but, as all the books say, the olivine rock makes you feel like Spiderman and a huge hold presents itself almost every time you need one. I can only remember once stepping up to find I had to use a crimper for my next handhold rather than a huge velcro jug. Not bad at all in 800 metres of vertical gain. Once the base of the false summit was reached we down-climbed a bit to the right – following Becky’s route now rather than Gunn’s - until we could see the “comb” above us on the skyline. This a distinctive set of rooster’s comb-like pinnacles on the ridgeline approximately midway between the false and main summits. We then traversed to the right to a chossy gully directly below an obvious notch in the ridge to climber’s right of the comb. Rather than the gully we went up Class 4 slabs and blocky faces to its left and arrived in the target notch little more ten minutes later. Upper west ridge approaching the notch From the notch we squeezed through a narrow cleft that gave easy access to the ridge once again, walked across a flat snowfield and then up to a small sub-summit from which the main summit was in full view.  The snow saddle just below the summit. From this point it was only a matter of walking down a gentle snow slope to the narrow snow saddle above the north face and a further minute of easy Class 3 to the top of North Twin. We summited at 10.55 precisely. Approaching the summit of North Twin Now began the summit photo ritual. The only problem is that there’s barely room for 3 people up there and stepping back sufficiently to get subject plus Baker or South Twin in shot results in becoming gravitationally challenged in short order, followed quite soon thereafter by death. So we made do with close ups of two days of stubble and maybe-that’s-Baker-peeping-over-his-shoulder stuff before returning to the snow saddle at the top of the north face for real photos and lunch. South Twin from the summit of North Twin Mt Baker from the summit of North Twin It’s hard to wax eloquent enough about the views, at least on the day we climbed North Twin. Perhaps it was a little too hot to deliver the right clarity for that perfect photo but who cares. It felt like you could almost reach out and touch Baker and in spite of the haze, we could still see as far as Rainier. Contemplating the descent. Downclimbing the north face The north face is steep. We set off down it at 10 minute intervals at about 11.30. Tony first, then Don, and then me. We all faced in for at least the first 150 vertical metres. Judging by the angle of my axe relative to the snow, I would estimate the slope to be at least 60° and maybe even more right where you drop off the saddle. Take this bit seriously! Don’t start to glissade too soon – or at all. I did and, to my shame, lost control. All ended well but let me just say thanks to “Dave” in the group that followed us down and retrieved the bits that fell off! Traversing back under the NW face Once the initial steep bit was behind us the return to camp became a pleasant walk traversing under the NW face to intersect the west ridge just before the point where we had put the poles away that morning. We arrived back at the tents at 2.15, a quick brew, pack up (why is one’s pack always heavier and fuller on the way out?) and we were heading down about 3.15. Just over two and a half hours of I-don’t-think-my-knees-were-made-to-do-this later and the Nooksack hove once more into view. The long road home. Thanks to my patented (and highly secret) border approach methodology, we negotiated a more than half-mile long traffic queue at Customs in just under 15 minutes and made the 9 pm sailing with ease. We got our $17 worth out of BC Ferries “Pacific Buffet” that night I can tell you. A few notes about gear. We carried a rope and some rock pro but never got anything out of the packs. We also schlepped crampons and a couple of pickets up to our camp but, based on the reports of people coming down and the temperatures during the night, left all that at the tents. Axes, however, were essential to downclimb the north face. Work gloves for the west ridge save cuts and scrapes on the super abrasive rock and make the climb that much more pleasant. Many thanks to Don and Tony. Great companions both and a privilege to share this experience with. Thanks a million guys!

single-day,"Going for the Gold
After having a few mountaineering attempts that week I decided it was time to stay low in the mountains, with a clear day I figured Gold Mountain would be a good choice. Fortunately I was right on this call, although sadly we did not make the summit. I took the bus to Arlington which Chris then drove us to Darrington which is right next to Gold Mountain. The road started off with semi deep snow (certainly too much for my mom's car). As we got higher up on the road the snow got deeper which at times we started loosing speed. Chris was persistent with wanting to get as far up the road as possible. Pretty soon there was a tree in the road which I figured would be the end of the line. Nope, sure enough Chris pulls out his chain saw and has me depressurize the tires so that going through the snow is better. Prairie Mountain from the Road Fallen Over Tree Prairie Mountain Panorama After this we came across more trees which Chris sawed away, on the last fallen over tree the chain saw nearly ran out of gas but we got lucky and got though. Later on we got caught in some deep snow which Chris once again was persistent to drive up, so he would back up and ram in 6 or so inches, go back and ram the snow again. The only other person I could think of with that much persistence with driving up is my dad. Eventually we managed to make it though. I can guarantee that most people's car's would not have made it. Eventually when snow got to around 2.5-3 feet deep we finally had to start the walking. Illbiot Peaks Looking Towards Darrington After all the previous trips breaking trail was tiresome for even a flat road. All the fresh snow made all the difference in the world with difficulty. After a ways we decided to skip a few switch backs which had a few tough spots because we had to take off our snowshoes. Soon it was back to the road again. I'll admit after a while of trail breaking part of me wanted to not push on so hard, but I knew if I didn't there would be no way we would summit. When ever Chris would lead walking behind his steps was like resting, sometimes what I would do is have him break trail for a few minutes and then I would be able to for a while. Trees on Prairie Mountain Mount Baker Animal Tracks The atmosphere of the place never got above freezing and we rarely saw the sun. For most of the day we had little views due to tree cover and such. But after passing around a corner we were finally rewarded, which made the whole things certainly worth while. Sloan Peak's North West Face A Big Cliff in the Mountain Loop Highway White Chuck Mountain with Clouds Shadows over Mount Pugh Mount Shuksan and Sauk Panorama Jumbo Mountain Mount Pugh Clearing Up Alpenglow on Illbiot Peaks Alpenglow on Prairie Mountain Alpenglow on White Chuck Mountain A Nice Evening After taking tons of photos it was 4:24 p.m. which we had to get down. We came very close to the height of the summit. On the way down we had some nice conversations, the sunset was quite nice which White Chuck Mountain which had been buried by clouds most of the day made a good appearance. Travel back down to the car was much easier. Chris drove me to Smokey Point which was out of his way, but was much appreciated. From here I took a few buses down to Lynnwood. It was another great and beautiful day to be out in the mountains.

multi-day,"Fathers Day on Mt Adams
Hey Dad, Happy Fathers DayAt the summit of Mt Adams a slender hand comes out of its mitten and I hear “Happy Fathers day, Dad!” It is my 16 year old son, Tanner, who likes winter mountaineering as much as I do. He is on his High School snowboard team, so where there is snow, that’s where he is likely to be. Dad, I am so excited, lets go! So the snowboard is coming, right? Ten extra pounds on his pack and of course, he is willing to endure that. You don’t know how many times we got bonked on the head by his snowboard on the way up. It did make a fine cook table at the Lunch Counter. Our crew includes two other dads, two of my dearest friends. Day One Trailhead for the #183 South SpurThe day started off at the Cold Springs campground, where our first glimpse of fun was a very neat little grey fox scavenging around a campsite. We snapped a couple shots of him and we hit the #183 trailhead, then we were on our way. Chewin up the #183 We slogged up to the Lunch Counter (Suksdorf Ridge) where we busted out our tents and make camp. Before we got the water boiling, we noticed a goat across the snowfield on some rock. A mountain goat on Adams? Local Resident I thought goats didn’t like crowds. After Tanner ate 1.5 mountain house meals, we went to explore. My buddy Matt got within about 40 feet of this guy and we got some great pictures. A great way to end day one with the sun going down over the LC, just an amazing place to be. Sun setting at the Lunch Counter (Suksdorf Ridge) Day TwoSure is a lot of snoring going on at 7:00 am. Its Fathers day—where’s my breakfast in bed? Oh right, I am in a tent @9200 ft and only one of my children is with me and he is not getting up to make me breakfast. So I made him Backpacker Pantry Biscuits and Gravy. Time to get everybody up and get ready for our summit push. We got no sleep on Friday, so we all agreed the night before to sleep in a little. At 8:00am we push off for Piker’s Peak. 30 degree snow climb? Huh. I didn’t take the time to measure, but it was steeper than 30 deg. Cowsface on day one on the South Spur It is not dangerous, but steep. We got up to Piker’s, took a long rest and started the trek to the summit. 400 feet below the summit of Mt Adams On the summit somebody left the freezer door open as the winds kicked up and the temperature dropped way down. We put our glissade pants on here (I don’t know why we didn’t wait until Piker’s) and trekked back to Piker’s Peak where my son picked up his cached snowboard, then everyone took off for the 2200ft fun time. I haven’t glissaded in years and am real rusty, not to mention I would be a like a freight train out of control and might hurt someone if I got too much speed going. Very happy group of summiteers, ""splattski"" style summit photo So I invented a new technique. I call it Gliss-SLEDING. That’s where you plow down the mountain much like a glissade but end up with a 300lb snow ball between your knees and your butt crack. Refreshing! Hey, what are those fast moving clouds and wind coming from? Hurry, pack up camp and our packs and let’s get out of here. Packed up in 30 minutes and we started glissading on our fannies, feet, plunge stepping, and sprinting for the Cold Springs Campground. It took us 50 minutes with a couple of five-minute breaks. We arrived just in time for the ice, hail and snow to start beating us in the face and vroom—we were outta there. Did I mention I forgot to call my wife this day? I had cell service for most of it and just couldn’t find the right time. So back home, she was planning funerals, but wanted me alive so she could kill me again (for dying or not calling). Despite the population on Mt Adams and the 400 mile approach from Boise Idaho, this was one of the greatest experiences I have had in many years. I have no regrets (well—besides not calling my wife or having her on the mountain with me). I was with my two dearest friends and my oldest son who was able to greet me with a “Happy Fathers Day” on the summit of Mt Adams. Rock On!

multi-day,"The Picket Range Expedition
The PicketsI slowly pulled myself forward though the thick brush with twigs still caught in between my 65-pound pack and my body. I struggled to free myself and press uphill. It was two steps up the hill and one step back because of the muddy ground sliding beneath my feet. Every branch that I fought through was wet and the rain made it that much more miserable. It is one thing to be hit in the face with a branch but it is quite another when its soaking wet. It was as if I was being slapped with a wet sock, over and over again. I was climbing up the approach to the Eliey Wiley ridge on day 2 of my 8-day expedition into the Picket range. It was a rude awakening when I realized what this mountain range actually included. The trip had not been presented to me as a bushwhack through the rainforest while being rained on and then endless climbing on loose boulder fields. I felt like I was trying to climb 50,000 bowling balls stack up on top of each other. But it didn’t matter; we were already 17 miles and a boat ride away from civilization. I had no choice but to press on. The BushwackWe started out on the first day of the trip with a boat ride 6 miles down Ross Lake to Big Beaver pass where we said goodbye to civilization. My guide and I were stuck for the next 8 days in the wilderness with no quick or easy way back. As we started our journey, I realized we would be fine with heavy 65-pound pack. We had packed enough food I was sure. We hiked 10 miles on a trail to Luna camp and then another 7 miles the next morning until the bushwhacking began at Eliey Wiley ridge. I found myself during the first few hours of battling the brush taking five steps forward and either falling/sliding down the muddy terrain or taking 4 steps back. It was almost as if the Pickets were playing a cruel joke on me. I would take three or four tries to step up and over a fallen tree uphill from me. Or I would get caught in a thick slide alder, a weed-like tree with thick branches that refuse to let you through without a fight. Going downhill, these alder trees have slick branches that grow along the ground making it slippery and causing you to fall. Eliey Wiley RidgeWe also faced Devils club, aka the guardian of the Pickets. Devils club is a thorny plant that grows in wet areas and has thousands of sharp thorns on each plant. They grow close together making it difficult to cross without pain and being poked many times. These are some of the hazards of getting into the Picket range. Once on top of the Eliey Wiley ridge, we set up camp. The problem we ran into was none of the snowfields had running water coming out of them. They were all dried up. We knew it was a long way to the next water source. So we took out our ice axes and started hacking away at the downhill edge of the snowfield. After a few minutes of hard work, it had released enough water to allow us to rehydrate and have enough for cooking that night. The next morning we headed out and traveled on the side of the ridge. This involved a pile of very loose rock leading to unstable footing and several falls. The problem was, once I got a 60-pound pack moving in the wrong direction, I could not stop the momentum, which was caused by loose rocks shifting under my feet. I ended the day with multiple bleeding wounds on my arms and gruesome bruises on my legs. We pushed on the next day toward our first objective, Mount Challenger. We decided to stop at Wiley Lake. Mount ChallengerWilley Lake is a natural campsite with stunning views of the lake. The lake is surrounded by huge ice cliffs on two sides and has an ice bottom. Moving on the next day, we made it to the base of Mount challenger by mid morning. We setup our camp for that night and set off to climb the peak. The Challenger glacier was not broken up much and was an easy climb. We got up to the Bergshrund in about 2 hours. The normal route was not crossable due to the melt out. A schrund is a large several hundred feet deep crevasse that looks as though it has no bottom. We had to improvise if we wanted any chance to summit. We spotted a 55-60 degree snow climb on an exposed ridge to the far left. As we headed there, we found a natural route to the summit. We climbed and tried not to look at the 1500 foot drop offs to either side of us as we climbed. From the top of this, it was an easy 30-minute traverse across a snow ridge to the summit pyramid. The climb is about 5.3 but it feels much harder if you are wearing mountaineering boots. I had double plastic boots on so I could not foot jam. Therefore, it was all arms. I pulled myself the final 80 feet to the summit, which is a bird’s nest type of feeling. It is a little spot big enough only for two people to sit on but the views of the virgin untouched wilderness are stunning and unmatched in the cascades. After repelling down the summit pyramid and down climbing the steep snow ridge, we headed back to camp. Lousy LakeOn the fifth day, we headed out from camp for a huge 10-hour push with full loads to Lousy Lake. We setup camp on a rock island about 30 ft into the lake, which contented spectacular views of the surrounding peaks. Louise Lake is a glacial lake that had a huge glacier on one side and a rock/ice plug on the other side holding the water in. It had deep, algae, green colored water due to the glacial sediments. Even with this color, the water was very pure, clean, and great for drinking. That night there was constant rock fall off the glacier into the lake. We looked at the wall of the glacier on the edge of the lake and noticed it was separated from the rest of the glacier, tilting towards the lake. We even joked about the possibility of the wall falling into the lake causing a tsunami, which would blast us off the island we were on into the rocks on the edge of the lake. Well, soon thereafter, we heard loud cracking that went on for about 15 seconds. We got out of our tent and looked just in time to see the ice wall fall into the lake. We stood stunned, unable to do anything but wait and see what would happen next. We watched as a huge wave formed. However, lucky for us, we found out later the lake is only about 10-20 feet deep and the impending wave of doom ended up 2 feet below our tent platform. It was a scary sight to see and we were thankful it did not turn out worse. Mount Fury The following day we headed back toward Mount Fury to attempt the northwest face, which was not in the greatest condition. It was stained by rock fall on the left side of the route. We had hopes to find a route up the right side of the lower portion of Fury’s NW face then cross the rock fall area quickly to minimize the risk. In hindsight, this was a not great plan but we thought we would try it. The closer we got to the route, the more we could see what terrible shape the route was in. We started climbing the steep snow and ice up, about half way to the top of the rock fall area (shown in the photo). There were boulders twice the size of cars coming down the far side of the route. The final factor that led us to turn around was a huge ice serac the size of a house came crashing down the west side of the face. It shook the earth so much it made one of my ice axes pop out of the ice. This is quite a scary feeling when you are two-tool ice climbing up a 60-degree face. We decided to turn around after this as the objective danger was off the charts. We then, as quickly as possible, repealed down the face keeping an eye at all times on the ice cliffs above. We got back to camp very thankful that any rocks or large ice chunks did not hit us. Luna PeakWe headed up Luna Peak, to the saddle, the next day where we were going to camp and attempt Luna the following day. It was a difficult day since I had torn up my feet the day before. My wet feet never really dried the whole trip because of all the rain. I had large, deep, open sores on my feet that made me limp slightly in pain with every step. We made it to the saddle about 4 pm and enjoyed the views of the Southern Pickets and the rest of the Northern Picket range. We had an alpine start to attempt Luna but we ended up calling off our summit about half way up because of my feet. We headed back down to camp, packed up, and head down through access creek for another full day of bushwhacking. We enjoyed the pleasures of slide alder, devils’ club, fighting wet brush out of our way, and balancing on slippery logs across rivers. We down climbed and hiked for about 10 hours until we finally reached Beaver creek. We had a 2-foot wide tree that had fallen across this fast flowing creek about 100 feet wide. It would be very bad to fall at this point. The risk of drowning was very real. I slowly shuffled my way across the creek and made it across. I was greeted by a 200-yard field of devils’ club and then I was back on the trail, 1 mile away from Luna camp. The Home StreachWe arrived at Luna camp and I was very happy to be there. Having dealt with rain all day and being soaked after falling into a smaller stream we had crossed early that day, I was ready for a break. That day left my feet sloshing in 3 inches of water inside my boots. To make it worse, the sores on me feet had gotten much worse making it almost impossible to walk without a limp. Back at Lousy Lake, we were able to tape my feet to my insoles to limit the movement of my foot inside my boot. This helped a little but the pain was still horrible. It made me almost a cripple around camp without my boots on for protection. Tasks like getting water and going to the bathroom were huge ordeals since they involved putting pressure on my torn up feet. This was not the end of the trip though. We still had 10 more miles or so of hiking on Luna trail to the boat dock the next morning. The next day was full of pain and agony in my feet. Every step hurt but was made even worse by the pressure of my heavy pack. I reached the dock about 1pm. I could not believe I had made it. Just days before, I never thought I would make it to the dock. We caught a 2-hour nap while we waited for our water taxi. The final test of stamina was, once back at Ross lake resort, we had one final mile of uphill climbing to reach our car. It seemed like forever but I was very glad to see the parking lot. We made it back to the car safely. [img:334318:aligncenter:medium:] SummaryAs an entire expedition, I would consider the Pickets successful. They are a special place for me. They are where I learned what real mental toughness is. I learned about planning expeditions, a lot of wilderness navigation and how to analyze objective hazards. This mountain range charges a high rent… payable in sweat, blood, and tears. The reward is worth it all, a spectacular experience of a hidden treasure and beauty in northern Washington. While I did not have the best experience in the Pickets, it was priceless. Maybe someday I will get back there, back to the land guarded by alder, devils’ club, and miles of despair and agony.

Your story makes me want to pick up that pack and ice axe and head north. From my wanderings in the North Cascades I prefer approaching the Pickets from Sourdough Ridge in the south and down to Luna Lake. Too bad you didn't make it up to the top of Luna. The views from Luna Peak, Jack Mountain or Crater Mountain are considered the best in the Ross Lake area because they are isolated from the mountains around them. There is one bushwack in the North Cascades to avoid at all costs. Goodell Creek to Newhalen from the Mt. Truimph area is a terror. Two of my climbing companions made the mistake of taking the ""short cut"" out of the area and spent three days wading in ice cold water, fighting through vine maple, devils club, and nearly drowning forcing a crossing of the creek in July runoff.

Murph1 - Nov 10, 2007 12:51 am - Hasn't voted Lousy Lake My take on the name comes from the fact that those first climbers in the area in the 1950's found there is no good campsite near it.

single-day,"Mount Thomson East Ridge Solo
Love at First Sight Mount ThomsonSo one day I was having lunch with some friends when -bam!- there she was! The most gorgeous little thing I had seen in years, her beauty was stunning. She really stood out from the crowd. I wanted to say something, but it was like my tongue was tripping over its own taste buds and all I could utter was “Wow!” It was love at first sight and I knew that we were meant to be together. No, I’m not talking about the first time I saw my wife, sorry sweetie, this here story is about Mount Thomson! The first time I saw Mount Thomson was on top of Kendall Peak. A friend of mine invited me along on a hike he was planning to the Kendall Katwalk. I’m not much into hikes without summits, so fortunately Kendall Peak summit is very close to the Kendall Katwalk and I was able to convince my friends to hit the summit while we were there. They agreed, although reluctantly. I was the first to the summit and was greeted by a most impressive view of Thomson. I instantly fell in love with the mountain. I loved its profile, its sheer ridges, and its vertical relief from the surrounding scenery. I knew I was going to find my way up to the summit sooner or later, and turns out it was sooner. Three weeks later I set off from my home town of Chehalis, WA at 5 am for the 2 hour drive to the trailhead. Kendall Peak Summit - First View of Mount Thomson To Bushwack or not to Bushwack?During my research for the trip I had read about a couple of shortcuts. The first involved taking the Commonwealth Basin Trail instead of the PCT for the first leg of the hike to save about a mile worth of trail. This was a no brainer since I had been on the Commonwealth Basin trail twice before and it’s a great trail even though it is “abandoned”. The second shortcut I was contemplating was a cross country route that involved some bushwacking but supposedly saved 2 miles. I had read several trip reports of people attempting this route without much success. Here are some excerpts: ”...The first shortcut follows Commonwealth trail and is nice but the second one is a complete bushwhack and not recommended. This shortcut not only did not save any time it also wasted us.” ”...There is no boot track heading down to the Commonwealth Creek. We bushwhacked up and climbers left and it was awful, dangerous bushwhacking and 4-5th class loose veggie cliffs before we finally got to the trail again.“ “...I took Alternate Shortcut 2 up to Kendall this past week. I am not sure if its really the much ""shorter"" in that it takes a while to bushwhack… I ended up up and down climbing to make my way around cliff bands.“ ”...After some more brush-battling when the talus slope petered out we ran into more snow covered slopes, and then after a short steep section we finally stepped onto the PCT. Great success! By this point we were about 6 hours into our adventure, and an aging hiker who passed by as we were regrouping on the trail told us that it had taken him just 4 hours on the PCT.” So did I listen to all this sage advice? Of course not… I took the bushwack route! I made quick time up the Commonwealth Basin trail, up to the PCT, and to the big switch back where the bushwack route starts. As I stared off into the brush I kept trying to convince myself that this was a good idea. Eventually I took the plunge and stepped off into the foliage. The going was slow and tedious, in fact it was miserable. About 10 minutes in I contemplated turning back and cancelling the trip all together but I pressed on. Tired of forcing my way through shrubs on steep sidehill, I decided to just head straight up the mountain. I had seen pictures of the west side of Kendall and I knew that eventually the terrain would open up. After another 10 minutes of plowing through bushes it opened up! Right into some cliffs! There was a nice looking class 3 gully across the way, but alas, it was blocked by a 30-50 foot ravine with no possible way to downclimb. Again I considered turning back and I was reminded of a quote from Jim Birdwell: “A sense of uncertainty that is potentially fatal is what makes climbing an adventure. Anything less is just working out.” I certainly felt the uncertainty part, although if I had actually though my life was at risk I would certainly have turned around. Instead I pressed on and up the mountain dealing with multiple route finding challenges up the class 3 rock and vegetation covered slopes. I would make my way left, back to the right, and back left again several times before the terrain became largely dirt and talus and shortly after I reached the trail! Start of the Bushwack Cliffs! Doh! Morning Sun on Red Mtn I was pretty excited to reach the trail again. The bushwack route had taken me about an hour and certainly was an adventure. I was happy I took the bushwack route, but in hind sight I doubt I would do it again. I hiked the PCT a short distance to the Kendall Katwalk where I took out my GPS and looked at my stats: 2 hours and 2.8 miles! It WAS a shortcut!!! I saved about 30 minutes and about 2.7 miles of trail. I was pretty happy about this, and my legs still felt fresh. From this point on I was feeling pretty good. The weather was perfect, mid to low 50’s with a slight breeze, sunny, and clear cloudless skies. Great weather for a hike. I recall a trip report by mvs commenting on how much he liked the trail from the Katwalk to Ridge Lake and I would agree, this section of trail is lovely! I was so happy gently floating down the trail towards bumble bee pass. This is what life is all about folks! Soon after I reached the sharp turn in the trail that marks the boot path up to bumble bee pass. The trail was steep and climbed up a couple hundred feet and upon reaching the pass the views of Mount Thomson and the basin below were stunning! As I reached the basin I noted a small trickle of a stream coming from some remaining snow in the basin and was grateful that I would have somewhere to fill up with water on the way back. I eyeballed out a route through the boulders up to the notch on the east ridge of Thomson and started the hike up. Mount Thomson from Bumble Bee Pass Fall Colors Along the Trail View from Thomson's Basin Wrong Class 4 Route Correct Class 4 Route Lost and Found Lost Water BottleIn my research for the hike I had read the climber’s log for Thomson here on SP. The latest entry was from Josh Lewis who stated “Did this one with Gimpilator. Sad to say I lost one of my water bottles on this one. This is certainly one of the better I-90 peaks.” Well, on my way across the base of the cliffs towards the notch I looked down about 30-40 feet and spotted a water bottle! The thing was pretty beat up and looked like it had taken quite the fall with nicks and scratches all over it. I thought “I wonder if this is Josh’s lost water bottle?” and tucked it away in my pack. After I got back I PMed him a picture of the water bottle and sure enough, it was the one that he had lost on the belay ledge near the summit! Crazy, huh! :) The SummitI continued up a steep boot path and reached the notch, then continued on more steep boot path towards the summit. After a few minutes of this I longed for some class 3 rock to scramble up as the steep class 2 boot path was getting annoying. Unfortunately there wasn’t much scrambling up until the last couple hundred feet. I made my way up some easy class 3 and was searching for the 20 foot section of class 4 I was expecting to find. I reached a wall and sure enough, a 20 foot section that looked class 4ish so I climbed up. It was fairly difficult and I had to be careful and remember my holds for the downclimb. Once I reached the top I was disappointed to find nothing but cliffs. I had climbed the wrong section of class 4! Oops. I carefully made my way back down and followed left around the base of the rocks where I found another 20 foot section of class 4. Not wanting to repeat my last mistake I continued left around this route where the terrain got seriously exposed and there was no obvious way up. I turned back and scrambled up the last section of class 4 I had seen and it turned out to be the right route. It wasn’t too difficult. More challenging than normal class 3 climbing but there was not much exposure at all or at least much less than I was expecting. After this a little more scrambling and I was at the summit! Overcoat, Chief, and Chimney Rock Summit Self Photo Chair and Kaleetan The summit was amazing! Perfectly clear skies and a light haze of smoke from the fires off to the east made for some great scenery. The views of Overcoat, Chimney Rock, and Lemah were amazing and I could see Rainier, Glacier, and Stuart off in the distance. Chair and Kaleetan peaks looked good from this vantage point too. I spent close to an hour on the summit having lunch and soaking in the scenery. It was one of the best summits of 2012 for me by far. I signed the summit register and made my way down. I had no trouble downclimbing the class 4 although I did have to do that section facing in. As I made my way down the boulder field I ran into another party of three older gentlemen on their way up. They were pleased to hear that I was able to make it without protection since they did not bring any rope. One of the men said he had climbed it as a teenager without problems. I wished them luck and we continued on past each other. I hope they were able to make it up and down safely. Mount Thomson Summit View Until We Meet AgainOn the way back I stopped and chatted with a few day hikers, one of which informed me that there was possibly a bear on the trail. Another woman she had talked to said she saw the bear, and there was some bear scat on the trail. Fortunately I did not run into the bear and several hikers I passed remarked that they were happy that I was not the bear when they heard me coming down the trail. I decided to take the PCT back to the car instead of repeating the bushwack shortcut. I had had enough adventure for one day. Turns out to be a good decision as the trail back was nice and relaxing and took me about 50 minutes to get back to the Commonwealth Basin trail. A short while later I was back to my car and heading home. The whole trip took me 8 ½ hours car to car and was one of the best trips of 2012. I was one happy guy.

single-day,"Not the Wright Mountain: An Avalanche Tale
Trip StatsMembers: Gimpilator, EastKing, FTZE, Josh, Gabe Equipment Used: Ice Axe, Snowshoes, Common Sense Equipment Nearly Used: Avalanche Beacon, Shovel, Sattelite Radio, New Pair of Clothes Not the Wright Mountain: An Avalanche Tale Introduction Rarely do I ever write about trips where there wasn't a successful summit involved. However, this trip up Wright Mountain was an eye opener and well worth writing about. Though the trip lasted maybe six hours, there was quite a strong potential for this trip to have ended much differently than it did. We all learned plenty of lessons on this trip and the trip made all of us stronger. The largest lesson from this trip report is to always be aware of everything around you, and don't always trust the avalanche forecast. Winter always has its surprises and today was a classic example of an avalanche surprise. Avalanche conditions were supposed to be low today but that didn’t quite turn out to be the case with the mountain that we picked. Wright Mountain was not the right mountain and luckily we found that out before something serious happened. I think all us of feel very glad that the outcome was so positive. Gimpilator, Josh, Gabe, FZTE, and I decided to take a shot at Wright Mountain, which in summer is a fairly easy 12 mile 3000 foot elevation gain mountain right from the Alpental Ski Area. In summer, this mountain can be done in four to five hours. There is a great boot path that goes right around Snow Lake and heads right up to Gem Lake. From there, it is just a minor scramble to the summit of Wright Mountain. As you will see here Wright Mountain takes on a different character in winter. The Beginning of the Trip The weather today was cold and dry but visibility was perfectly clear. There was not a cloud in the sky throughout the beginning of the trip and it looked like all the forecasters that had called for little avalanche danger were going to be right. The only clue that there was going to be issues was the heavy wind. It was blowing snow off some of the higher peak and depositing it down below. We started off in the Alpental Ski Area and decided to head up the Snow Lake Trail. The Snow Lake Trail was very well used and there was a clear path from the trailhead on the way up. The views from the trail were absolutely breathtaking and clearly some of my best photography was taken today. This first section was easygoing and most of our breaks were to take pictures of the mountains. The well-used path headed all the way to the view of Snow Lake. The beauty from this trail was unreal and the mountains were very pretty in their winter setting. On the way up there were not too many people on the trail. The First Hint It was easy hiking to the viewpoint of Snow Lake. However, getting down to Snow Lake was a little more interesting. We decided to check a couple of slopes and glissaded down to the base of Snow Lake. Once at the base of Snow Lake we could see Wright Mountain. Josh took lead on the glissade and headed down the slope with Gabe heading right behind him. They set a good glissade path on the way down so the rest of us followed. I was the last one but I noticed on the way down I picking up a lot snow below my feet on a well-worn glissade path. Gimpilator and I tested the snow just to check the quality out. The snow was not compact at all, which gave us the first hint that the snow wasn't as stable as we were lead to believe. Luckily, we did not head too much more downhill and since we were at the base of Snow Lake, we were home free!! Or so we thought.... It was tempting just to cross Snow Lake and get to Wright Mountain. But we didn’t trust that Snow Lake wasn't completely frozen over. Because of that judgment we decided to go around the lake on the east side to hit our vantage point. After the glissades there was at first a simple traverse along the side of the lake. This section eased our nerves and we were feeling confident again. The Crux Everything was going ok until we hit one tricky slope on our traverse. This 200 foot, 45-degree angle snow slope leads all the way to the frozen lake. What we didn't know was that this was one spot though where the snow must have blown off the lake and loaded this slope with snow. Gimpilator was looking at a traverse of a ridge when he noticed some cracks in the snow on the slope. He and Josh turned and headed down where me FZTE and Gabe were checking out the lower slopes. Noting that we decided to head closer to the lake where we would stay low to cross the section. At one point a number of us stepped on the lake and quickly got reminded that the lake was not completely frozen. Seeing the bubbles rising to the surface woke Gabe up and we knew that we were not even going to be anywhere near that lake. Figuring this was the crux we proceeded on and crossed the section on the safest section above the lake. Gimpilator took lead on this section and we all crossed the section one at a time. We stay about five to ten feet above the lake and kept our voices down through the section. It felt very scary walking between a frozen lake and a slope, which could possibly go at any time. However, we traversed through it and at this point we thought we were home free because all we had was a mile and a half left. So after crossing this section we headed up a slope to what we thought was a ridge. After crossing that slope we didn't want to be anywhere near the slope of the lake again. We aimrf for the highpoint of a ridge where we could possibly traverse it all the way to Wright Mountain. Unfortunately, once we hit that ridge we realized that we were going have to go down and then head back up. So from here we decided to head down at the lowest angle of slope. AVALANCHE!!! LET'S GET OUT OF HERE By now we were checking for potential avalanche areas. Gimpilator and Josh were heading down the slope to check for cracks when Josh spotted a major crack in the snow right below his feet. Gimpilator spotted it early and cautioned us all of us. Josh took one kick at the snow and there went any plans, desire or thought of continuing this trip anymore. At that very moment the snow raised and released a mini avalanche. The crack in the snow just rose up and then the entire slope just gave way. The section of the snow was 20 feet by 10 feet and to see it rise and then fall put fear into us. Luckily for all of us Josh was not taken from the avalanche and stayed above the falling snow. He was very fortunate to stay above the mini avalanche and though he was shaken, he was ok. Without any hesitation we turned back. That was all the warning signs we needed. We were still 1.5 miles from the summit and there was no reason to go further. To be honest, even if we were 100 feet from the summit we probably would have turned back. We headed back to the top of the ridge took a small break and then headed on out of there. There we got something to eat and relaxed our nerves a little before starting our return voyage. The Trip Back We decided to head back the way we came because that area we knew best and we were too spooked to go up any new slopes. The crossing of that one slope was tricky but we did it the same way we did on our way up. We also stayed on the same trails that we established in order to not hit any undisturbed areas. Heading up the glissade chutes we established was physically tough but it was much safer that attempting to climb a new undisturbed slope. This 50-degree slope was steep but it was disturbed and though the bottom was full of deep powder, the top of the slope was actually very stable for kick steps. All of us were slow on this section but we got through the section in good shape for the return trip back. Once on the top of ridge with the view of Snow Lake we knew we were home free. On the ridge though head back to Alpental there was actually a well-used glissade path that went down to the Snow Lake Trail. This was a quick fun ride down to the path. Some of us glissaded all the way down the safe slope while others just glissaded to the trail. On the way back down the Snow Lake trail was much more crowded. We all made a quick pace back to the car. Gabe likes to run down trails and this well used path was no exception. So he did his typical run down this slope while the rest of us did more of a fast paced walk. Soon we were back at the car where took a deep breath and a sigh of relief after witnessing that mini avalanche first hand. Conclusion Overall it was a good trip, but we were very fortunate with the outcome. It will go down on paper as an unsuccessful attempt on good weather. But this trip could have different. First, we will not ever trust the avalanche forecast ever again and err always on the side of caution. Second, I think we will stop on the first sign of poor conditions, not the second or third. That being said though it was a great trip and I hope we all combine again to do a ton of other mountains.

Snidely Whiplash - Jan 11, 2010 11:18 pm - Voted 10/10 You made the right call. Better not to risk it. Good trip report on a worthy winter objective. I realize that I wasn't there, but I wonder if your avalanche danger could have been further minimized by staying on the regular trail route. As I remember, it pretty much stays in trees the whole time up to Gem Lake, and then even past there up the ridge around Gem Lake to Wright Mountain. EastKing - Jan 11, 2010 11:31 pm - Hasn't voted Re: You made the right call. I think if we were higher up on the ridge that might have helped out a little but then again I'm not too sure. If you click on the picture that actually was the location of the trail (http://www.summitpost.org/image/542590/542583/the-trail-around-snow-lake.html). That part of Snow Lake actually side traverses those slopes. In summer they don't look bad. But in early winter when all it take is a minor avalanche to send you in to frozen water and break some bones the side traversing of Snow Lake can be dangerous. Gimpilator has a link to both on his page. I think I like to take a second crack at this one though in early spring when the snow has consolidated more. Viewing: 1-6 of 6 to post!

single-day,"Keepin it Gangsta on Philadelphia
Part 1: Checking out the Place Eastking and I have often seen Philadelphia Mountain on the way to much of our climbs along the highway 2 area. On April 3, 2011 we decided it was time to attempt it. We got to the trail head around 6 in the morning and were making good progress on the trail. I was pleased to see water falls along the way as well as dry trail until we got about halfway to Lake Serene. Bridel Veil Falls Multiple Falls After a ways of walking we got to the turn off for Philadelphia Mountain which follows a nice ridge to the summit. This is where we put on our snowshoes. The snow than began to fall, but we did not mind, although would have loved to get some views. After breaking trail a ways I get to a icy snow patch which looking behind me it was too late to turn around. I carefully took a few more steps almost topping out of the steep section and then this is where I slipped. I fell 40 or so feet down hill with little harm although it had snapped my snowshoes (still effects me to this day). I had to rig my snowshoes to just barely work. Eastking Heading Up Snow Cornice Although we were making decent time, not only had my snowshoe once again fallen apart (due to the strap snapping earlier) but Eastking's work schedule made time a pressing matter. Looking at the given circumstances we decided to head back down. We still had a fun trip. Forest View to the North Part 2: Keepin it Cool  Sunrise on the Monte Cristo Peaks  Mount ZekesAlmost a whole month later on May 1, 2011 we got another opportunity for this mountain. A week earlier we had attempted this trip, drove to the trailhead but was turned back due to heavy down pour and viewless conditions. But this time, we got what we wanted. Sometimes not making the summit is a good excuse to come back to the mountain with success in good weather. When arriving at the trailhead it was a clear sky which some of the stars could still be seen in the morning cool air. When hiking through the forest we could see Mount Index and Mount Persis through the trees looking almost as if it were a peak from the Andes. Once the sun rose, there was enough lighting which I could start up my photography, which of course then means I also then end up having to run and catch up. Looking Below (North) Once we reached the snow the trail was nice and beaten in making traveling much nicer. I couldn't help but look in amazement at the flutings on Mount Index's impressive East Face. Once we got near the lake we put on our snowshoes and from here on out I broke trail until the summit. I wanted to make up for the last trip and be the breaker which now I had double jobs, the other one being the photographer. When ever I stopped I had to make sure I pushed on far enough so that I could pull my camera out of it's case, turn on the camera, take the photos, turn it off, and put it away. Video cameras in my opinion are a little harder to manage, which by the time I was done with this Michael would catch up and I would have to go back to trail breaking. One of Mount Index's Steep Gullies One of Mount Index's Many Edges Michael and Mount Index The Skykomish River Mount Index Panorama As we got near the summit I found some good view points through the trees which I was impressed, although a little off the main path.

The last minute of the trip I was dashing to the car, told Michael ""Quick! Quick, Eastking's coming and we got to go now!"" which we scrambled our stuff in and we drove out.

single-day,"An 18 Hour Day On Mount Baker
One Day Ascent via Easton Glacier Mount Baker Redwic and I wanted to climb Baker via the Easton Glacier. Prior to June we assembled a team of 8 climbers, all experienced and very strong. Unfortunately, a long period of bad weather in early June derailed our plans completely. We lost all of our team members. It was nearly impossible to find other glacier climbers who could be available on such short-notice. If the storm ever broke, we might only have one day to work with, rather than the standard two-day ascent. Could we travel the 16 miles and climb 7500 feet in a single day? Were we up to the challenge? Potential Hazards Of The Easton Glacier After another bad weekend (June 17,18) we noticed an upcoming weather window mid-week, just one day of clear skies, as we had suspected. Lucky for us, our supervisors at work were willing to cooperate. I contacted Joe (SP member Fjes6) and was happy to hear he had Wednesday off work. He asked if he could bring his friend Jeremy along. The four of us set off from the cars at 8pm Tuesday night. We carried no tents or sleeping bags, no room for error. Our intention was to climb Baker in one long push. I estimated that we would reach the summit around sunrise, or thereafter, and then get down below the glaciers before the snow bridges started softening. Before Dawn The first half-mile to the end of the road was still snowed in. Joe made a good recommendation for where we should cut up onto the Railroad Grade ridge. Part way up the ridge, the last light of day faded, and we switched to headlamps. We passed several groups of tents at the various camps and we later learned these were mostly students for the Alpine Ascents climbing course. Mountain Shadow We roped up at Sandy Camp. Redwic was in the back, ready to initiate Z-Pulley if needed, while Jeremy and Joe, were in the middle. We followed tracks to around 8000 feet. I felt bad for the previous climbers when I saw the tracks end at 8000 feet. Judging from the depth of the tracks, it had been raining when they were here. At 9500 Feet We passed by a couple small crevasses off to the side, but so far they few and far between. Perhaps with all the June precip, there was still too much snow to see the majority of them. I said, ""hey, maybe we won't see much in the way of crevasses"". Then I immediately wondered if I shouldn't have said that. The tracks ended at the base of a steep incline. I started leading up the slope until I heard a strange tinkling sound. I immediately froze in my tracks. Something in the back of my mind told me I had heard that noise before, and it was a bad thing. I took one more tentative step forward and then I could see it. I was on the very edge of a massive gaping maw, the largest I had ever been close to. Lincoln Peak Alpenglow The other side was at least 40 feet away. I couldn't see the bottom. The tinkling sound was caused by small icicles that were breaking off the underside of the lip. Someone down behind me asked ""how does it look?"". ""It looks like shit!"". They asked again, probably wondering if they had misheard me, and I said, ""It looks really bad"". I looked down at my feet and there was a large split in the snow that I hadn't seen at first. This whole lip could sheer off at any moment. I turned around and told the rope team that we needed to reverse direction. I told them to keep the slack out of the line. Redwic led the way back until we could try another way around the steep slope and giant crevasse. South Twin And North Twin We went to the right and passed between a series of very large crevasses. I wondered how Joe and Jeremy were feeling. This kind of thing can be pretty exciting/scary the first time. We continued to climb and had to cross over several smaller crevasses. Most of them were still covered enough that we could step from one lip to the other. Just after 4am there was enough natural light to see without headlamps. The crater was above us. We could see the gases pumping out and we could smell the sulfur on the wind. Volcanic Gas Above Alpenglow was now painting the peaks around us. The view of Lincoln and Colfax was especially good but we could also see the Twins, Glacier Peak, and Rainier very clearly. I was surprised about the lack of wind. We were over 9000 feet and the temperature was below freezing but very comfortable for climbing. At the rim of the crater we paused to absorb the ambiance while giant clouds of volcanic gas rose hundreds of feet above our heads. Sherman Crater Rim Beyond the crater we contoured the rocks and ascended far right of the Roman Wall. At this point I remembered my first ascent of Baker in 2006 and how the Roman wall had been icy and unsettling. But the snow conditions today were perfect, very firm but not the least bit icy. Sherman Crater We reached the summit around 8am. It was Jeremy and Joe's first volcano climb. A wonderful accomplishment! But this was also a historic moment for peakbagging in Washington State. At the summit Craig became the 10th person to complete the WA County High Points. But not only that. He also completed the WA County Prominence Peaks, the WA 25 Mile Isolation Peaks, and it was his 100th 2000 foot prominence peak. Pretty amazing if you think about it. I felt very proud of him and honored to be a part of this pivotal climb and several of the other challenging ones we had done together on those lists. I laughed out loud when he pulled out a bakers hat and put it on his head. Get it? A bakers hat on Baker. Steep Slope Above Sherman Crater We left the summit around 8:30am and followed our crampons tracks back down to where the deeper boot tracks were. The snow remained firm until that point but then it started softening up. Around 7500 feet we encountered some post-holing action which was discouraging now that the team was getting tired. At the camps we passed by several groups practicing various snow climbing and glacier travel techniques. It seemed a few of the new students looked at us longingly, jealously aware of what we had just done. Redwic The Baker Once we were off the glacier we untied from the rope. Joe and Jeremy went on ahead to meet us back at Joe's house to exchange gear. They were faster than us and we didn't want to hold them up. After a seemingly endless road walk, Redwic and I got back to the car around 2pm. It was hot and we were feeling exhausted after 18 hours of climbing. It was now approaching three full days without any sleep for me. Excitement and anticipation had kept me awake the night before this climb. On the way back to Mount Vernon I started hallucinating. I saw some very odd things on the side of the road. I stared at them hard, hoping that would make them go away, but they didn't disappear. I guess I was dreaming awake.   The Descent See also Redwic's trip report of this climb.

single-day,"The Battle to Summit North and Middle Chiwaukum
The Trip Report Introduction Well it was 10 pm on Saturday and everyone was wondering what mountain to do. We originally were looking at doing Eldorado due to a number of absolutely incredible trip reports coming from the summit, but with a recent storm that came through the area and dumped a foot of snow on the mountain and the avalanche danger raised to considerable, Eldorado was knocked off the list. So which peak should be do next. Well after a lot of debate we agreed upon Middle Chiwaukum. Josh, Mike and I were familiar with this summit three weeks before when we fell short of the summit Middle Chiwaukum and settled for Point 7132 (North Chiwaukum as I discovered later). From North Chiwaukum we just stared at the summit of Middle Chiwaukum and stared in the defeat of the mighty mountain. For us this was a rematch of the mountain. The Beginning On this trip it was Gimpilator, Josh, Mike, Robin and I. We arrived at the trailhead at 6:30 am after a hairy ride on an ice road to the trailhead. Thankful Robin's car had traction tires otherwise this trip in wouldn't stopped before it started. We got ourselves ready and hit the road early. It should be noted that the road walk up to main climb is around the same distance as the actually climb. However with very little elevation gain and loss this road walk often only take an hour to complete. It is basically a none issue but you do gets some good views of nearby mountains from this road. Once at the trailhead we saw the footprints that we made the last time and begun to head up the mountain. As stated from the last trip report this section was very icy and the micro spikes and crampons broke out early. They stayed on up the steeper section of the trail until about 4500 feet when the snow got thicker and much less icy. The slope though remained very steep and it took the total team this time to broke trail. It was Josh though who was the strongest, followed by Gimpilator and Mike here and broke the most trail but everyone helped brake the trail. By 6000 when we hit the ridge the snow was fairly deep in spots. Coming out on the ridge stellar views were wide open with Middle Chiwaukum showing up in view at 6200 feet. Decision Time We hit a bump just before North Chiwaukum and Gimpilator decided to check the snow here for avalanche issues. The test was not promising at all. The snow here was very avalanche prone. It was decision time right here and it was head straight to the summit of North Chiwaukum and revaluate or bag it right there. Gimpilator broke out his avalanche probe and his shovel and decide to give it to one of us and took lead on the trip. He headed up to Point 7130 only to find the snow to be much more stable. Robin a little scared of the situation decide to stay back with her down and her ten essentials and emergency gear. The rest of us followed Gimpilator only after checking with Robin to make sure she was 100%. It was on Point 7130 we discovered that the snow was substantially more firm and safer. From there we went across the wide ridge all along giving look at the grand summit of Middle Chiwaukum. The views were very breathtaking but to honest I tried to get them out of my mind and focus on the summit and the task at hand. Summit Bid Once we got shoulder of Middle Chiwaukum we took a look at the task at hand. Chiwaukum Ridge looked quiet intimidating from below. We changed into crampons here and decided to go for it! One thing I have learned over the years is that these final climbs often look more intimidating than they often are. I discovered this with Painted Mountain and I was hoping this was the case. Gimpilator though took it very slow up the ridge here and solved the puzzle of this ridge like a magician. Take one slow step at a time he broke it down. Once over that crux we were on an easier slow heading to the corniced summit. The Summit With couple steps we were on the true summit of Middle Chiwaukum. We looked for the summit log but could not find it due to the new snow that has fallen in the past week. None of us wanted to put too much effort because the summit was very close to a cornice with a mighty huge drop-off. Once top we enjoyed stellar views of hundreds of peaks including, Big Chiwaukum, Mount Daniel, and Mount Rainier. To be honest this view on this day had to be one of the best views I have ever seen. We didn't stick around long but for the time we were on top it was pure nirvana. It is times like this that all of us put the effort into climbing. A special thanks here to Gimpilator for being a strong leader and getting us safely to the top. Heading Down Getting to the top though is only half way. Now we have to head down the mountain and with the addition of Point 7130 that was nearly 6000 feet of elevation. We were tired but we knew the task at hand. It was now time to start our journey down the mountain. Getting down from the summit ridge was much easier than getting up. The ridge was easy enough so that we did not have to down climb it. We were still cautious on heading down from the summit but much more comfortable. We cruised to the base of 7130 but the small 300 foot climb to 7130 became very tiring most of us and it ate up a lot of energy. So once on top of Point 7130 we took yet another small 5 minute break to refuel. After that we headed down and picked up Robin who was comfortable looking at us from a viewpoint on the ridge. There we put on our snowshoes and cruised down the fresh snow slopes. It was very an enjoyable snowshoe decent until we got off the major ridgeline. The trip here was a little more slippery with powder slowly giving way to ice. We kept our snowshoes on to about 4500 feet but were falling all over the place until that point. It was hard to get much balance on the snow and often I was on my backside than on my feet. Even after 4500 when we bare booted down to 3900 feet I was using a ton of energy heading down this slope. Finally at 3900 feet out came back the crampons and heading down became MUCH EASIER. Josh stayed with me here and we kept the crampons on all the way to the bottom where it was now getting dark. For the road on the way back I decided on snowshoes. It was a warmer day and I had little strength at this point to be post holing on a road walk. Plus I figured I could gather a lot of speed here because the road a gentle grade. I think this was the correct call because Josh and I were able to race on back and almost catch up with the others. An added bonus is that it was a full moon and though I broke out my headlamp. The headlamps were not really needed. The Conclusion Once back at the car I realize I was very over exhausted. Though I ate and drank more than I ever had before I had use a lot of energy. Once in the car I refueled on electrolytes and snacks and took a large nap in the car back to my friends place. I was very overtired the next day but now am slowly getting myself back to form. That being said I want to thank everyone for coming today. Josh did some great trail breaking while Gimpilator took over and safely broke a route to the summit of Middle Chiwaukum. Robin did awesome too and we want to thank her for the ride and for coming out to give this peak a shot. Next time Chiwaukum will be yours!! Awesome work team and a great summit.

multi-day,"This is my America!
Introduction After climbing Mount Pugh I wondered to myself ""what do I want to do for my birthday?"". Of course what would any alpinist want to do for their birthday? Go for an epic adventure! For a long time I've wanted to bike to Sahale Mountain considering that it's one of my favorite mountains. The word Sahale is a Native American word meaning high place, which fits the description well. It's mountains like these that I consider to be the most beautiful of places in the world. The adventure consisted of about 40 miles of traveling, the first part would be biking from the road closure half way though the valley to the trailhead. After that then to the pass, up Sahale Arm, and to the summit and back. We had a limited budget on what we could bring for food so Michael and I rigged up 3 bean burritos, a some what filled jar of peanut butter, a small bottle of jelly, a half loaf of bread, and some granola bars which would serve as our food for the entire trip. If everything went according to plan, we would be back Sunday. Unfortunately the rope deal complicated the trip beginning, my friend Mark Straub let us borrow his rope which we then made our way for Sahale. Day 1: Riding though the Cascade Valley Cascade Valley Hidden Lake Peaks Summit Fallen over Trees Road Closure By the time we got to Cascade Valley the sun was already setting behind the ridge. We had to make good time if we were to make this a success. The bike ride though the valley was a decent challenge in itself. The fact that I was using a bike from the 1980's and had a heavy pack on made it more exciting. Around mile marker 12 was where the construction was taking place, the bridge was in good shape, but they were reinforcing it. Quite often the Cascade Valley has been known for washouts though out the years which this year was no exception to this. A mile later we had a nice down hill ride which meant we would have to go back up on the way back. As we went down another hill I looked up and Johannesburg Mountain looming above with clouds over it which was formidable looking. Once we arrived on the up hill part we pressed on up as much as we could and then walked the bikes. We repeated this for miles though the valley. We did not see another person until the end of the trip. I was a little worried about the thought as we kept going further and further into the mountains, but at the same time it was a comforting feeling to not have to deal with loud noises, to have quietness, and the whole place to ourselves. Eldorado Peak from the Valley As we biked through the woods the sun started to set and it started to get darker and darker. We could see mountains through the trees glowing bright red. One of the mountains I remember was sticking out, my beautiful Sahale! It was quite an amazing feeling being out in these woods in the Cascade Valley. Johannesburg from the Road Sahale during Sunset Alpenglow on Mount Torment Eventually we arrive at mile marker 21. We knew that the remaining road from here was steep so we stashed our hikes off to the side behind a log near an old abandoned cabin. After a little bit further we took a break to filter some water and enjoy the scenery. A mile later we arrived at the Cascade Pass trailhead. As we walked along I would watch as clouds would rise over Cascade Peak and the Triplets with a little moon light giving it a really nice atmosphere to the place. The stars also made for a great show, I felt like a pioneer the way that it looked, just me, my brother, and the mountains. Normally this would be an easy hike to the pass but the bike ride, climbing Mount Pugh, and the heavy pack took its toll on us. It was beginning to feel relentless switch backing through the woods. Later that night we found a good place to camp. I went to sleep fast, which was very solid that night and woke up a little after sunrise. Day 2: Going for SahaleWe had breakfast which was waffles and syrup. The weather was very nice looking outside although with a bit of winds. Along Sahale Arm we found a small pond which was a good spot to purify water. At first we were skeptical of using it because it was a bit green but it was good enough to use. Sahale Mountain in View Mount Baker far Away Filtering at a Pond Bird Flying Over Flowers with the Triplets After this we hiked on up Sahale Arm until we arrived at the Sahale Glacier. This is where things slowed down. Michael had a hard time putting on his crampons but eventually figured it out. We roped up, attached our prusiks and were ready to go. At first we were making good time up until the slope got steep. There were large crevasses almost completely splitting the glacier making it questionable whether we could even make it. We had to cross back and forth across the glacier to get past them. It was a very cool feeling to be leading my brother up the mountain, feeling some what like a guide. Michael on the Sahale Glacier The crevasses crossed each other which worried me, but to our luck we found a snow bridge that worked well. And who says the Sahale Glacier is not much of a glacier. After a few hundred feet of walking though snow we unroped and headed up the South West Ridge. It started out as a scramble through rocks which were loose as we went up. As we were scrambling on the ridge I got to a point were I did not feel comfortable and decided I would have to turn around and find another way. When I got down Michael said he was done, so the last part I had to solo. Even starting out was worry some for me, I had to be careful and hold on tight to the rock which was solid. Sahale's Summit Block Upper Southwest Ridge Looking towards Brooker Loose Rock Ahead Michael Scrambling Sahale's South West Ridge Forbidden, Torment, and Eldorado Peak As I pushed myself further and further up the face I was some how almost in some kind of trance, perhaps summit fever. It got to the point were it felt like class 4, crazy emotions started striking me. The moment got more and more intense with each step until I got on the summit ridge about 100 feet from the summit. It was one of the scariest spots I have ever touched (back in 2009), I only took one photo from this spot and carefully put my camera away. Normally I would not have even taken the one photograph but I some how felt compelled to do so, the moment was so beautiful and view was unique. I looked up at the summit which looked at least class 5, way to dangerous to approach, not only did the ridge look loose, but a huge cliff and glacier were below me, and I decided to call it quits here. Boston Peak looked even more intimidating, I did not stay on this spot long because of the dangers, after this trip I found out I was on the wrong ridge. Down climbing it was frightening, I had to be very careful. Finally when I got to the class 3 part I felt a lot better. Boston Peak's South Face Glacier Peak with a Blue Haze As I was heading down a safer route I looked back at the summit block at what could of been the right way to the summit which I believe goes a little around the east part. I decided against it because not only did it look a little iffy, I was solo, and the sun was going to set soon. Even though we spent a good effort trying to summit, I decided it was not worth the risks and that Sahale will be there some day, and besides a return trip when snow covered would be better. One of the Many Crevasses South East View Dome Peak Panorama Sahale View Panorama I return to Michael, we rope back up and tried to get down as fast as possible to avoid the glacier freezing over. Heading down was not too bad, the place was starting to get sunset colors, and soon we were off the glacier. We repacked our gear and made a hurry down, it began to get cold quick, especially with the winds. On the way down we came back to our pond to filter more water. It was partly frozen making the process less enjoyable. Filtering the water was extremely cold, my hands started to go numb fast. Sunset from the Upper Arm Yours Truly during Sunset Late in the Day Looking Down Sahale Alpenglow on Sahale Soon it became dark which we arrived at camp with the winds picking up. After eating and such we went to bed. As we were about to go to sleep we started seeing lighting up parts of the tent which frightened me at first because I had no idea what was going on. To our amazement the wind was creating static electricity which glows in the dark, but I was so tired that I soon fell asleep. Day 3: The Return back HomeWhen I woke up the sun was up which meant it was time to go and pack up our gear. We originally did not expect to stay a second night but considered it possible, so our food supply was short. I drank out of the jelly jar and ate strait up peanut butter. Johannesburg from Below Cascade Peak's North Face Sahale from the Valley Johannesburg's Summit Block Eating the Last of the Food Heading down was not as difficult as I had expected it to be, for the most part it was easy, although I had become quite thirsty by now due to the lack of water we had left. A ways down the road we hit the creek again and filtered some more water. By this point we were running down the road, although I had to stop because it became a bit much running down the steep road with heavy packs and being tired on a hot day. At least the conditions were nice. Walking the Bike though the Cascade Valley We soon got to our bikes near the cabin and started heading down. After a few miles we got to the down hill section which worried me due to the slope and turns, Michael was way ahead of me, and I did not slow down much because I did not want to fall behind. Later when we got to the bottom of the hill we took a break, Michael noticed the strange noise coming from the bike (this was the same bike I used on my Steven's Pass Attempt Trip which tends to get a lot of friction). Michael ""fixed it"" or at least for a little while, until the clicking came back, we swapped bikes which was so much easier on me when going up hill. ""And I thought going up hill on my bike was bad enough"" Michael told me when we got to the top of the hill. We swapped back, for good reasoning to. I took one last look at Johannesburg before riding down the other side of the hill. I would have taken more photos but I already deleted enough photos as it was because I was using a memory card which had 128 megabytes of space which I was disappointed about. After biking, and sometimes hiking up hill we later got to the construction zone which I was glad to see them at work on the road. After this we biked down hill and then were at the car. From here we drove home. I had to miss Monday of school which we had not expected to miss but ended up having to. This was an exciting adventure which I been so long wanting to return here, I hope to go up to the summit some day. After all, This is my America! Images View This is my America!

single-day,"Forbidden Peak East Ridge Direct
""Oops, my crampons are at my parent's house in Renton!""I had Wednesday off work so I asked Chico if he wanted to go climb something. He quickly agreed and the plan to climb the east ridge of Forbidden Peak was born. The plan was simple, I'd get off work at 6:00 pm on Tuesday and head strait home to pack up my gear. Chico would meet me at my apartment in Ballard around 8:00 pm and we'd leave as soon as possible after that. All was going very well until we started loading gear into Chico's car. I had everything loaded and remembered that I needed to get my crampons! ""They're just in my car, let me go in the garage and get them out,"" I told chico as he started his car. But upon looking in my car, they were no where to be found. Then it hit me, I have been house sitting for my parents while they are in Australia and the last time I climbed something I slept there the night after, leaving some of my gear. I could picture them sitting just under the fireplace... :( So I had a decision to make, either take boots and heavy crampons (didn't sound fun), or running shoes and no crampons (didn't sound as safe). I chose the running shoe option rationalizing that I'd just chop steps! We set off from Seattle around 8:15 pm and made it to the trailhead around 11:30 pm. I'd read trip reports of people sleeping on the ground at the trailhead and having critters run all over them at night. I didn't want that so I slept on the roof of Chico's car. It was a cloudless night and never got cold at all. bed for the night, the roof of a car The Climbat 3:50 am the alarm on my phone went off and quickly Chico and I were awake and packing last minute things. A few minutes earlier another car had pulled up and there were two other people packing. Turns out they were going to climb the torment forbidden traverse (we saw them from the summit and I'm pretty sure they bailed at the west ridge notch, although I don't know why because it was around 1:00 pm when they were at the notch). Anyway, we left the car around 4:14 am. We weren't sure how long the trip was going to take us. All I knew was that I had to work at 8:00 the next day and wanted to sleep a little before working 9 hours. In the back of my head I assumed this trip would be an epic! The trail up to Boston Basin was fairly eventful, except for the constant brush in our faces and the always nagging side alder trying to pull the ice axes off our packs. We made it to the basin in a little under and hour and a half. Forbidden was already looking fun! the first good view of forbidden Neither of us had been to Forbidden before so we lost the trail at the creek crossing and ended up going about 100' (vertical feet) up the creek before crossing it. Because of this we had to cross some slippery slabs. Chico wiped out and I watched his slid down the slabs about 20' after hitting his head fairly hard. It was a scary few seconds but he is tough as nails and we were soon on our way, Chico a bit dirtier than before. oops, he slipped! We found the trail and followed it up until it was all snow. We took the first gully we could find to make out way up to the small glacier. Here we filled up water and rester for a few minutes. Continuing up with some scrambling and snow, we reached the edge of the glacier and looked for the ""gully"" Beckey talks about in his route description. I thought it'd be more of a gully rather than a snow slope leading up to a minor scramble. Thankfully, the snow was more than soft enough for sunning shoes! Within no time at all we were in the sun an on the east ridge. into the sun mount buckner and the boston glacier I led out on a fairly uneventful first pitch which I stretched out for a full 60 meters. Chico followed quickly and was soon standing on top of the first real large gendarme of the ridge! Chico on the first big gendarme Before this second pitch, the climbing was a bit loose, but here things became much more solid. At the top of the gendarme, the climbing began to feel like a ridge climb as the ridge narrowed and the exposure increased. I arrived at the to of the gendarme to see Chico belaying at the base of the knife edge traverse pitch! I was super excited to lead it. Chico belaying just before the knife edge traverse I started out on the traverse a little alarmed at how hollow the rock sounded, but the pure fun of the climbing soon took over and the rock became solid again. A little less than a year ago, Chico and I were climbing the knife edge of Dorado Needle. The memories rushed back as my fingers gripped the knife edge of rock and my feet smeared on the solid rock... what a way to spend a day! But the traverse was over far too soon and I was climbing toward a belay. looking back after the traverse, chico is just after the knife edge part pitch chico finishing the traverse pitch The next pitches went very quickly and were fun climbing up and over gendarmes and across narrow sections of the ridge. We were swinging leads and it seemed that Chico got to climb all the gendarmes and I got to do all the thin ridge climbing. This was true for the crux as well. I climbed to the base of the crux pitch and set a belay for Chico's lead. He led the crux with confidence, though a little surprised to find the actual crux a move after what he thought would be the crux. The climbing on this pith was solid, protectable and slightly overhung, a thrilling pitch for sure. chico pulling the crux Chico set a belay shortly after the steep gendarme as the rope drag was fairly bad coming over such as bad angle. Since his pitch was so short, he led out on another pitch, this time much easier. In the middle of the pitch he called back, ""check this out!"" As I look up I see him hanging in the air doing a heel hook on an overhanging section. heel hook! HAHA! I had to laugh, only Chico would go out of his way to find something to heel hook on while in the 8th pitch of a route like this. Anyway he climbed about 40 meters then set a belay on a great exposed horn and brought me up. I took the lead and less than 30 meters later I was standing on the summit. It was just before 1:00 pm. I belayed Chico up who was surprised at how short the pitch was. On the summit we took pictures, signed the register and then began our descent. We could see the two climbing the Torment Forbidden Traverse. Just before we started down they were at the West Ridge notch. chico arriving near the summit signed summit register classic summit shot coiling the ropes before rappelling a few times We took the East Ledges descent since the West Ridge couloir looked like it wouldn't be as fun in running shoes without crampons. We did a few rappels down the ledges than got sick of rappelling and just put the rope away and downclimbed/traversed our way back to the notch where we started. I had heard so much about the east ledges and how sketchy they are. I found them to be quite simple and easy. We were back at the ridge in no time at all. scrambling the east ledges From the notch, we cruised down the slopes back to the ""gully"" which we downclimbed carefully (much sketchier than the east ledges in my opinion). Once we were back on snow, we did standing glissades down all the way to the trail. The trail to the creek crossings was easy, but we both were a little worried about crossing the creek during such a hot part of the day. boston basin is beautiful last look back at forbidden The first creek crossing was uneventful. The second however was a bit more tense. We arrived at the creek to this... the creek after the glaciers had been in the sun for hours All we wanted was to get back to the car so we could drive to the nearest restaurant and eat food. But a rushing creek was blocking our way. Two other climbers were waiting in the shade on the other side of the creek contemplating crossing towards us (I think I recognized one of them from MANY trip reports I've read... in fact, I'm pretty sure he should take half the blame for me getting into climbing, his trip reports were half the literature I read in college, the other half being MVS's trip reports of course... thanks for getting me though school guys!). Anyway, we wandered up the creek a ways to find a sketch crossing that led to a steep and slippery embankment traverse and eventually to solid ground (probably the crux of the day). It was a short 40 or so minutes and Chico and I were changing into cotton clothes at the trailhead around 5:45 pm. Turns out this trip wasn't as epic as I had imagined. Well, it was epic in the sense that we got to climb one of the most beautiful mountains and have it to ourselves in a day without any clouds or mosquitos and minimal black flies. But not epic in the 20+ hour day with no water or food in the freezing cold type of way. Sitting in the parking lot we stared up at Johannesburg. We were both thinking the same thing, ""that's next, the NE buttres, it would HAVE to be epic!""

multi-day,"Battle on Mt Rainier's DC Route
June 4th 2013 - Tuesday Ugh…the 14 hours of hell. If you’ve ever driven 14 hours straight then I salute you. For you sir or madam, are a true champion.  Also, I truly feel that paying this price for a mountain should tell you just how much we wanted to experience Rainier. Tyler, Jason, Bri (who was not climbing) and I (Anders) began our journey at about 2 AM, leaving Salt Lake City and heading straight for Paradise, WA for our permits.  I think the worst thing about this drive is the portion through Oregon where you can only go 55 or 65 and they make you feel all posh by not letting you fill your own gas tank. It made me long for the stretches in Utah of I-15 where they give you an 80 mph limit. The only redeeming thing about the Oregon stretch is the preponderance of Dairy Queens. My belly ached for a constant supply of cookie dough blizzard. The little voice inside me said, “Not yet…you only deserve a treat after you summit Rainier.” Cast of characters: Tyler ""Coach"" Jason ""Ace of Jace"" Bri ""epithet needed"" Anders ""Your author"" We arrived at the Nisqually park entrance at about 3 or 4 PM. I wasn’t thinking too clearly because we had received some very aesthetically pleasing views of Rainier. We were hoping we could get our permits right at the entrance. We rolled out of the car and went inside the information center. There was a precious model of Rainier, a topographical map type thing. I can only imagine all the kids with jam hands who have touched it, but I didn’t even care. I didn’t hesitate to trace the Disappointment Cleaver route with my finger, suppressing the impulse to wash my hand. Finally we walked over to the ranger sitting at his desk. He was a pleasant young man and our conversation went something like this ( it probably didn't happen):      “So, we want to climb the mountain,” said Tyler, brimming with confidence. I can only imagine what the ranger was thinking. Here we were…three guys and a girl all wearing flip flops and shorts and smelling of car funk. “What mountain?” He asked dubiously.      “I’m sorry,” I said, being a real sicko. “I thought we were in Rainier National Park. Aren’t we in Rainier National Park?”     “Oh,” he said, still perplexed that people in flip flops wanted to climb the mountain. “What kind of gear do you have?”           “Oh, we’ve got our stuff in the car,” Tyler said, putting all joking aside. “We just need the permits.”   Mt Rainier - from the south. June 4th 2013 The ranger then instructed us to head to Paradise. From there it was a fun little drive up the mountain to the Jackson Visitor Center. Once there we filled out the form for our $44 (each) climbing passes and the nice lady ranger hooked us up with a group permit. I was named climbing leader of our small and yet sexually charismatic party (Bri’s words). I think I was picked mainly because I think Jason and Tyler didn’t want to fill out the form. I would later have to suppress giving commands like, “take a picture of me over here,” or “feed me a stray bird.” Anyway, it was probably the best form ever and we never talked about who was leader again. We wandered around for a bit and then made our way to Spanaway, WA to spend the night with Bri’s aunt and uncle. Just a short digression…they were very nice people and their farm was really pretty. Their horses were pretty much flirting with me to take their pictures the whole time. June 5th 2013 – Wednesday As you can see the horses were flirting all day, trying to get me to take photos of them.We had kind of a late start getting up and ready. Bri’s aunt made us a great breakfast of eggs and muffins and we set off. We arrived at the trailhead in Paradise at around 8:45 AM. Bri was nice enough to take some pictures of us and then she drove away. It’s like she didn’t even care. I think she just wanted to visit with her friends in Seattle. Anyway, there was nothing for it but to begin our journey!  Tyler, Jason, and I begin our journey from Paradise. We started hiking up the trail from the visitor center at 9:15 AM. There were a few clouds obscuring the summit, but there were no other clouds in sight. It was looking to be a very good day. Soon we were off on the snow plodding up the hill. We met a guide who gave us a few pointers. Jason had actually gotten off trail, but the guide pointed us in the right direction. We pulled out some false bravado and told him we were going for the summit and butchered Ed Viesturs motto that “getting to the top is optional.” Instead we said, “getting to the top is mandatory. Getting back down is optional.” Despite saying this many times no one thought it was funny. Okay, let’s have a “realtalk” moment. My climbing partners and I have actually turned back on plenty of mountains. Weather, time, or snow conditions can really dictate if you will press on or not. The mountain will always be there…unless it explodes like St Helens…but even then I guess it’s still there. So, we just enjoy the experience for what it is and live to come back another day. We were actually humbled by the magnitude of the mountain and were trying to keep our spirits light and our motivation high. Okay, real talk moment over. Jason leads us astray...which seems odd because the whole route is wanded. I think you actually have to summit Rainier to gain permission to slide down the this slope. We passed a few day hikers who were struggling up the steep slope beneath Panoramic Point. Now this was more like it! I l appreciated the steepness of the hill but the sun was coming out in full force, making me sweat. I was wearing a sleeveless Marmot trail running shit and my Arcteryx Rampart rock climbing pants. Despite the thinness of my clothing my body refused to stay cool. It was as if we had brought the Utah sun with us and unleashed the fires of hell. Seeing as how I had been a good boy all day this hellfire didn’t make much sense to me. Throughout the course of the day it would only get worse. We took a short break near Panoramic Point...it was probably the second best break ever. Anyway, this is the view. I'm pretty sure that's Mt Adams in the background. Jason didn't even care. Tyler takes a breather as he waits for Jason and I to catch up. It was about 10:20 AM by the time we made it to Panoramic Point. There was a nice jumble of rocks to sit on, but I was too busy snapping shots of the surrounding mountains to be bothered. It was about this time that I really wished I was wearing shorts or maybe a loin cloth. I think future trends will be the gaiter loin cloth combo. It’s totally going to be a thing. Anyway, after a short reprieve we were off again.  We passed a few more people and realized that the snowfield seemed to go on forever. There were a few AT skiers slogging up and they passed us. I’m pretty sure I mumbled curses at them as they passed us. It wasn’t because they were going faster; please don’t get the wrong idea. I was jealous of their skis and wanted some of my own.  The snow was quickly becoming a mess. I’m grateful for the many people who had broken trail before us, because it made the going so much easier. Anytime we got off the beaten path we would post hole like…old man Winters digging holes for posts back on his farm. If you want to know more about Old Man Winters…just think of the guy who would yell and get belligerent if a Frisbee landed on his yard. Our team became increasingly more spread out; Tyler in front, me in the middle, and Jason bringing up the rear guard. It is a well-known fact that I do not do well in heat. It’s pretty much my kryptonite. I sweat too much and it just so happened that I hadn’t brought enough water. I had one liter of water and a liter and a half of Poweraid. There was no way I was breaking into my full liter of Poweraid, as that was to be used for the summit day. This meant that I became increasingly belligerent the hotter it became. I began to throw snowballs at complete strangers, but in retrospect I’m pretty sure it was just Tyler. I began to just put snow in my mouth and let the volcano that was my insides melt it. It worked somewhat but eventually I noticed that Tyler had stopped to rest on some rocks. I was glad for the rest and I couldn’t see Jason behind us, so it was probably for the best. I’m not sure exactly where we were below Camp Muir but we put it at about 1500 feet maybe. I downed a few breakfast bars and 300 calories later I was feeling pretty good.  We took quite the long break and I took the opportunity to take some more pictures.  Jason thought we were making our way up a volcano...not that it was in his shirt! So...we decided that the Muir Snowfield should be given the very appropriate epithet...Never Ending Snowfield. Tyler ponders the meaning of life as we indulge in our second break for the day. We were about 1000 or 1500 vertical feet below Camp Muir. The cloud turned our day into a white out. It actually made the sun more bearable...but it was now humid within mr cloud. If you look close you can see Tyler in front of Jason. About 30 minutes after our break spot we were hit by a cloud that whited out our long rang vision. I literally couldn’t see more than a hundred feet or so in any direction. I loved it. Along with my increased caloric intake, the lack of direct sun made me feel even better. I’m pretty sure I should only climb at night or in white outs now. At first I was saddened that my cloud friend left, but as it departed I was graced with the sight of Camp Muir only a few hundred feet before me. Mr Cloud decided to be nice and part just as I neared Camp Muir. It was 2:00 PM when I waddled into Camp Muir. So it took us about 5 hours to make it up 4500 vertical feet. Considering the hot nature of the day I was fine with this result. Tyler was sitting on a rock in the sun whistling the song of his people (he is a ginger). We chit chatted with one of the guides as we waited for Jason to arrive. He was a nice guy and gave us some good information about our summit day. He seemed pleased that we were pushing to Ingraham Flats and let us know that would make our day easier. He also told us to try to be off the Disappointment Cleaver by around 9 AM because the shallow snow there had been turning to mush in the heat. I ate some more Sunbelt raspberry filled breakfast bars as we listened to the guide. I contemplated eating the banana in my pocket, but I decided not to just yet. Jason arrived about 20 minutes after I did and we had a good time laughing and reminiscing over our journey. We put on our crampons and harnesses and were off again about 3 PM onto the Cowlitz Glacier.  Jason makes his way out of the clouds and into Camp Muir. It was so nice sitting on the bench. It rejuvenated me for the push up to Ingraham Flats. Some guides at Camp Muir. They loved our idle banter so much that they pretended not to listen intently to every minute of it. Jason rejoins us at Camp Muir. Tyler gets ready for glacier travel. Our first glacier to cross...Cowlitz. Look close...you can see 4 teams of 4! We gave Jason the sharp end of the rope to set our pace and I was given rear guard duties as I have more mass than Tyler or Jason. We figured I would be a good anchor if Jason fell through a snow bridge. The sun was really slapping us about now. Despite reapplying sunblock several times I could feel the sunburns coming. Looking back at Camp Muir. Jason wanted more sun, so we stopped to throw snow balls. Crossing the Cowlitz Glacier we passed about four parties coming back from successful summit bids, which is always nice to hear. We had heard that only about a week before there had been a lot of snow dumped on the mountain which had deterred several climbers. This news invigorated us and put some spring in our steps. We shot up Cathedral Gap (passed some rocks that had fallen in the snow) and received our first sight of the Ingraham Glacier and Little Tahoma. I must say that this “little” mountain on the side of Rainier looks rather imposing. It was here that the crevasses were much more prevalent. We could see how massive the ice was and how beautiful as well. And wouldn’t you know I had my camera out! We crested a small hill and we could see where our camp would be on Ingraham Flats. We could also see the trail through Disappointment Cleaver. I must admit that it looked intimidating, as the trail just seemed to traverse a slope where if you fell it would be a short trip into a crevasse. I just told myself that it must not be as scary up close and it’s still only class II. I might have also told myself that there was a cookie dough blizzard waiting on the other side. I might lie to myself like this all the time.  Crevasse on the Ingraham Glacier Little Tahoma - Vicious looking mountain. First sight of Ingraham Flats - our high camp. If you look up and to the right from camp you can see the Disappointment Cleaver Route. We arrived at Ingraham Flats at a little before 4 PM. So it took us a little less than an hour to make it to our high camp from Camp Muir. We scoped out some places where we could place our tents and asked some gentlemen where we could go so as not to disturb the guides. They just told us where the guides had probed and just about anywhere would be okay. They even let us use their shovel to dig ourselves out a nice platform for our tents. Thanks guys, you were a big help! Now…please don’t judge us too harshly here, but we each brought our own sleeping establishments. I have a terrible time sleeping next to people so I brought my own Nemo “2” man tent. Jason brought a MSR Hubba Hubba (I think – I can never keep track if it’s the HH or Mutha Hubba) 2 man tent and Tyler brought his bivy tent. Our sleeping arrangements. By 5 PM we were all snug in our tents. I had changed into clean clothes and was covering up my sunburns. For dinner I used my Jetboil stove to boil water for my Mountain House spaghetti with meat sauce meal. It’s probably my favorite right now and it was just what I needed to send me into a food coma. I also made some Swiss Miss hot chocolate (sorry for all the product placement). I also made sure that I would have enough water for summit day. I would have 2 liters of water and a liter of Poweraid. Our talk and laughter died down and by 7 PM we were trying to get a few hours of sleep. Jason checks his phone for service...which he had! If you look past him you can see the route to the spine of the cleaver. Another shot of the route as it passes onto the cleaver. Top left you can make out the trail through the snow. June 6th 2013 - Thursday I was having a wonderful dream. I had just won the Quidditch world cup and Hermione…uh…then I started hearing my name being called. A burst of adrenaline must have shot through my heart because I was up in a start.  “The guides are already up and are waking everyone up,” Jason mumbled into the cool night air.   “What time is it?” I heard myself ask.  “About twelve thirty,” Jason answered.   “I wonder how cold it is…”      “If you want a Ginger’s guess…I’d say it’s 38. Want to know how I know that? Sleeping outside every other week.” (Tyler is a guide for a company that takes troubled youth and adults on wilderness retreats all over Utah). It would later turn out that Tyler was spot on with his temperature gauge. I thought it was a very pleasant temperature in my tent, but it wasn’t cold at all outside either. I then pulled out my trusty headlamp and found that it had been on all night. Sweet…Ithought. It was still shining so I thought it would be okay. Jason fired up my stove to boil some water for his breakfast of chicken and rice. The Propane/Butane mix was cold and so the stove took its sweet time boiling the water. Apparently one should sleep with the propane in their bag to keep it warm for best results. I contemplated making some brown sugar oatmeal but the thought of it made me want to never eat oatmeal again. I put down more raspberry breakfast bars and called it good. Jason asked if anyone wanted some of his meal and I happily obliged myself. I was all ready to climb so I just stood around shoveling the food into my face. Soon we were all roped up and ready to go. I had my audiobook playing in my earphone (I leave one out so I can hear my partners or nature. It’s the best of both worlds). We were the last to leave camp at about 1 AM. We could see the stream of headlamps before us, and we followed the beaten path. The snow was perfect. Our crampons eagerly bit into the icy crust and held up our weight nicely. It was a large contrast to the postholing we did during the daytime. We quickly caught up to the line of climbers before us and soon we were heading onto the cleaver. Suddenly the line stopped and the guides began to shout about the snow conditions. They told everyone to clip into the fixed line. The words “anchor!” and then “clipped!” began to be shouted into the cool night air. I had time to look about. We had the steep slope of the cleaver to our left and to our right the steep drop into darkness. Soon it was our turn to clip in and we were off following the lights up the steep cleaver. I was a little surprised at how steep it was, especially in the darkness. It also didn’t feel like we were going that fast and I kept wondering when the climbers from Camp Muir would catch up. I was grateful when we finished the traverse onto the cleaver and began going up. It felt like an eternity going up the fixed ropes. Finally we made it to the upper cleaver and we said goodbye to the fixed ropes. It was about this time that I could see the line of lights from Camp Muir. It looked ike they were kind of close, and I wondered if indeed they would catch us. We just continued to plod on and upward. It was a great night. There was just a little bit of wind to keep us from overheating. I was so warm all I had on was a base layer and a softshell jacket. Even my gloves were my thin hiking gloves. Remarkably, the line of lights below never approached too closely.  It was around 2:30 AM when we reached the top of thecleaver. The guides had their climbers sit down and put on their down jackets. They were very positive and motivating, telling them that they had just done the hardest part, but that if anyone wanted to turn around they should do so there. What? I thought. You just did the hardest part! The mountain is right there! But lo and behold, some of the climbers wanted to turn back. We noticed the nice climbing duo (who had lent their shovel to us the day before) headed out. After eating some more bars I was chomping at the bit to go. Sorry about the terrible quality of this shot...but it's the best one of the top of the cleaver...early in the morning. The wind decided to pick up a bit more at the cleaver top, but it was by no means fierce or strong. It didn’t have the bite of winter but felt more like the caress of spring. We started up again just before the guides prodded their clients to move. Jason set a nice even pace for us. The next section was pretty steep too, but I think after the cleaver we weren’t about to let anything phase us. I felt very comfortable with it. The snow was perfect and the night was beautiful. The constant pounding of our spikes in snow was rhythmic and even cathartic. I lost myself in the working of my muscles. The night kept my body cool and my limbs were poised in case either of my partners slipped or fell. Our feet were sure and any such heroics were not needed.  As you can see we had perfect conditions! This part was a little scary, so we crawled across the ladder. The higher we plodded up the lighter it became. The sun was still a ways from cresting, but I switched off my headlamp. It had become apparent that it was shining much more dimly than everyone else's. I had extra batteries, but I figured it gave enough light. We started to see the topography of the mountain. Crevasses were everywhere. Giant blocks of ice seemed fixed in place like the scales of some mythical beast frozen in place. The air was thin, but we were making good progress. Almost sunrise. We caught up to the duo at the crossing of a crevasse. A ladder had been set up to bridge the gap. We set up an anchor and belay for Jason to cross, and he crawled to the other side. Once there he anchored himself and set a belay for Tyler. I came across last and took a few pictures. It was now light enough to do so! We continued our methodical pace ever upward and eventually we overtook the duo. They had stopped for a quick break. Sunrise on Rainier The sun crested the horizon and it was such a splendid sight. It is moments like those that make me return over and over again into the mountains. The mix of red on white coupled with the perspective of being up so high made me almost giddy. I made my companions stop so I could try to capture the sight with my camera. Tyler checks things out as the sun comes up. We took a break right below the crater rim. A little below the crater rim we took a break at Tyler’s request. Our now climbing friend duo overtook us as we rested. I ingested more electrolytes and calories and soon we were off again. It was only a few minutes before we were standing on top of the crater rim. Columbia Crest was only a short distance away. I could see vents in the volcano, sending up plumes of steam…reminding me that the mountain was somewhat alive, but just sleeping. It was this point that we knew we were going to summit. The giddiness that threatened to overtake me at seeing the sunrise overtook me. I laughed and couldn’t stop smiling. It was a perfect day. We crossed the crater and made our way up the dirt and rock past more heat vents. Our crampons eventually bit into the firm snow of the summit. Our friends the climbing duo arrived a short time before us and we shared the summit with them. I looked at my watch and it was just after 6 AM. We spent a few minutes on top snapping some pictures and having a bit of fun. Rainier Crater with Columbia Crest just in front of us. You can see the vapor come up from the sleeping giant. Only a few more feet to go! Jason on Rainier's summit. Group Shot! I was so happy to be on the summit. I couldn't stop smiling or laughing. Tyler showing his vert. Sorry, boys...but we're only halfway! There was actually a crest near us that looked like it might be higher, so we decided to head over to it. It certainly wasn’t higher, but it wasn’t a big deal. We continued along the crater rim to where we had first set foot upon it just in time for the guided group to make it to the rim. We were greeted with calls of congratulations which we returned in earnest. It was a great feeling sharing that place with others who had trekked to the top. It also turned out that one of the guys in the climbing duo had a girlfriend being guided up. He went up to the top with her and proposed! I’m not normally a sentimental guy but that was pretty neat. Also, I want to throw out a shout to the guides and climbers who came before us who set all the fixed ropes and broke all the trail. Our summit trip was made infinitely easier and enjoyable because of it. Anyway, we knew that our journey was only half-way over. Our joke of making it to the top being mandatory was staring at us in the face. We wanted to make it down before the sun turned the snow to mush. We would have loved to stay on top longer, but we knew it was time to go. And I’ll tell you what…it certainly didn’t take long for the snow to begin to soften up. Heading down from the crater. Crevasse on the way down. They were all over the place. Please rope up. Soon we were back at the ladder crossing the crevasse. The duo had joked about us crawling across it so this time we walked across. I thought it was a unique experience so I took a shot looking straight down at my feet. We all made it safely across and headed down the steep slopes. We were above the top of Disappointment Cleaver at another snow bridge. The snow was turning soft, and my leg actually punched through the bridge. I was practically already on my belly, trying to distribute my weight across the surface. I felt safe with my guys there to anchor me though and I wormed across. It was only a few feet wide, but scary nonetheless. I took a shot into the crevasse for good measure. Jason crosses the ladder over the crevasse...this time on his feet. Tyler follows Jason over the crevasse. Here I go... Looking into the open mouth... I think we all had a little bit of anxiety about descending the cleaver but in the day it wasn’t too bad. We just took it slow and steady. It was here that I shed my jacket and had my pant vents open to their fullest. The sun was deciding to be mean, seeing as we were able to summit the mountain. The snow was getting slushy as we clipped into the fixed ropes. Tyler mentioned he thought he could ski down the side of the cleaver, and I decided I’m not ready for that yet. Anyway, we kept making our way down the fixed ropes and across the traverse at the bottom.  Going down the upper cleaver. It was scarier at night. We made it back to the fixed ropes. The snow was turning to mush. I was sweating so badly by the time we were on the traverse. It was 9 AM that we returned to camp. It was so hot that I hid in my tent. If it wasn’t for the knowledge that I would have the worst sunburn ever I’m pretty sure I would have descended the rest of the way in nothing but my harness. I was in my tent eating and drinking fluids when some of the guides made it back. They told their climbers not to lie down (and follow my bad example). I was not tired physically though and I repeat…I only wanted out of the sun.  I took this shot of a Finch at Camp Muir. It was probably the best finch ever. We packed up our camp and I found that banana from the day before. For those of you who have needed closure this whole time, I finally ate it. After my time in my tent I was rejuvenated and could once again battle the sun. It was only a short jaunt back to Camp Muir and we spent the time laughing and talking about our journey. Once in Camp Muir we were asked about our trip and we gladly recounted our journey. We removed our crampons and harnesses and headed down the Muir Snowfield. OH! How I longed for skis. We could have made it back to the trailhead in about 10 minutes with skis. As it was it took a few hours…mostly sliding on our feet and glissading every chance we got. I could feel how bad I was burned, despite all my efforts to avoid it with copious amounts of sunblock. We arrived at the visitor center at about 12:30 PM. Only 6.5 hours earlier we had been standing on the summit and the huge mountain in front of us. I kept staring up at it. And all I wanted at this point was a cookie dough blizzard and a nice shower. Both were to be attained later that day, but that is a different story! Here we are...exactly back where we started!

You can pretend like those are ""crevasses"" and ""trails"" but I know they're really just poorly executed efforts at cutting and pasting.

multi-day,"Adventure to Boston Peak and Company
PrologueWho: Josh Lewis and I What Climb of Sahale, Boston, Eldorado and Klawatti Peaks When The last week of August Why Well...you get the idea This trip was a long time coming for me. I had been living in Colorado for over four years and been having lots of fun climbing there. I have been working on the Centennials (Colorado top 100) which is like the Bulgers for Washington but I was always very excited to get back home and head to the North Cascades. Over the past few summers I only visited home in July and was only able to do short climbs in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Pretty hard for even me to believe that this trip was my first time to the North Cascades despite growing up in Renton. This year has so far been the best and most successful climbing years in my life spending all winter and spring in Colorado, a climb of Rainier the 4th of July Weekend, then 5 weeks in Montana before a quick trip back to Colorado. I then returned home for the rest of the year in the end of August. I quickly embarked on my first trip to the North Cascades which would include climbs of Sahale Peak, Boston Peak, Eldorado Peak and Klawatti Peak. I could hardly contain my excitement as Josh and I drove to the Cascade Pass Trailhead after I picked him up from Lynnwood. My Bulger quest had begun. Forbidden Peak sunset from Klawatti Col Day 1 - Sahale and Boston PeaksOur trip started with the long drive up the Cascade River Road. This was my first time here and Josh gave me the grand tour. Since we got to the TH around 6pm surrounded by some low clouds, we decided to just camp there and start the next morning. We organized gear and went to bed with the plan to start around 7 in the morning. By 9am we were finally ooff, after sleeping in a bit. We started up the Cascade Pass trail. This trail was pretty easy since the switchbacks were low angled but the added distance was annoying. It took us about 2 hours to get to Cascade Pass where we stashed some gear and started up the Sahale Arm Trail. Cascade Pass Panorama Since I had just come off over a year at altitude, the hiking was so easy. We made it to the base of the Sahale Glacier from Cascade Pass in less than an hour and roped up for the glacier. I was surprised how small this glacier was and we crossed it in less time than it took us to rope up. Just as we reached the far end of the glacier at about 3pm we met up with two other guys coming down who had camped at the Sahale Arm campsites. They had told us they just came off Boston Peak and we asked them how it was. When they said it wasn't that bad at all I looked at Josh and I think we thought the same thing. ""Wanna try for Boston Peak I ask"" and we were both very excited to give it a go! We got some beta from them and off we went to finish the climb of Sahale Peak. Really, it was very easy. We just climbed the talus to the summit block and scrambled around on some easy class 3 terrain until reaching the top. Now for the real fun. Boston Peak lurked across the way and the ridge traverse for the most part looked like nothing more than an easy walk. We descended some slabs off Sahale and began traversing north. We reached the low saddle in no time and passed by a nice bivy spot. Sahale Peak On the Sahale glacier Scrambling up Sahale Sahale Glacier crevasse Josh ready for the challenge View of the traverse to Boston Boston from Sahale Traversing to Boston At the low saddle We continued climbing up the ridge staying on the crest as much as possible to avoid the steep loose terrain to either side. We crossed numerous knife edge sections but they were all pretty solid. Once we got close to the false south summit we traversed right and descended off the ridge to the head of the enormous Boston Glacier. A short walk at the snow/rock contact led us to a ledge at the base of the east face of Boston Peak. The beta we had gathered said to climb 20 feet up to a second ledge and walk it to its end then begin climbing up the face ""following the line of the mountain"". So we did just that, we climbed 20 feet of loose class 2+ terrain to gain the second ledge and walked a short ways to its end. From there I started to climb, hesitant at first but then I soon realized that the east face was so perfectly ledged out that the climbing rarely even exceeded class 3. Just climb from one ledge to the next following the path of least resistance. The only class 4 move was a small 15 foot chimney near the summit. The rock was no where near as loose as I had been led to believe nor was it all that exposed due to the abundance of nice ledges. The only bad part was that some of the ledges had some ball bearing scree to be sure and avoid. Before we knew it we were on the summit and I was nearly in tears. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that Boston Peak would be Bulger number 10 for me...I thought it would be one of my last ones! Josh and I took in the joy of the moment as we were standing on one of the hardesr Bulgers at 6 in the evening with the late afternoon sun lighting all the surrounding peaks in a bright yellow and orange glow. To the west lie a sea of clouds with Forbidden Peak and Eldorado poking above and to the south Glacier Peak and the whole Ptarmigan Traverse was visible and to the East, Logan and Goode dominated the views. Forbidden Peak in a sea of clouds from Boston Peak Josh on Boston Sahale Sunset Sahale Sunset Cloud glow Mount Buckner from Boston Peak We opened the big metal Mazama Mountaineers box and looked through the book to see so few ascents of this peak. Some well known WA mountaineers in there and I was honored to put my name in the book on page 50. Only 50 pages of widely spaced signatures since 1961. That really impressed me. Since it was getting late we knew we had to get down not just to avoid getting stuck up there in the dark but to also we had to hike down the trail back to the cars. We pulled the rope out and began setting up the first rappel. There were 3 rappels back down to the top of the Boston Glacier which all went smoothly. The hike back to the Sahale Glacier was gorgeous with the late evening light. We reached the Sahale Glacier just as the sun was setting and ran down the soft snow to the trail. We briefly chatted again with the guys who gave us the beta and thanked them and off we went down the trail. We reached Cascade Pass again just as complete darkness came and a bunch of fog rolled in. We took a quick break to snack and finished the long walk down the trail. Sunset over Bonanza Peak Day 2 - Eldorado PeakDay two started with a decent sleep in and a quick reshuffle of gear. We started up the Eldorado climbing route by crossing the log over the Cascade River and slogging up the steep trail. This took hours as we had to hike through the dense forests, scramble up the long boulder field, and hike up the ridge to cross over into the next drainage to the west. We reached snow and roped up for the Eldorado Glacier. Staying right, we climbed moderate snow and got to the incredible ice cliffs formation. Ice Cliffs We continued across the long flat portion of the glacier and reached the east ridge of Eldorado sometime in the afternoon. We were also greeted with our first views of Klawatti. After stashing some gear, we continued the easy ascent to the summit of Eldorado, passing over the infamous knife edge at the top. Eldorado Peak Johannesburg Mountain Forbidden Peak Dorado Needle Eldorado Knife Edge Eldorado Summit Dorado Needle Josh on knife edge From the summit the views towards Forbidden Peak, Klawatti Peak, and Johannesburg Mountain were all absolutely fantastic. There are so many great peaks to climb in this area. We began the descent off the east ridge. I decided to avoid the knife edge going down and took the rock on the other side while Josh went down the snow. We quickly met up again and returned to our gear stash. We made good time roping up again for the long traverse we had ahead of us. Since Klawatti Peak was our next goal, we started traversing the Inspiration Glacier up high and walked below the impressive north face of Eldorado. The sun got lower and the lighting we had that evening made for some of THE most beautiful sights I have ever seen. Glacier Peak to the south had such great alpenglow I was in awe at the beauty of the area. We crossed over a sketchy snow bridge and continued down to the cool just to the SW of Klawatti Peak where a perfect camp site was flattened out on some rocks next to the glacier. Snow Bridge Enroute, we had to do a sketchy descent on steep snow to cross over a steep cornice. Upon reaching the col, it was a new high for me as it marked the best place I have ever camped surpassing my previous best camp spot I had last August in Bear Basin in the heart of the Wind Rivers of Wyoming just north of Gannett Peak. We took in the beauty of the sunset with lots of photos, set up the tent, melted water and cooked dinner. Josh got some great twilight photos of Forbidden and our tent while I cooked. Klawatti Peak Klawatti Peak Josh and Eldorado Tepeh Towers Another team Tepeh Towers Klawatti Alpenglow Glacier Peak Forbidden Peak sunset from Klawatti Col Forbidden Peak twilight with tent Klawatti Col Sunset Day 3 - Klawatti PeakWe woke early to find a great sunrise on Eldorado Peak however some high thin clouds diffused the light too much for any real good lighting. We ate breakfast and roped up for the short glacier walk on the upper end of the McCallister Glacier. The plan was to climb the north ridge of Klawatti, traverse across its west face below the Smokestack then climb a gully on the SW face to reach the summit. Let me tell you though, this is one long way around for this peak. Looking back on it, we should have just climbed straight up from where our tent was which would have saved us hours. We began scrambling up the north ridge once we got to the Klawatti/Austrera col and quickly had to negotiate some very exposed fun knife edge sections. Some good routefinding was required to keep the route at third class. We got to the point where we had to traverse the west face, which took for ever since I kept trying to stay high above the vertical cliffs at the base of the face. There is a series of good but narrow ledges you have to find to safely traverse the face and I will save you the trouble by saying, you have to descend all the way to the top of the cliffs to find the best ledges. We had to keep focused the entire time as we continually were routefinding. We were traversing 65 degree loose rock on 6-12 inch ledges with a 100 foot cliff below. It took a mental toll for sure. Once we finally traversed the west face to get around the smokestack, we found a nice rib separating some of the many gullies on the SW face and climbed solid class 2+ to class 3 to the summit. I have never been on a peak surrounded by so much glaciers except for Rainier. But this peak was different than Rainier since there was world class views and rugged peaks everywhere. In my opinion, the North Cascades are the best alpine mountaineering in all the lower 48 states and I can say that without bias ow that I have been extensively all over Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, Oregon and Washington. Eldorado sunrise Josh on the N Ridge Austrera Towers Josh traversing the W face Traversing the W face Austrera Towers Klawatti W face Klawatti SW gullies On the summit of Klawatti Peak We returned the route which took much less time now that we knew the way and quickly packed up our gear and roped up to traverse back across the Inspiration Glacier. By now a series of high clouds were blocking the sun which was nice for the glacier walk. We weaved through the big crevasses and made good time getting back to the Eldorado Glacier to which the ensuing hike out was uneventful. A half gallon of milk and Costco muffins were amazing upon reaching the Shell Station in Marblemount. AftermathTHIS TRIP WAS DA BOMB!!!! Josh told me many times he thought this area is the best in Washington state, and since I firmly believe Washington has the best alpine mountaineering, the area around Forbifdden Peak including Boston, Logan, Goode, Eldorado, Dorado Needle, and the whole Ptarmigan Traverse is likely the best in the country outside Alaska!

Diggler - Oct 2, 2012 8:08 pm - Voted 10/10 nice TR Hey Matt, while I'm not sure I agree with the (frequently used by Washingtonians) viewpoint that the N Cascades are THE best area in the lower 48 for ""alpine mountaineering/climbing,"" so much of that statement just depends on how you define that (height, amount of snow climbing, amount of mixed climbing, amount of glaciers, steepness, ruggedness, ease of access (or lack thereof, ...), that it just depends on what you mean). Regardless, they are some of the most rugged mountains I know of (& certainly some of the hardest to get to!), & a beautiful bunch for sure. Glad to read about your adventure- sounds like it was a blast! Climb safe & keep having fun! Matt Lemke - Oct 3, 2012 12:23 am - Hasn't voted Re: nice TR Diggler, Yeah I know how much goes into that statement. Everyone has a slight bias and I know both of us have spent lots of time in all of the mountains in the lower 48 so I understand there is room for different opinions. The Wind Rivers in Wyoming certainly rival anything in WA. Alpine mountaineering IMO is defined by having glaciers, ice/rock climbing, long approaches/deep wilderness, weather (or the lack of), ruggedness (ie...even mountain passes are very difficult) etc. For me elevation doesn't mean as much (unless it's over 20k feet). Thanks for commenting. I will for sure continue to have fun climbing! Sunny Buns - Oct 7, 2012 5:13 pm - Hasn't voted Nice Photos and TR Thanks for an excellent report - sounds like a fun trip.

multi-day,"The Glacier Peak Epic Experience
Introduction Wow! This trip was one of my most special trips in a long time. It had been two long years since the last time I had done a Cascade volcano and Glacier Peak was in my short list for a very long time. As some of you have known it had been two long years since I have been able to get to the larger volcanoes in the Cascades. I did get Mount Lassen back last year with my wife but this peak was basically just a hike. My year started decently by going down to southern California and Death Valley but has waxed and waned since with a couple of decent climbs such as Big Lou and Icicle Ridge and one other Bulger; that being Dragontail. But I knew that this year was not going to be a true success unless I took a shot at Glacier Peak. I often told many of my partners that if I got Glacier Peak and no other summit than this year was a great success. My friend mtn.climber decided to setup a good 4 day trip up Glacier Peak in September. I was a little out of shape and as late as July my conditioning was at its lowest point. The effort up Dragontail really woke me up to the fact that I need to get into shape and fast. Over the next two weeks I had gone at least 20 miles a week and had knocked off at least 7000 feet of elevation gain. Some my longer hikes and scrambles included Wright Mountain, Mount Roosevelt and Mount Angeles. Luckily there was very little in terms of odd weather and I was really able to kick my conditioning into overdrive. But none of these hikes would ever be able to prepare for a trip like Glacier Peak. The planning could not have gone off better and the weather forecast looked very favorable for this trip. In fact there was supposed to be no clouds in site for the entire trip. Another thing going for us is our team. All of the members on our team were very strong. Our team consisted of Fletcher, OneLuv, mtn.climber, rock n'climb, Jimbopo and me. With a well thought out trip and an excellent forecast I knew this was my best shot at Glacier Peak for a long while. Day 1: Trailhead to White Pass Sloan Peak from the trail Okay if I was going to be able to be successful in getting up to Glacier Peak I was going to have to be able to carry my 45 pound pack 9 1/2 miles and over 3500 feet of elevation to White Pass. I was also going to have to carry the pack in an unusually warm September Day. Of course it didn't help that I had not done this since January and the fact that I was going to clearly be the slowest climber of the team. But there were no excuses now for me because this trip was going to determine the success of potentially the whole climbing year. I met mtn.climber and his son Derek and the trailhead. Our other two climbers, Fletcher and Rob had already started earlier hoping to get both White Mountain and Portal Peak. The first 5 1/2 miles was a warm up to the Makinaw Shelter. This involved some ups and down and wasn't very difficult. But doing it with a heavy pack was real pain. We made it from the trailhead to the Makinaw Shelter in a little less than three hour only to take a lunch break at the shelter. Just getting to this point for me became a major sweat fest. After the break the real climb began to White Pass. This section of trail is well graded through a number of switchback but 3000 feet of elevation gain with a heavy pack for me wasn't very fun. The extra weight I had put on really had made an impact. Luckily my good friend Jimbopo stayed with me throughout the entire the grind up to camp. Views near White Pass Sloan from near White Pass Despite the slow grind up all the switchbacks we were able to make camp at White Pass by 3 pm. For me this was a great victory. During the evening many of the others went to the top of White Mountain to see the sunset. Me and mtn.climber personally wanted to go but thought better of it due to the fact that we wanted to save my strength for the main goal Glacier Peak. I was able to get some great sunset views from camp, but after watching the pictures that the others got from the summit of White Mountain, I realized that I missed out on a golden opportunity. That though was the end of the first day and that night I managed 10 hours of decent sleep. Indian Head from White Pass The sunset that I missed! :( Day 2: White Pass to Glacier Gap The ridge we had to cross After a good long sleep at White Pass, the next day we decided to head to Glacier Gap. This involved a little scrambling and off-trail work, which normally isn't much of a problem. But we all had a heavy pack on. The biggest obstacle of the trip was crossing the ridge from White Pass over to the formal remains of the White Chuck Glacier. We were honestly off route here because everyone who had attempted this peak before attempted at either higher snow years or early times. The goal-Glacier Peak We choose one gully that was done last year in the snow. This time though instead of the group being greeted with a steep snow slope we were greeted with 45 degree loose scree. Before going down the steep gully all of us put on our helmets and slowly headed down. This was another obstacle that with a normal daypack is no big deal but with a heavy pack this can be a real grind. Slowly all of us headed down the steep gully. The last 50 of it ended as snow which a number of people in our capitalized on by doing a slow glissade. A new tarn lake From there we were welcomed to wonderful world of the former White Chuck Glacier. This moonscape once served as a very large glacier as recently as the 1970's. Now the glacier has receded to mostly a scree and occasional snowfield landscape. It should be quiet interesting to find out what this place is going to look like 30-50 years from now. The former White Chuck Glacier While traveling across this moonscape we slowly traveled over what was formally the White Chuck Glacier and up past a number of lakes and steep slopes. The travel time had to be slow do to unstable scree of what we were walking on. Slowly though we were able to pick our way through the landscape all the way to Glacier Gap. Some of us camped at Glacier Gap while a couple of us camp at a sub peak just north of Glacier Gap. A number of us were thinking about attempting nearby Kololo Peak but we all agreed not to in order for us to save our energy on what was our main goal; Glacier Peak. Views from the area That night we camped out on what started out being a windy night. Jimbopo and I had to use rocks in order to solidify our tent. The wind continued throughout the evening but eventually died down during the night. Most in our group stayed up in order to see the sunset. However I was tired so I went to sleep well before 6 pm. because I knew we were going to have a huge day the next day. Day 3: Part 1: Glacier Peak summit and the backpack down to White Pass Heading to the summit At dawn all us woke up for the day that we all were looking for; the summit of Glacier Peak. We all quickly got ready and by 6 am we are starting our ascent of Glacier Peak. We made decent time rising up the southern slope of Glacier Peak passing to the east of Disappointment Peak. There were some miniature crevasses but nothing to large or dangerous. There was some minor rock fall that was coming off of Disappointment Peak so we had to keep our focus up during the traverse. Looking down the ridge The crux the Cool glacier icefall lied just ahead. This area had a number of interesting moats and crevasses and required a lot of special attention. Going up this section we all took our time in order to make sure that all of us were safely across. This section was the slowest section on our trip. We were able to make it safely across and soon were continuing our trip up Glacier Peak. Nearing the summit Soon we were in the gap between Glacier Peak and Disappointment Peak. From here it was just a 1000 foot Class 2 dirt and scree scramble to the true summit of Glacier Peak. Fletcher, Jimbopo and OneLuv charged ahead while I and mtn.climber slowly pick our route up to the summit area of Glacier Peak. The last dirt scramble was not very difficult and all of us go to the true summit by 10 am; 4 hours from Glacier Gap. Riding the summit The team The views from the summit were excellent with pretty much all of the volcanoes and well over 1000 summits within view. Many people who have climbed all the volcanoes in Washington have claimed that Glacier Peak has the best views in Washington State. From what I saw I will agree with them, though I think Rainier has the best sunrises, especially with Little Tahoma in the foreground. We spent an hour on the summit, basking in the 50 degree summit temperatures, signing the log book, bouldering on the summit rocks. We also traversed all across the summit in order to enjoy all the wonderful views that Glacier Peak has. Summit Views Summit Views Summit Views Summit Views Day 3: Part 2: Heading BackAll of celebrated in our success, but we all knew that the trip was only half way over. We still had almost 20 miles of rough backcountry in order to get back to trailhead and truly enjoy the success of the trip. So we got back and headed back down to the gap. At first the travel was slow with the loose scree. But around 500 feet down from the summit of the footing got better and all of us were able to fly into the gap. Most of us including me decided to go up the quick scramble to Disappointment Peak where more excellent views awaited. The view of Glacier Peak from this summit is very impressive. After this quick scramble we were back and on our way down the mountain. Heading down While on the glacier heading back a couple of the crevasses started to open up. We had to take our time as we were crossing the glacier. When we got to the crux of the glacier all of us took our time as we were crossing the icefall. The conditions from the heat of the day were starting to make things very interesting for us. Once through the crux the trip back became much easier. We did hear some rock fall coming from Disappointment Peak but the icefall was not very bad and we were able to make very good time back to camp. It took us a little less than three hour to make it back to camp. Careful!! On the snow Once back at camp though we had to pack up the camp and head down to White Pass. We took a little break but we knew we had little time or we would be headlamping it back to White Pass. Fletcher the quickest person in our group had to rush on back to the car because he had work early the next morning. Rob went with him all of the way back to White Pass to make sure that he made back to the place safe and sound. For me heading back was tiring. This is where my physical fitness was really starting to catch up with me. I was tired from the climb but I knew I had to hold myself together because one the hardest sections of the trip were yet to happen. On the way back over ridge separating White Pass and White Chuck Glacier we took a different way back. Fletcher and Rob were able to quickly find their way around this section and were at White Pass in 3 hours. The rest of us struggled through this section. Mtn.climber and his son Derek once on the ridge decided to find their way across by doing a very tough Class 3 rock and dirt scramble through the ridge. They made it back faster than Jimbopo and I, but had a lot more thrill. A look back at our success Jimbopo and I dropped through a gully to what we thought was a climbers trail. That trail soon faded and we did not see a safe way back so we dropped in elevation and the then traversed over until we finally rose back up the ridge to find the climbers trail again. This way was much longer than the way mtn.climber and Derek did but there were no major scrambles. At one point Jimbopo was worried that we were going to have off trail for the evening but eventually we were able to find the trail and get back to White Pass. We beat sunset and were able to setup camp just before sunset. Day 4: Back to the Trailhead The last day's sunrise The last view of White Pass Okay all we had was 9 1/2 miles left downhill and we were home free. But after the past three days we were all beat. So this last day at least for me was a really grind. I was at first able to gather decent speed as I headed down the mountain. But as the elevation lowered the valley floor began to heat up and that at this point was beginning to play games with my tired body. To make matters worse my now blistered feet and numerous heat rashes were really giving me problems. I still though made great time back to the Makinaw Shelter. But past the Makinaw Shelter I really began to slow down. I was in real pain here and the impacts of the climb were starting to get to me. The heat at this point was really affecting not only my energy but my mode. What made this worse was the fact that I had one annoying bee follow me for at least 3 miles while I was heading back to the car. But at this point I knew that I was in the home stretch and so I fought through all of my pains and finally made the trailhead around 1 pm. At that point all I could is YEAH!!!!!!!!! I have successfully climbed Glacier Peak. ConclusionThis trip could only be described as epic. It took all the mental and physical strength I had to be successful here but in the end we all did it successfully and safely. The final volcano of all the stratovolcanoes is now complete and summer is a complete success. Everything else from this point on is gravy. I got the goal I wanted and now I can focus on many more awesome climbs. Don't worry the adventures will continue. I want to thank everyone for their awesome company. Everyone here played a role in the trip's success. First of all I want to thank Dave for inviting me on this awesome climb. OneLuv we all have to thank for leading us through the most dangerous part of the crux. Fletcher and Derek were awesome climbing partners as well sticking close by and being excellent company on a great trip. I hope to climb with all of them many, many times again.

Since we didn't want to finish up on pumice (after all, it's Glacier Peak), we continued across the Cool Glacier, paralleling the crevasses, and onto the Chocolate. We climbed a steep, narrowing snow chute between two rock cleavers, popped through a keyhole between the rock tower on the left and the little bergschrund, crossed a short hog back and were on the summit snow cap. Fun climb and no dirt (once we finally made it to snow). Long day from White Pass. Viewing: 1-6 of 6 to post! Don't have an account?"
multi-day,"The Jack Mountain Assault: A 4 Day Epic
Introduction ""The one who follows the crowd will usually get no further than the crowd. The one who walks alone, is likely to find himself in places no one has ever been."" -Albert Einstein Jack Mountain is rarely ever climbed due to it's all around alpine difficulty. The Previous year Yem and I made an attempt up Jack Mountain in icy conditions. This time I came more prepared with better mountaineering skills, went in better condition, and brought my ice tool as a second axe. But it still ended up being an epic trip with many exciting moments as well as getting on the edge of my comfort level. This mountain lives up to it's reputation. It has been unusually cloudy this summer making it difficult to obtain a good weather window. When the forecast looked halfway decent, we knew that this would be the best time to make a go for Jack. Yem picked me up from my house on the morning of July 19th. On the way we enjoyed a quart of chocolate milk which is part of my mountaineering tradition. Our Route up Jack Mountain Day 1: Going into Jerry Lakes BasinWe arrive at the Canyon Creek trailhead around noon which meant that the day was already hot. The trail to ""Crater Lake"" is about 62 switch backs (we counted both on the way up and down) with about 3,900 feet of elevation gain. Crossing the creek this time was not as bad, although we still had to take our shoes off. Before arriving at the lake there were some downed trees on the trail which we had to climb over or go around. At the lake I had to go from tennis shoes to plastic boots due to the wet spots and eventually snow patches. The ending of the trail marked the beginning of the scramble up to the Jerry Glacier Saddle. There was a little bit of loose rock which is why I waited for Yem to climb up all the way until I would go up. I admit climbing in plastics isn't quite as friendly for scrambling as shoes. At the top of the scramble was a large snow patch that took us all the way to the saddle (7,200 feet). Majestic Mountain Kimtah and Cosho Peak Scrambling above the Lake Looking toward Crater Lake Going to the the Saddle Looking up at Crater Mountain Jack With Wavy Clouds Jackita Ridge during Evening Waterfalls on Crater Mountain At the saddle we could see Jack Mountain and our camping destination below. We took a break and roped up for the Jerry Glacier. The rest of the way was an easy walk down about 1,300 feet of elevation loss. As we were hiking down I could see clouds rising over Jack Mountain making it questionable whether we would make a summit bid the next day. Finally we arrive at the Jerry Lakes which after a little searching we found a flat place to camp. As I cooked dinner I enjoyed the alpenglow on Crater Mountain. After this we got some well deserved rest. Yem Heading Up Heading towards Jack Mountain Roped up for the Jerry Glacier Sunset on Crater Mountain Alpenglow on Crater Mountain Clouds before the Storm Jerry Lake Reflection Pink Sky from Camp Day 2: Waiting out the StormIn the middle of the night it started to rain which is when I had to get up and put on my pack cover to prevent it from getting soaking wet outside. Sometimes I would wake up to the booming of thunder. During the morning was when the thunder was at it's worst which we could hear it crashing though the valley. Both of us were completely unmotivated to go outside which I slept in until about 2 p.m. Our Camping Spot near the Lake The rain still continued which even the idea of advancing our base camp soon fell out of the question. Yem told me an amazing story of finding his dog in San Diego and other fun conversations as more hours pass by. Even during evening the sky was foggy making me wonder if the weather would cooperate during summit day. Even though I slept so much the previous night I still managed to sleep great that night as well. The only View we got that Day Day 3: The Summit AssaultWe woke at about 6:45 a.m. and made breakfast. Yem figured an early start would actually be a bad thing considering that on our previous attempt the icy traverse was some of the more sketchy climbing that I've ever done. We were on the move by 7:57 a.m. crossing around the Jerry Lakes. Once we were back on snow I took the lead because I was the only one with plastic boots which went though the snow like butter. And besides I love kicking in steps. The Saddle above was not as dangerous this time because of there being less snow. Once past the snow section we had to do an easy scramble section and then traverse to the saddle. At the Saddle we could barely see Jack Mountain though the clouds. Once again we had to drop down the valley and lose our beautiful elevation. As we went down there was a little bit of bushes which I kept my crampons on to make going down easier even though we were not on snow most of the time. At the bottom we finally stepped foot on Jack Mountain. Crater Mountain's Summit Crater Mountain Clearing Up Clouds over Crater Mountain Yem Scrambling Up Jack Mountain Covered in Clouds I decided to go left to stay on snow as long as possible. Good mountaineering is about taking the path of least resistance, not the most direct way. I don't mind challenges, but no sense in going though bushes when you don't have to. As we hike up though the snow Jack Mountain comes out of the clouds, our good weather window had finally arrived. We continued on past our old camping spot from last year and got onto the first major snowfield of Jack Mountain. Crater's West Face Point 7292 Waterfalls on Jack Jackita Ridge Below Jack Mountain Clearing Up The first Snowfield on Jack Mountain Yem crossing the Snowfield The snow conditions were nearly perfect. Not too soft, but easy to make steps for traversing. I was very pleased that I felt fully comfortable on this, the previous year was so icy that I dreaded every step. After traversing I went straight up the mountain towards our entrance onto the route. The tactic I used was easier because it avoids up sloping traverses. After an hour from when we entered onto the snowfield we arrived on the rocky section. Looking up Jack Mountain Going up this part was much easier using crampons on the loose rock. We curved around the corner where it starts to become class 3. I took off my plastics and swapped to shoes. There was a cairn or two that ensured that we were going the right way. After more class 3 scrambling I come across a rappel sling and start to think ""this route doesn't get any harder than class 3"". A few seconds later my attitude changed very rapidly. The route traversed across a very exposed section that required very careful use of hands. I took one picture and put my camera in my pack (I usually don't put it away on scrambles). I admit that the class 4 section made me nervous, had to carefully plan out exactly where the steps were and test the holds. The rock was loose and crumbling away, looking down I could see rocks tumbling thousands of feet down the mountain in high speed. But I managed to feel fairly comfortable on this terrain. And I know I shouldn't be! Hiking Above the First Snowfield Looking Down Below Class 3 Scrambling Once I arrived at the second rappel sling, I could look directly down on my partner which was an amazing perspective. After a little while I set down my pack and climbed down to make sure that he was doing ok with the class 4 section. Once we both arrived safely at the rappel sling we were past the crux of the climb. But we still had a ways to go. I decided to take the ridge looking route up which was usually class 2 with a few class 3 spots. Eventually it ended which Yem told me that we had to get over to the snowfield on the left. To get there we carefully traversed over and slightly downward. Then the rest of the snow climbing was upwards. This part of the climb was an amazing experience for me. Yem Climbing Across Class 4 Traverse The Ridge Up Hiking on the upper Mountain We used both axes at this part for speed and control going up the slope. Looking down was still exposed, but I didn't feel one bit nervous. I was excited as I kicked in each step saying to myself ""This is Climbing as it should be"". Yem and I joked back to each other saying random ""Touching the Void"" quotes. One of them being that ""Climbing makes you feel more alive"". The adrenaline was pumping and I knew that I was in my element. It had taken us about an hour and a half to climb the snowfield when we arrived onto the summit ridge. Looking down on my Partner The Summit Ridge Jack Mountain's West Ridge The ridge was quite pleasant, the rock was good for the most part and it was much safer than all the other climbing we did that day. Looking behind us was the West Ridge of Jack. The clouds were divided right at the ridge making it have a neat atmosphere to the place. There was one snow patch that I had Yem lead because I was in my tennis shoes. With a little more scrambling and a walk up ""The Ramp"" we arrived on the summit of Jack Mountain! On the summit I celebrated by having a pack of Oreo's with some milk (we used powdered milk). I promised Yem some which I was enjoying them so much that by the time I had only 3 left I realized I had to share. The views were quite incredible, but after about 30 minutes we had to make good time down the mountain. Nohokomeen Glacier Snowfield Peak with Clouds Snow Patch near the Top The Last few Steps Mount Logan's North Face Mount Buckner Black Peak to the South Pyrimid Peak with Clouds Cloudy Atmosphere over Forbidden Peak Looking Down the East Side A Scary DescentI had not fully realized the gravity of what we had climbed. Going up I felt fantastic, but it wasn't until we started to go down that I realized that we had a situation coming up. We quickly scrambled down the ridge and got to the snowfield where I once again swapped to my plastics. As we climbed down the snow I was amazed at what we had gone up, but I was still feeling relatively comfortable. Going down took a lot of kicking in steps and ice ace placements. It was getting late in the day making it important that I down climb as fast as I safely can. At the bottom of the snow I carefully fill up our water bottles. It was a precarious spot to place my pack, but I knew that I had no choice. I was becoming very thirsty from all the kicking steps and could start to feel cramps coming on. Forbidden Cleared Up Golden Horn and the Needles Traverse Section Light Clouds during Evening Green Scenery in the Pasayten Wilderness Mount Goode to the South From here we went slightly up and were soon off the snow. The down climbing had taken us about 2 hours. I swapped back to my shoes fast (every time I did this, to save time I kept the crampons and gators attached and put it in my pack) and was back to scrambling down. Every now and then one of us would send a rock down which we had to be careful about how we were in position of each other. I was surprised how fast we managed to get down to the second rappel sling. This is where things got scary. Scrambling Down We got the rope ready and put it though the rappel ring, my biggest worry came true. It didn't reach. Looking down I dreaded the idea of having to get off the rope and down climb the last section. I knew that if there was anyone to go down first, it would have to be me. Looking around I said aloud ""there's gotta be another way"". We both knew there wasn't. This was the only way down. The rappel position was the worst I've ever seen. The people who put up the webbing couldn't have done much to fix this. With the slightest tug the webbing moved which worried me. We secured it on as best as we could. I said a prayer and got on with the rappel. To start out I had to go over to the right where there was a minor ledge. With one hand I held on to the brake and the other I held the rock. I had to traverse more towards the webbing to get it in motion. But as I got closer it became increasingly more over hang like. My arms were exhausted from the climbing and were starting to give way. I could not figure out a safe position to get to. If I fell, I could majorly swing and pull the sling in a bad direction. I was starting to shake from how scary it was and how strenuous it was. I was getting so tired that I couldn't grip my brake. If I fell it would be fatal. I was terrified. I was almost to the point of tears wondering what I could do. Yem could see that I was not having a good time and finally said ""I'm going to have to ask you to take a leap of faith"". My heart was pounding, I was trembling, but I knew that I could no longer stand idle. As hard as I could, as careful as possible I managed to brake in a awkward position and I fell back. The rock held and I continued to rappel down. I was breathing so heavy by this point, when I reached the bottom I was still breathing heavily in disbelief of what just happened. But we still were not down. I unclipped my device and looked for a way down. I made sure the ropes were even and called up that the rappel was as good as it can be. I suddenly heard the whistle of a rock coming right by me shattering into pieces and sailing down the mountain. I immediately hurried to an overhang spot, ducted my head, and hoped that I wouldn't get pelted by a rock. I heard more coming down as I waited on my insecure spot. One foot was being held up by a small hold, while the other I felt slowly sliding down. I was still terrified. As I look over I see the mountains glowing gloriously with orange and red colors. Normally I can take photographs on ledges and strange place, but not this time. Finally Yem arrives down which we had two options for going down. Both of them looked bad. After making careful observations one of them looked outright awful and would be a serious mistake. The one on our right however was possible but not pleasant. Yem came up with a fabulous idea of girth hitching a sling to another sling to the rope. This would give me just enough length to get to the class 4 section. I carefully down climbed this section and on to the class 4 section. Yem mentioned the idea of leaving my rope, he could tell right away that although I might say yes, he knew I might possibly go back for it. So he saved my rope by soloing that section which I very much appreciated. Epicing on the Side of the MountainThe sun had already set which we now had to make best of the remaining day light left. We some what quickly scrambled down the class 3 section and around the corner came back to the snowfield. Going up this class 2 section with crampons was much easier than hiking down in shoes because of the loose rock. I swapped back to boots and we got our headlamps out. It was back to kicking steps and ice axe plunging. By now it was officially night. The snow was solidifying making every step and axe placement more difficult than coming up. Eventually we reach the bottom and can faintly make out our tracks. The sun melted out our steps for the most part making it hard to see where exactly they were. I told Yem ""When you get to my house, you can have all you can eat ice cream"". It took a while to cross the snowfield which once we were on the other side I could finally start having thoughts ""I think I'm gonna make it out alive""! When we got onto the rock it was hard to make out exactly where we were. ""I can't see Jack's eastern high point"" I said to Yem which was a sign of us not traversing enough. I kept my crampons on because I was too tired to bother with them, plus they helped with the scree. We had a rigged idea of where we were, but could not find enough evidence of places we been. So we decided to go to the snow and find the bowl which would lead us back to our tracks. ""Found the trail"" I said with a smile. A few minutes later I announced ""lost the trail"". Our route up went to the right of where we were, but unfortunately we turned too early. It was steep down below as we traversed on snow. Finally it was time to turn around and back track. Back at our newer tracks we cut right though the bushes. Yem mentioned ""You don't mind if we sleep here on the mountain?"". At first I didn't like the idea which we did a little more exploring and found a creek. With it was two okay spots to sleep on. ""I admit, I'm pretty beat myself"" I said. So I approved of the idea and filled up our waters. Unfortunately I had forgotten my shell pants back at camp which I only had shorts for my legs. Yem had some thin long johns he let me borrow. Camp was still a long ways away, and if we were to have tried it we had a bit of elevation gain as well. Oh how I wished that my -20 degree bag that was at camp was with me. I managed to get perhaps 3-4 hours of sleep that night. But every time I woke up I felt very cold and was shivering. Those parts of the night felt very long. I felt so thirsty yet I did not want to move and lose heat. During the early light hours Yem and I were not getting anymore sleep which we were both shivering. Finally we got up, and started the hike down. Day 4: The Long Haul HomeWe did a little bit of traveling though bushes but were down at the bottom in decent time. Looking behind us I could see steams of clouds coming in which I figured meant a storm. We hiked back up to the saddle in about an hour and was able to see our camp down below. Carefully we hiked down to the lake and back to camp. After a good breakfast I took a half hour nap. Yem woke me up and said we had to go. All sorts of mosquitoes were buzzing around the tent. I felt unmotivated to go outside, but knew the sooner we got out, the better. As I packed my gear I had to keep circling the camp to reduce the chances of getting bit. This made packing take longer. The mosquitoes were getting quite bad which is why I was happy to leave the camp spot. Alpenglow on Jack Mountain Sunrise to the South Streaming Clouds The View above Jerry Lakes Jack Mountain during Morning Slowly we slog up hill toward the Jerry Glacier. By the time we arrive the clouds had fully come in making it low visibility. I had Yem lead this part because my legs were tired from all the snow kicking the previous day. Hiking though the fog we missed the saddle. Fortunately it clears for a short spell and we see the way we need to go. At the edge of the glacier we unrope and take a short break. Where are we? Clearing in the Fog Looking Above at the Saddle Our Exit Out Looking Down Crater Waterfalls near the Lake Marsh Marigold Flowers Camp Spot near the Lake The rest of the way down was easier going with good visibility. With a little bit of navigation and staying to the left we arrive at ""Crater Lake"". Before long were on the 62 switch back trail making great time. After hiking down for a while we arrive at the trailhead. As compensation for kicking in steps Yem buys me dinner at Marblemount which I was very pleased. And of course I had to get chocolate milk for the way home. This was a very exciting trip with many experiences on the way. Anyone climbing this mountain I urge you to know that it takes years of mountaineering and is quite an under taking. I want to thank my partner Yem for his research, driving, and good company on this trip. This trip filled my adventure cup for a while, most mountains don't even come close.

We went up a 3rd class that led to 4th class gulley and it became apparent as the rock transitioned from typical cascade loose to compacted dirt gravel that we were not going down the same way. We had left our packs lower, had no rope, and did not know if there was another way off it. Gotta love the committed feeling! We too were not uncomfortable on that terrain, as you noted. It's because you can't afford to be nervous: that kills you. Viewing: 1-20 of 25 12 to post! Don't have an account?"
multi-day,"Three Volcanoes And A Rock
On The Summit Of South Sister Part of the deal I struck with my boss that enabled me to take time off for the Greece and Egypt trip this Spring was to work a promotional gig in Oregon in the middle of July. Bummer! During the height of mountaineering season, on one of the best weekends, I would be stuck working. But then I started thinking about the volcanoes. My counter offer to my boss was to get a company vehicle and a couple of extra days to get back to Washington after the work was done. He accepted. Paulina Peak Overlook Each day I worked I would stare at the three sisters which were visible from the parking lot. After getting off early from my position one afternoon I snuck over to check out Paulina Peak (7985) and Newberry Crater which has a couple lakes and a huge obsidian flow. It was really just a drive up to the rim of an old volcanic crater, but at least it got me over 7000 feet. Lewis Glacier Runoff Pool Lewis Glacier Runoff Pool Then finally the weekend ended. My friend Robbin drove down from Washington to meet me that evening and we went to the trailhead for South Sister (10,358 feet) which is the highest in the Three Sisters Wilderness. We got an early start the next morning and made good time on the south ridge. We passed a small lake at the base of the Lewis Glacier and from there it wasn't far to the summit. On top we had views of the other volcanoes to the north including Middle Sister (10,056 feet), North Sister (10,085 feet), Three Fingered Jack (7841 feet), Mount Jefferson (10,497 feet), and Mount Hood (11,239 feet). We descend quickly making good time even though I took us a little off route. Nearing The Summit Mount Bachelor Visible Near The Summit We had planned to do Mount Bachelor (9065 feet) the next day but there was plenty of daylight left and we were both feeling good so we decided to go for it. We followed the ski lifts on the north ridge and once again made good time getting to the summit although we were both feeling a little tired after 7600 feet of gain. On the summit we met a man from Florida that was also in town for business. His exuberance for being in such an amazing place was contagious. We felt sorry for him living in such a flat place. Mount Bachelor Mount Hood Seen From The Parking Lot We sat on the summit for about a half hour talking, laughing and just being happy to be alive. We bid our friend farewell and turned back to the north ridge. Snow conditions were perfect and I was able to do a standing glissade that lasted for (((2000 FEET))). As my friends know, I love standing glissades and this was the best one to date. We came down 2000 feet in about 18 minutes. Back at the car, there was still plenty of daylight left. I looked at Robbin and half-joking asked her which one we were going to do next. Even if we had wanted to, I was all out of beta so that would have to do. High Rock Lookout On The Summit We agreed to drive north and spend the night in the parking lot at the Mount Hood ski area, so we could admire an even bigger volcano. I've slept there before and even thought I pitched my tent between cars, nobody bothered us. The next morning I was able to get reception on my internet phone so I looked up the information for High Rock (5685 feet). Got it, bingo! Time for one last hurrah before going home. The trail to High Rock was short and easy so I convinced Robbin not to carry her pack. We just put some snacks in our pockets and went up. High Rock is inside the triangle of big volcanoes. From the lookout we could see Mount Saint Helens (8365 feet), Mount Adams (12,276 feet), and Mount Rainier (14,411 feet). We were closest to Mount Rainier. The view of Washington's highest volcano, just a handful of hours after seeing Oregon's highest, was just as impressive if not more so.

single-day,"Injury On North Twin
Sustained good weather, finally! It was going to be a big weekend. North Twin on Friday, the south buttress of Cutthroat on Saturday, and Big Kangaroo on Sunday. Natasha (Summitpost member seabadge) and I left the house at 4am Friday morning, the car loaded with gear and food. Little did we know, our plans for the weekend would be changing. Natasha and I prepared for the 7 mile bicycle approach North Twin seen from the bicycle approach We reached the gated logging road at 6am and found that it was open. We were tempted to drive through it rather than bike the 7 miles each way, but we didn't want to come back to a locked gate and get stuck. I fought the monotony of logging roads by seeing if I could ride all the way to the North Twin spur road without pushing the bike up the steeper parts. I was successful in that little game despite the 2300 feet of elevation gain. After hiding the bikes in the bushes, we followed the spur road to the subsequent boot path which terminates in class 2 terrain at which point the west ridge narrows. Class 2 interspersed with class 3 moves quickly turned into solid 3 scrambling. Olivine rock is the most grippy stuff I have ever set my hands on. Good holds seem hand-crafted and just about everywhere. This is what makes the Twin Sisters range my favorite scramble playground, this being my fourth trip to the area. We used mechanics gloves to protect against the rough sticky rock. gimpilator route finding As with the South Twin, difficulties on or near the crest can be avoided by traverse-scrambling slightly lower on the south face. Natasha joked around by faking tough bouldering moves on the easy terrain while I recorded numerous short clips for a video montage. Occasional cairns hinted at the route as we followed exposed ledges and crossed numerous ribs and gullies high on the south face. Eventually we came to an obvious end to the lower traverse options. What appeared in front of us was a drop-off. It was time to go straight up, back to the ridge crest. Traverse Scrambling Staying Close There were several possible lines. All appeared to be a mix of class 3 and class 4. We picked what looked like the easiest and made adjustments as we climbed. We passed several more small cairns, somewhat encouraging. Natasha asked me if she should stay further back in the gullies in case of rock fall. My reply was that sometimes it's better to stay close behind, so that if a rock gets going, it doesn't have time to build up speed. Overall the rock was very solid but a few loose pieces were present in the gullies. She stayed close behind and I was careful not to dislodge anything when I was leading. Exposed Scrambling I was just mentally congratulating myself for not sending any rocks down, when I heard Natasha yell out in pain. I turned around and she said, ""I just broke my finger"". What!?! She was in the middle of a class 4 section which looked precarious from my vantage right above her. ""I think I broke my finger, I really need to get through this tough spot"". She struggled to get through the difficult move without the use of her left hand. Eventually she made it through and rested on a small ledge next to me. She told me that I had dislodged a fist-sized rock and that it had fallen just 4 feet and landed squarely on her left index finger. Damn it! I felt terribly guilty and also worried about how we were going to get her off the mountain safely if she couldn't even use her left hand. Scrambling back down the west ridge would be impossible for her. There was only one option. We would have to descend the very steep snow slope on the north ridge. Thankfully we had the gear for it. But if a fall occurred, would she be able to arrest it without a strong left-handed grip? I knew the snow on the north ridge was extremely steep at the top and accidents have happened there before. Better not to think of such things. The crux section of the west ridge route First things first. We had to finish this present route before we could even reach the north ridge snow slope. Natasha was temped to take the glove off immediately and examine the damage. I thought it was a bad idea and said so. I didn't want the sight to freak her out, and furthermore we needed to finish this exposed scrambling before the swelling got worse. In my estimates, we were only a few hundred feet below the summit. I offered to let her lead at her own pace and without any more rockfall danger, but she preferred to follow me. Natasha fought through the pain and made it to the top. We found a spot out of the wind and gingerly removed her glove. The finger was ruptured, split open from the nail to the second knuckle. On the under side, a sliver of bone appeared to be protruding from a small hole. A compound fracture? I could also see signs of some internal bleeding. There was another hole at the tip of her finger where blood had actually exploded out from the pressure of impact. I gently wrapped the finger in gauze and then gingerly helped her put the glove back on, for some minor protection. On the summit, She took it better than I did Preparing to descend We didn't waste anymore time. We put our crampons on and got the axes out. She would now have to downclimb the north ridge snow slope facing-in. There were no other options. I led down, double-kicking each step to make sure they were bucket deep and secure for her. She did amazingly well on the descent. She said that the cold from the snow was actually helping her hand. After descending 300 feet, the slope lessened and we were able to turn around and face out which made for faster progress. Downclimbing Steep Snow Traversing down and to the left was not easy for her since she couldn't hold the ax in her left hand. After some struggling, we came back to the boot path and then finally the spur road. At the main logging road we decided to trade bikes because the brake lever on my bike is easier to squeeze than hers. It took us another 25 minutes to ride 7 miles downhill back down to the car. Our round-trip time was 12.5 hours. I drove quickly to the emergency room. The doctor had to cut the glove off because of major swelling and dried blood which was like glue. An x-ray revealed a fracture, but what had appeared to be exposed bone was merely soft-tissue poking through. Thank goodness it's not a compound-fracture, I thought to myself! We were both very relieved about that. They cleaned the wounds with an iodine soak, trimmed off the dead skin, and then wrapped it all up. She was given a script for Vicodin and Doxycycline, but she opted not to fill those since we already have doxy left over from our recent Nepal trip, and as for pain, she would rather just take ibuprofen. Throughout the whole ordeal I was amazed by Natasha's good attitude, despite her suffering. I wondered if I could have handled the situation as smoothly if it was me in her shoes. Probably not. Internal Bleeding The rupture-split after trimming In hindsight I think of how many times I've been hit by rocks that were fist-sized or bigger. All I've ever gotten were bruises. Could we have done something differently?  Perhaps there would have been less rockfall danger if we'd stayed on the crest of the ridge.  This incident has made me think again about the dangers of mountaineering and I have had to take stock on what is most important to me. What would we have done if the rock was bigger, or the injury more serious? What if she hadn't been able to downclimb from the summit? These thoughts give me pause and I don't have all the answers. Are we going to stop climbing after this incident? Absolutely not. Will we always do what we can to minimize the risk? Absolutely. Broken finger on the summit Hospital Bandages It has been several months now since the injury took place. Natasha's finger is completely healed, albeit with scar tissue. And so we have traded places, for it is I who am currently injured and cannot climb. Just as soon as she was able again, I took a fall in the mountains and tore something inside my shoulder. It's strange how sometimes in life, you experience a situation from a different point of view, and relive something though another perspective.

But, it sounds like both of you handled the situation like champions. I used to take my wife, not a climber but she used to be a scrambler, on 3rd class routes. I always took a 40 foot section of 7 mm rope and a couple of 1"" tubular slings for the parts I wasn't sure about. That short piece of rope came in handy only a couple times, but I always felt better having it with me. gimpilator - Sep 18, 2013 2:00 pm - Hasn't voted Re: Great report! Thanks Marc!

multi-day,"The Art of Mountaineering: A Series of Great Climbs
Introduction ""All good things come by grace. And grace comes by art, and art does not come easy."" -A River Runs Through It It had been a long time since Gimpilator and I went on a climb together. We were invited to climb Fortress and Chiwawa Mountain with some folks from nwhikers, but before that we wanted to climb Ruth Mountain. Fortunately we got more than we bargained for with great success. On August 3rd Art drove us to Mount Vernon to meet up with Joe for the climb. The night before the trip we negotiated the gear supply of what to carry and figuring out the route. After spending over 100$ during the month of July on my mountaineering trips I was low on cash and had to go on cheap food like donuts, peanut butter sandwiches, and other goodies. Day 1: A Beautiful Day on Ruth MountainWe left for the trailhead at about 4:30 a.m. early in the morning and got to the trailhead around 6:30 a.m. It was a beautiful clear day, with conditions 100% in our favor. The hike started out down in the valley nice and cool but with high humidity. Gimpilator Hiking through the Valley Stream Above Wet Tiger Lillie Along the way there were a few minor creek crossings with snow bridges covering them up which for me required a few tricky moves to get over. Behind me I could hear Joe yelling out to me, but I could not understand what he was saying because he was distant. It turns out he was trying to warn me about a bear that was 15 feet away from me that I had no clue that it was there. Near Hannegan Pass I changed from my approach shoes to my boots and left Joe's bamboo stick near the trail which I had used to climb over tricky spots and use to reduce spider webs in my face. At Hannegan Pass the sun finally rises above the mountains which from here we ascend the lower slopes of Ruth Mountain. Along the way we see many of the famous peaks in the area including Mount Baker, Mount Shuksan, Hannegan Peak, and the Picket Range. Mount Shuksan's North Face Hiking up on the Lower Edge of Ruth Mountain Ruth Mountain with Mount Shuksan Snow Patterns Mount Baker's East Face Hannegan Peak Goat Peak Neat Lighting near By Tomyhoi Peak After traversing around the North Arm of Ruth Mountain we soon decide that its time to rope up considering that we could not see where the glacier starts because of the heavy snow pack this year. As usual, I got to be in lead position of the rope team which I enjoy doing. Ascending Ruth was a lot easier than I had originally thought, either its a easy summit or I been climbing a lot of mountains these days. But none the less very enjoyable with a nice ridge ending. Climbing up the Ridge Excited to Reach the Summit The Summit Ridge The Picket Range Butterfly on the Summit Mox Spires to the North Looking Down towards Icy Flowers on the Summit On the summit we enjoyed a great vista of the Western Part of the North Cascades. To the South there was much cloud build up, fortunately for us we happen to be at the right area at the right time. After spending around a half hour on the summit we had to head down for our next climb the following day. Summit Panorama Nooksack Glacier Panorama The descent was pretty easy with some mini standing glissades and with firm snow. After passing down past Hannegan Pass we came to the spot where I left my shoes which Joe discovered that his bamboo stick had been stolen. Joe was not a happy camper, which he went running up the trail to find who ever took it. After 20 minutes of searching he finally had to call it quits. Who ever stole it, not cool of you to have done that. Heading Down Ruth Mountain Ruth Mountain from Below Shiny Tiger Lillies Sefrit with Flowers On the way down the mountain my ankles were starting to hurt from all the climbing that I had been doing, plus the fact that I was wearing tennis shoes down the mountain. As we were crossing one of the creeks there was a bit of a move you had to do, as I walked over onto a rock I did not see that it was slippery. Suddenly I slipped on it and fell right into the creek. When I fell I hit my knee a bit hard which for a few seconds I was unable to move, fortunately Joe rushed to the scene and helped pull me out while I was getting a bit wet. Fortunately nothing major, although a interesting moment of the trip. We took it a little easier on the way down which before I knew it, we were back at the trail head. We then went to Gimpilator's house for the next round of adventure. Day 2: Hiking into the Fortress MeadowsGimpilator had me stay the night at his house which I had watched the movie ""180 Degrees South"" which was a amazing documentary about a adventure to Patagonia. The next day we left late in the day to avoid the hot weather. It was near sunset when we started hiking the trail to Fortress basin. As we hiked up the valley it became dark with lots of mud at a few places. At the basin we met up with a few people from nwhikers near the big creek of the basin. This was the most mellow day of the trip. Before going to bed I looked out at the stars, amazed to see to many and how I could see where I was without a flash light. Day 3: Climbing Fortress and ChiwawaIn the morning I woke up to a pounding noise right next to me, I look over and see a deer running in a field of meadows. Then I see 30 or so mosquitoes on the bivy sack I was sleeping in. Fortunately non of them were able to bite me, but it was a little intimidating knowing once I get up I would have to deal with a bunch of them. We all woke up around the same time, which we started the usual breakfast making. I could finally see that we were in a beautiful meadow with many deer running around in the flowers. Chiwawa Mountain from the Meadows Camping in the Meadows Deer Walking in the Meadows Deer on the Move Enjoying the Food Here After packing up all our gear we were instantly met with one of the more interesting parts of the trip. Crossing the Creek. Lucky for us Gimpilator had brought his flip flops which I used to cross the creek. Then Gimpilator would attach it to a ski poll and throw it back over for the other partners. Unfortunately as one of our partners were crossing they dropped one of there boots which was already starting to drift away. I immediately walked in after it catching it just in time. Crossing the Creek Hiking the rest of the meadow was a easy walk through swampy like lands. From here we then started ascending up Fortress Mountain while aiming for the gully. Before the gully we had a bit of a scramble section that we had to climb over, I eventually had to bail off of it due to the crack being too muddy. Fortress Meadows Crossing another Creek Fortress Mountain Reflection Fortress Meadows Ascending up towards the gully From here we traversed over and to our surprise were right at the gully. I went straight up the snow slope while everyone else took the moat route. In the Moat After the moat we came up into the basin which we climbed up a few thousand feet of minor switch backing and traveling on snow. Hiking Up Fortress Mountain As we got towards the East Ridge one of our partners was not feeling so great about the idea of the steep snow, so they stayed back on a rock and waited for us as we climbed on. After a few hundred feet of semi steep snow climbing we were now one the east ridge. Gimpilator going onto the East Ridge Glacier Peak from Fortress We had to take it slow here due to steep and exposed slopes as well as loose rock. The ridge got quite interesting in a few spots, although manageable if one is careful. I agree with Gimpilator's opinion that the ridge was class 3 with a move or 2 of class 4. Near the end I was amazed at how the summit ending was so snowy, yet still traversable. So we all carefully traversed it, which there was one move one of our partners did not feel comfortable doing, but with Gimpilator's encouragement they managed to make it to the summit. Climbing to the Summit of Fortress Summit 360 View Copper, Fernow, Seven Fingered, and Maude This was perhaps the best view of Glacier Peak I have ever had. In the distance we could see clouds coming in which were coming at us at a rapid pace. After being on the summit for around 20 minutes we started the descent. Walking along the Ridge Down Climbing Going down was easier than I had expected, we made it down to our partner in decent time. From here we traversed down towards the Chiwawa Mountain col. As we get near the bottom we realize that Gimpilator was waiting behind with someone else because they did not feel comfortable with semi icy slopes. Gimpilator Glissading Down Peaks to the South Kolos Peaks Heading Down Fortress Mountain So in a sense this was the beginning of our group splitting into two separate groups. From here I take lead breaking in steps up the snow slopes of Chiwawa. Rather than going at a monotonous casual pace up the mountain, I decided to try something new. My technique was to climb up 30-50 feet at a rapid pace, and then take a break until everyone caught up. It was a more thrilling way to climb a mountain. As we climb up we started to wonder if Gimpilator was going to attempt this. To our surprise a while later we saw him running up the mountain which we now knew he would too make it. Looking Up Chiwawa Mountain Silence on the Mountain After getting off the snow I looked up and could see that a group of climbers were now near by us. We climbed on for another minute until suddenly one of the climbers above lost his footing. He immediately planted in his ice axe which seemed to do nothing. Sailing down the mountain he gained speed very rapidly, which by now everyone was watching. As I watched I slowly walked towards the direction in which he was falling. He slammed into the rocks which flipped him over onto his back and he rolled over and then was falling once again. Almost as if helpless he was flying down the mountain in full motion. My heart was pumping at this moment, we were all held in suspense. I then dashed for the spot that he was about to land into to help at least lower the impact. I made a grab for him which of course I was not able to stop him but I believe I managed to help slow him down. He then slid past me which I wish there was more I could do. Fortunately he fell onto a less sloped rock pile near by and managed to completely stop his fall. Immediately people were rushing to him, which my friend Gimpilator was one of the first people who spoke to him. ""I'm certified in first aid responder, what is your name"" which he went through a series of questions. Amazingly he had no serious injuries, mostly a few scrapes and such on his arm. He was wearing a helmet with a long sleeve shirt and pants which seemed kinda thick. One of my partners than had a word with me ""Josh! That was stupid of you to have done that. You put your self at risk and could have gotten hurt."" The words of criticism did not change my mind one bit. When someone is in trouble, especially when they are helpless and there is something I can do, I will not stand around and wait for anything bad to happen. Now obviously I didn't jump completely in the way, but I knew I could help, which I have no regrets to what I did that day. In the past I've had situations where my mom was falling down a ice field below Headlee Pass, and I jumped in the way which stopped her from continuing to fall down. Everyone on the mountain was silent by this point, when ever I spoke one of our group members said I should wait awhile before anyone would want to talk again. The group dynamics fell apart for a while, for a temporary period of the trip I was separated from everyone. As we climbed up I could see the section which he fell at, the snow looked a bit loose which had us worried. Matt, Joe and I decided that it would be best to try out the rock section to the right. This turned out to be a fun/ dangerous decision. The rock scramble started out class 3 and then went into class 4 terrain. Looking down below I realized that this was more dangerous than anything previous we had done the entire day. But it was too late to bail on the route, I hate to admit it but despite the danger I was still having fun on the route. After the rock section it was a couple hundred feet of walking on rock until we finally reached the summit of Chiwawa. Bonanza Peak Looking Down North Phelps Ridge Below Purple Flower on the Summit Glacier Peak with Clouds Fortress Mountain with Clouds We did not stay long on the summit because it was getting late in the day and our group had completely fallen apart by this point. After walking for a little bit I managed to find Matt and Joe while one of our other partners was way down below. We carefully then scrambled down the mountain until the terrain became friendlier again. Looking Down Chiwawa The Upper Slope Mountain to the South Looking Towards Buck Mountain Gimpilator and Maria were separated from us which we did not see until we got back to base camp many hours later. To speed things up on the way down I got a few nice glissades as well as some standing glissades. It was interesting to look above and see that the cloud deck boundary was literally above Fortress Mountain. The foot prints from earlier on were already melted away from the heat of the day, so we decided to go down what looked like a quick easy gully. ""Looks like we will be back to camp in a little more than a hour"" Matt said excitedly as we rapidly lost elevation. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Heading Down Chiwawa Alpenglow on the Ridge Red Mountain with Maude The Moon Above the Ridge After ascending off the last snowfield the slope then suddenly got steeper until it dropped off. Looking all around I instantly realized that we were completely surrounded by cliff bands. We did not want to go all the way up so we went up a little ways and tried different gullies. This turned out to be a bit of a adventurous part of the trip. By this point we were all quite tired and the sun had already set which meant that day light was very limited. It just so happen that there was a solar flare that day, even though my partners had gps's, they were not accurate. ""The gps says we are on our tracks"" announced Tom knowing that we were far from our original way up. Pink Sky from Fortress Red Mountain during Evening Clouds Coming over It was starting to get dark, so we had to make a decision fast, and of course make sure it would be the right one. So ultimately we decided to go all the way back up the gully and traverse the lower portion of Fortress Mountain and go onto the edge of the south ridge. This turned out to be the way, although with a few minor complications. I then finally decided to put on my crampons as we traveled down the gully we had come up. After down climbing the gully we were back into trees, we decided against taking off our crampons due to the muddy steep terrain we were in. As we went further down we missed the creek crossing spot, which we then followed it a ways down in the dark until we got to a safe crossing. Near the meadows there were many fallen over trees on the edge of the mountain, it's amazing how far avalanches go down in the snowy seasons. As were walking though the woods we see fresh foot prints. Camp was now close at hand, and before long we were at the creek crossing. Everyone but me crossed with there boots on, I figured Gimpilator was still in the mood for Red Mountain the next day which is why I preserved them. After a cold crossing I got to enjoy some warm food and some well deserved rest. Day 4: Hiking up Red MountainIn the morning we packed up our gear and got ready for Red Mountain. For the next many miles it was a nice walk through the forest on trail and old road. Once we were about half way up Red Mountain Gimpilator decided for us to go straight up the side of the South Eastern slope. This turned out to be a nice and easy scramble. The Trail to Red Mountain Blue Ridges to the South Fortress Mountain The Route up Red Mountain We took it easy hiking up the slope, one of our partners was not pleased with all the loose rock on the mountain. Soon we were on the summit ridge. Red Mountain's Summit Ridge Bonanza Peak To the summit it was a safe and sun scramble up and over along the ridge. According to Gimpilator, he considers it to be the best views of the area in comparison to what we did previously during the trip. Phelps Ridge, Bonanza, and Dumbell Mountain Glacier Peak Panorama Red Mountain Panorama Soon after we made a speedy descent down the mountain. Once we got back to the road I was able to wear my approach shoes once again which was nice. We had some great talks on the way down. Heading Down Sunset from the Valley Sunset on Buck Mountain It was quite nice getting to the car, finally I was able to once more get a drink of water. Once again I was pleased to have gone on more great adventures in the mountains.

multi-day,"Old Men and the Kautz
Mt Rainier - Kautz Glacier Route This photo shows the different approaches or descent route we used. Kautz Glacier - Mt RainierFrank, Mike and I attempted to do this route as a two day trip in 2003 but 500 miles of driving, a late start and 9000 vertical feet of climbing proved to be too much for the three of us. Even though we had perfect weather and snow conditions, the trip was a non-stop 3 day grind and frankly, not much fun. We came back in 2004 with a new plan where we would stay one night on the cleaver (9000') below the Turtle snow field and the next night below Camp Hazard (11,300') giving us a rest day before we went for the summit. We also had the time to find the slot and the short rappel into the gully that leads to the ice cliff and onto the Kautz. We took off from our camp at 12:30 AM and climbed solo by headlamp until daybreak came as we were just below the crest. At 6:45 AM we were on the summit. We hung around for at least an hour as the sun warmed things up and then down climbed the route. We spent one more night below Camp Hazard and descended in the early morning when things were relatively quiet. As we descended the Wilson Glacier we heard a lot of water running under the snow and in the distance, a waterfall. Frank suggested that we avoid the fan and descend across the Wilson to the Nisqually. We were familiar with the route across the Nisqually from our previous trip on a low snow year and didn't think much about the decision. After jumping a crevasse and plunge stepping down a relatively clean stretch of the Wilson, we came to a maze of crevasses that were running in several directions and it looked like we were going to have to re-climb the 500' we had just come down. Mike and I were resigned to the fact that we had just screwed up when Frank announced that he had spotted a solid snow bridge that appeared to lead through the maze. He called for a belay so we dropped our packs and got ready to set some anchors. As Mike and I came down closer I could see that the bridge was solid but it had what appeared to be a 150' overhanging left side and a 50' drop on the right. I shouted to Frank, ""that sucker looks like it's 150' deep."" Ever the geology professor, Frank said ""umm..., they are rarely over 140' deep due to the compressive forces at the bottom of a glacier"". Under my breath I said, ""WTF, it looks like you fall, you die"". The crevasse crossing was both terrifying and stunningly beautiful at the same time. The ice was aquamarine to deep blue, unlike any colors I had seen on this earth but the bottom was as black as a coal mine. The bridge itself couldn't have been wider than 3 feet and it was maybe 30' to get across the narrowest section but what a walk it was. We went across quickly, one at a time only to find that it led to more ice cliffs. Once again, Frank spotted a line and with the temperature warming up it was time to get off this glacier. We zig-zagged down the ice fall on more bridges and finally got out to the relatively flat section of the Nisqually where we took a break. Just as we dropped our packs we heard a crack and rumble only to look up and see a large serac crash exactly where we had walked 30 minutes earlier. It was a great relief when we finally walked off the Nisqually and back to the trail. We were very fortunate to have the luxury of timing our trip to be able to climb in perfect weather and snow conditions. We started up the mountain just as a front moved out and high pressure was building. We had clear skies and freezing temperatures for all three nights making for great snow conditions and little activity from the cliff. For me and Mike, it took 4 trips to get a weather window like this. We had been blasted off this mountain many times in the past so this trip was magic.

I swore off going to Rainier in the early season after being snowed off 4 different times in the month of June. Around July, we usually get a big high pressure ridge that builds up over the western U.S. that produces days and even weeks of clear weather. Having been beat down and whipped before, we didn't leave for Washington until we saw a good weather trend developing. Viewing: 1-2 of 2 to post! Don't have an account?"
single-day,"The Armstrong Summit Troll
The Armstrong Summit TrollOn the summit of 4600-ft Armstrong Mountain in the Okanogan Mountains of Washington State lives a troll. This particular troll is a pretty emotionless creature. You might say he is stone-faced all of the time. His will is as strong as granite. He is granite. One can drive rather easily with a high-clearance 2WD to the summit of Armstrong Mountain on the Colville Indian Reservation. It’s about four or five dirt miles off the highway. At the summit is a very tall steel lookout tower built some 50 years ago. The tower is now abandoned and the compartment at the top no longer has a roof. The tower does not sit right on the summit. It’s pretty close. But not quite. Why doesn’t it sit on the summit? Because that’s where the summit troll sits… In June 2010 Stefan Feller and I visited the summit at the end of a trip out that way. It was getting late and it was raining. We saw the troll in the woods and were scared off. I vowed to return with weaponry, if needed. In July 2011 Jerry Daniels and I returned with weapons enough to slay the troll. Or at least smite it into submission. Or at least troll whisper it into obedience. Something. We got there and it began to rain. How nice. Luckily it stopped soon after it started. But it rained just enough to wet the rock and cause showery mini-waterfalls off the overhangs—especially above a section we would have to climb through. In order to dominate the troll you have to climb up on top of its head and drill a spike into its skull. From the lookout tower the granitic blob does indeed have the appearance of a rock monster with shoulders and a head—the head itself being what looks like an avulsed block resting on a slant. The easiest route up the 60-ft-high troll is Class 5. There are three or four route possibilities. They would need scrubbing to work into favor. The easiest route, and the one presumably done by others (there is some minor graffiti on the upper rocks), is on the south side—opposite the side of the lookout. A Class 3 slab in a crease gets one up to a rightward ledge under an overhang. There is small alcove here. Just past the alcove by a couple of steps is a weakness—a wide crack with chickenheads—at a point where the ledge thins to the point one needs to worry about falling off and down 15 feet to the ground if one should peel off the crack. The crack would be awkward to protect…unless you have a #10 and/or #11 hex (the cowbell hexes). I used my cowbell hexes! I used my cowbell hexes! Anyway…the crack is about nine feet high. To the right of the crack are other features to aid the moves. At the top one exits left to a flat. This first 9-ft weakness we rated at Class 5.4 if dry, Class 5.5 if wet. The holds are great. Great for hands; thinner for feet. Jerry led it in rock shoes. I followed in boots (and a heavy pack full of “gear”) and if it weren’t for my wedding ring getting caught on the first move I might have done it gracefully. After the first weakness and the flat shoulder there is another short step. Whereas the first section is largely a crack weakness, the second section is a face about ten feet high (more like a wall, then). The face is about 20 feet long and there is possibly another route at its right end. But we simply went up the middle of the face using more thin ledges and holds. It seemed a little harder—possibly due to the wetness on the lichen. We rated it 5.6 if wet, perhaps 5.4 if dry. So, over all, we think this route (the easiest route) is Class 5.5. Other routes up it would range from 5.8 to 5.11+ but would need scrubbing. But this is Indian land, so you probably shouldn’t do too much of that. To get off we found a bolt, a shiny new one, complete with a short chain. So if you climb it you won’t have to leave a rappel ‘biner. A rappel on our 30m rope got us back to the ledge by the alcove (a ten foot free-hanging rappel for the last part), then a second rappel on what was left of the rope down to the base to avoid having to downclimb the Class 3 crease. Either way. We rappelled because we had the rope for it. And thus was smote the troll. The End (of this fairy tale).

multi-day,"Inspired to Climb Spire Point
Introduction Last year when heading down Eldorado Peak I saw Spire Point's North Face blazing with sunset colors. It looked impossibly difficult, but perhaps that's what caught my attention about this mountain. I studied maps and looked at photographs which all made it seem like a far off fantasy. Interest for this peak arised when Matt Lemke and I wanted to do the Ptarmigan Traverse during the month of August. Matt talked with Gerry Roach about potential routes and did all the research for this peak. Just before heading out to do the Torment Forbidden Traverse, I received a last second invite from Gimpilator to climb Dome Peak. After a few conversations our trip was reworked and set for a 4 day trip. Alpenglow on Spire Point from Eldorado Video by Gimpilator Spire Point itself proved to be an exciting fun climb with low 5th class. This peak is in one of the most remote places in Washington giving the sensation of being a long ways from home. Along the way I saw many amazing things and had a great overall experience. This was perhaps the most experienced team I've ever climbed with which included Jacob Smith and Ryan Hoover. By the end of the trip I was certainly inspired. Spire Point from Dome Peak : Photo Taken by Matt Lemke Rappel on Spire Point Glacier Peak with Lake Upper Dome Glacier Arch Spire with Sloan Hiking on Dome Peak Day 1: Biking the ValleyWe met up at the Suiattle River Road trailhead. From here we pulled out our bikes and made some last second gear arrangements. Before long we hopped on our bikes and started the 10 mile bike ride up to Downey Creek. Sunset from the Valley Biking the Suiattle Road Near Downey creek we stopped to rest for the night. Jacob and I built a camp fire which we all had some fun conversations and joked a bit. But after a while we had to get rest for the big day ahead. Day 2: Approach DayWe woke up, made some breakfast, and were pretty soon on the move up the Downey creek trail. The path was mostly flat and was in great condition with a few minor creek crossings. After 6 miles of hiking we took a rest and filled up water near the bottom of Bachelor creek. The trail did not have as much brush as it's reputation made it out to be, I suppose it's gotten better in recent times. On our way up the valley there were tasty blue berry bushes as well as a few salmon berries. Almost all of us were going to town on them until most of them were gone. Creek Crossing on the Trail Creek View on the Way Green Scenery Above Purple Flowers Misch Peak to the West Orange Mushrooms We took a short cut variation that cut left instead of right which by passed the slide alder section. This variation followed the edge of the woods until we arrived at the avalanche debris section. The route got a little steep here, but was still hikeable. Before long we arrived at the saddle above Cub Lake which was a great picnic spot. Creek Crossing on the way up Bachelor Creek Heading up the Avalanche Debris The Edge of the Spire Point Group As we hiked down toward Cub Lake we could very clearly see Glacier Peak to the South. Around the corner we could see the saddle that we later would camp at. Unfortunately my feet got soaking wet due to the mud sections. I guess that's what happens when you wear approach shoes with huge holes on both of them. Everyone who see's them tells me I ought to throw them out. But they work well most of the time. After a little while longer we arrive at the saddle where we placed our camp. Looking South toward Cub Lake Hiking up the Basin Spire Point's South Face Looking towards our Camp area This was certainly one of the better camping places I've been to. The sunset was a great treat. Dome Peak during Evening An Awesome Place to Camp Looking Down the Valley Late Day Lighting Excited for Dome Peak and Spire Point View from our Camp Alpenglow on Dome Peak East and West Spire Point Sunset to the West Sunset on the Dome Glacier Alpenglow on Bannock Mountain Sunset from our Camp Day 3: Summit Bid on Dome PeakWhen we woke up we were welcomed with a beautiful sunrise. The following pictures portray many of the fun moments during our ""short"" climb up Dome Peak.

Bannock Mountain Clouding Over Sunset on the Clouds Alpenglow on Dome Peak Day 4: Spire Point and OutWe agreed at this point to split up, Matt and I were going to climb Spire Point and head out in the same day. We left camp around 8:00 a.m. and made great time most of the way up Spire Point's south side. Near the top we traversed the edge of the glacier and onto the bottom of the climb. Heading to the right it started out as class 2 but as we went right we got to a class 4 chimney which was fun. I wanted to take some pictures of this part but my camera had ran out of power. Matt fortunately backed me up. The Ridge near our Camp Approaching Spire Point Spire Point's East Face Myself wondering what to Do Here I was on the sharp end exploring around the corner which did not look friendly. Sure it looked possible, but without rock climbing shoes, without a belay, and with a pack on I did not feel comfortable with the idea. If I couldn't see what was beyond it and I knew that I could not safely down climb this spot. Looking around I found a rock that would work for belaying. Matt brought two nut cams and decided he would lead this section. Both Matt and I agree that it was low 5th class. Matt safely made it up top and belayed me up very close to the summit. The last section was kinda slab like. I belayed Matt on a horn, only one of us could summit at a time. I lowered him down which it was my turn. The summit ending was very exposed but was exciting and safe enough roped. There was a nice anchor on the summit to get down on. Using the horn we belayed on we used it for the rappel. The First Rappel Views to the South Scramble Section Spire Point North Towers Rappelling down the Class 4 Section Spire Point's Summit Block Rappelling down the Class 5 Section The rest of the way down had a little scrambling but was mostly a walk down. Back at camp I saw Gimpilator enjoying the scenery which normally he would rather climb peaks. But I don't blame him one bit. Matt and I packed up our gear and had to make good time to get down all the way to car before dark. We managed to find a trail on the way down though the avalanche debris but it had a lot of fallen trees in it. Once at Downey creek the trail kept going on and on which every corner I thought for sure it would be close to the road. It was almost dark by the time we arrived at the bikes. We biked fast to escape the night. We almost made it, but was forced to put head lamps on. At about 8:55 p.m. we arrive at the car which I was very pleased. We had finished two amazing peaks and enjoyed 4 great days in the mountains.

single-day,"Lib Ridge in a Day
I could see the wheels turning in Pete’s head as I asked him if he would join me. “Let’s talk later.” he eventually said, and went back upstairs to work in the climbing department of Mountain Chalet. We didn’t have time to talk about it at the moment, the store was busy with skiers, runners, and casual shoppers. A few hours later Pete brought a map of Mt. Rainier and began to lay out a plan to climb Liberty Ridge in a day. Years ago, I’m not sure exactly when, I began thinking of climbing the Ridge in one fast push, no camp. I have friends who have done the route, and heard their stories of fierce storms and rock falls that rocked it daily. I saw pictures of the huge crevasses lining its approach and the ice wall and bergschrund guarding its exit. Given all the dangers one is exposed to on this treacherous mountain, wouldn’t it be safer to limit the amount of time you spend on it? One day would logically be safer than spending three to five days exposed to arctic-like storms and life-threatening rock falls. But could it physically be done? At that time, I knew the answer was no. But, over the past few years I’ve concentrated on long runs in the mountains to build up a good base of endurance. The summer before this I ran the Leadville 100 and found out what a long day really looks like. Liberty Ridge would combine a lot of things for me. The skills needed to traverse three crevasse laden glaciers, strength to kick up a six thousand foot ridge of snow, rock, and ice, and of course the endurance to link it all together. Maybe more important would be the wisdom that only comes from being in the mountains. What do we bring with us, and what do we leave behind? What weather is good enough? When do we decide if we are going to turn around? Pete Lardy was the obvious choice of partners. As a climber, he was calculating and safe, as opposed to my approach which was just to launch into something and see what happened. He also had big mountain experience, having climbed Denali and taking part in Himalayan expeditions. He knew how to plan the logistics of a big trip and sort out the small details most would overlook. We felt strong and ready the day we caught the plane. Flying over Washington, we caught our first glimpse of volcanoes in the distance. We finally saw what we thought was Rainier. “Well that’s not so big,” I thought. Then the plane banked right and revealed an enormous peak weighed down with heavily crevassed glaciers and dark, rocky ridges. My palms started sweating with anticipation and fear. One day? Once at the Park, we drove to the Ranger station in the rental car and paid the necessary fees and red tape. I watched the expression in the Ranger’s face change as Pete told her our plan. She motioned to the other Ranger for back up, and waited for his arrival before she started persuading us not to go through with it. “This is a very strenuous route.” She said. “ I advise you go heavier and slower on this one boys. Bad weather can roll in unexpectedly and that’s when people start dyin.” We totally understood their perspective, and knew that they must deal with a lot of noobs and idiots who come there not knowing what they were getting into. We just hoped not to initiate ourselves into that category! We compromised and signed up for a bivy site “just in case” though it wouldn’t do any good considering the fact that we wouldn’t be bringing tents, sleeping bags, or camping gear of any kind. Our only protection would be a goretex and a lightweight down jacket. Gear on Lib Ridge (each): Crampons Ice axe Ice tool Short picket Two locking carabiners two wire gate carabiners one quadruple length runner Two prusiks Two screws Two shoulder length draws 5lbs of food, mostly gu and bars 4 liters of water And , one 60 meter twin rope and a small stove Although we widdled the packs down as much as we could, we were surprised to find that they weighed nearly 40 lbs each. A lot of it was the large amount of water we had to carry so that we wouldn't have to stop and brew up more water. We drove to the trailhead mostly to see where it was, and to talk to anyone in the parking lot about conditions. Everyone we found there was wiped out from their climb, and reported deep slush. But, they were all hiking at low altitudes during mid-day. After hearing a few stories, Pete and I came up with a plan. We’d go back to camp and pack up, get a few hours rest, and leave the trailhead by 3 am. This would allow the snow to consolidate, and time for us to reach the Ridge before it softened up at the lower altitudes. As long as we moved fast, we could be back below treeline before nightfall. We slept a solid six hours. I knew my pack was ready and everything lain out. I’d gone over it several times just to be sure. We awoke at two, ate breakfast (a mountain house meal) and drove to the TH. We were hiking by 3am. The trail was mostly snow from the beginning, but was firm and straightforward. We got lost at one point, but only for about fifteen minutes. We topped out on St Elmo’s pass in around 5 hours. We roped up from there and crossed the Winthrop and Carbon Glaciers. Most of the crevasses were covered with heavy spring snow. The few that were open were easily avoided. Up to this point, the weather was questionable at best. The cloud level was low, and freezing rain was common. It wasn’t until we were half way across the Carbon that we broke through the clouds and saw the ridge above us, topped by blue sky above. It was only then that I knew the ridge would go. Pete marched us across the Glaciers like a pro, selecting the most direct lines and watching for tell tell signs of crevasses that I would not have known to look for. To gain the Ridge, we had to run wide left, across a massive crevasse, then come back down to the toe. The sun was now beating down pretty hard and loosing large rocks from the rockband above. We tried to move fast through this part, but finally ran into the soft, deep snow we heard about. A couple times we had small rocks fall between us, so I tried to move even faster, which was a mistake. I crossed over a small rise and stepped into a waist deep “hole” that swallowed my right foot. I tried desperately to free it, all the while thinking of the enormous boulders only thirty feet above my head. The snow setup like cement around my foot, and while I dug out with my hands, axe, and other foot, I sunk my other crampon well into my calf. OUCH! Pete was still behind the rise and had no idea what the hell I was doing. Once freed, we climbed loose, sketchy choss and ice to gain the Ridge. It had taken us 7 hours to get here, and another hour to pull up on Thumb Rock. A team of guided climbers was waiting at the bivy when we arrived. They had been watching us since we crossed the Carbon Glacier and congratulated us on moving so fast. They had taken two full days to reach this point, and were acclimating at 10,500 for the rest of their third day. One guy informed us that the best tent spots had been taken. We politely told him we wouldn’t be needing a spot, and were leaving in a few minutes after we had a snack. We ended up taking thirty minutes for lunch. One of the guides told us that someone had been left by his party near the bergshrund the day before, and said to look out for him or any signs of him. We gradually slowed down above 12000 ft. The altitude was one factor, plus we had been pushing it hard for ten hours, with a gain of 8 or 9 thousand feet. We roped up a pitch below the bergshrund due to ice, and found a nice ledge to belay from. I took our four screws and led out and over steep snow and ice for about thirty feet. While not technically challenging, this lead was a lot of fun due to the exposure and unpredictability of the medium. Above the crux, I went directly for the top, while Pete began simul-climbing to save time. I placed a tibloc in case Pete fell on the crux. The movement of the more challenging terrain excited me and through the focus I pushed it a little too hard. I placed a screw at the exit of the ice face on to liberty cap, and rested my head on the wall. When I opened my eyes I was looking between my crampons down to Pete 200 feet below, then on to Liberty Ridge cutting the Carbon Glacier like a knife. Below that, clouds crept up and shot out to the Pacific. This is the picture I should have taken, and will always regret not having done so. We steered left of Liberty Cap and sought shelter from the harsh, cold winds. At the saddle, we put on more layers and moved on quickly. 14 hours had passed. We skirted the left side of the true summit and cruised down the Emmons, again with Pete in the lead. As we dropped elevation, the weather again deteriorated. Pete was having a hard time seeing wands in the storm (I couldn’t see them at all!), so we were slowed a little. But, he always trended in the right direction and found our true course. The clouds lifted a little just above Camp Schurman, but the wind grew even angrier as it was forced over the Winthrop and around the Interglacier. Half a dozen tents struggled to stay attached. At the Ranger’s hut (about the size of a utility shed) we were welcomed by RMI guides and the climbing ranger. They were confused and thought we were lost because no one had gone up the Emmons all day due to weather. They thought we may have come down the North Face accidently after summiting from the South. We told them where we came from and what we were doing, and they were happy we were ok, in those “little booties” of ours. Pete and I passed up the double plastics for our lightweight leather mountaineering boots, which is not popular in the Cascades apparently. We spent about twenty or thirty minutes here eating and thawing our camelbacks (yes, we were dumb enough to use camelbacks). One guide pointed out the shortest way back on our small map, which he was even less impressed with. The snow was pretty loose past this point, and it took two or three hours to get back to the car from here. We did make it well below treeline before the sun set and forced us to fish out our headlamps. At the car I stopped my stopwatch at 20:01:57. The last thing I remember before passing out was sitting at the picnic table with Pete, as we polished off a post climb six-pack. Pete was nodding off and almost spilling his beer. I think his helmet was still on! We had given ourselves seven days to do the climb, but only had needed one and a half. We spent the next five days cruising the peninsula and checking out the sites. And, drinking more beer of course. A big part of our success on the trip was our ability to train for it at altitude. Pikes Peak is very close to us, and we spent three or four weekends leading up to the climb above treeline, and many months before that hiking and running Barr Trail. Though a big day, it wasn't nearly as hard as a few of the Ultramarathons I've run. My hat is off to the climbers who have to approach this thing from sealevel.

multi-day,"Time To Buck Up For Buckner Mountain
Getting Some Hands To Climb An ArmIn my ongoing quest to summit county highpoints and peaks with a lot of prominence, Buckner Mountain has been high on my ""to do"" list. With some mountaineering friends knowing this, I was recently invited to join several other fellow peakbaggers for a summit attempt of Buckner Mountain, which at over 9112' is the highest point of Skagit County and one of the highest points in Washington. The plan seemed simple enough. Ascend Buckner Mountain via its southwest slope, considered by many to be the least technical route. As such, this route potentially had the best chance for success if conditions allowed. With an expected trek of nearly 20 miles roundtrip in two days over a wide variety of terrain, we knew it might not be an easy trip. However, with a good team and positive attitudes, we were motivated to succeed. Eric Noel initiated much of the initial planning and group setup. Dennis Poulin, Dean Molen, Ken Russell (a.k.a. ""Dundeel""), and I were each invited on the trip. Adam Walker (a.k.a. ""Gimpilator"") was also invited to join the team, but he already had a Glacier Peak trip scheduled for the same weekend as the Buckner trip. However, within two weeks of the scheduled Buckner trip, Dean had to back out of the plans due to family commitments and Adam's Glacier Peak trip was cancelled (allowing him to join our Buckner team). The five-man team (Eric, Dennis, Ken, Adam, myself) for the trip was set. (Sahale) Arm WrestlingOur trip began the morning of July 10, 2010. We met at the Cascade Pass Trailhead at 7:00 AM, and began hiking by 7:30 AM. The plan was to ascend to Sahale Glacier Camp that day, and then the second day traverse east into the upper sections of Horseshoe Basin en route to Buckner Mountain. It was already known that Adam and I considered possibly attempting Sahale Mountain that day. After an hour of hiking up the trail we got Eric's permission to continue on ahead of the group so that we would have extra time to possibly make a Sahale Mountain summit attempt that afternoon. Eric, Dennis, and Ken, in contrast, had all day to enjoy the scenery and reach Sahale Glacier Camp. Looking Up At Cascade Pass Adam and I reached Cascade Pass at 9:45 AM. We turned to our left (north), and saw the next major section of our ascent: Sahale Arm. Shortly before reaching the pass, we encountered several snow slopes. Shortly after leaving the pass, we switchbacked up the Sahale Arm Trail, weaving between snow-covered slopes and melted-out meadow slopes. We reached a small saddle at approximately 6000' elevation, and then began traversing left (northwest) for a short distance. We could see the beautiful colors of Doubtful Lake and it's broken-ice top below us, to the north. Soon, Sahale Arm began trending northeast. This mid-section of Sahale Arm was mostly melted-out. Marmots were seen throughout the meadow ridgetop. Heading Up Sahale Arm... One Of Many Marmots Seen On Sahale Arm Adam and I reached Sahale Glacier Camp at 1:00 PM. The few other tents in the area were located behind small rocky outcrops on the ridgetop. However, we felt the best way to avoid a lot of wind exposure was to put our tent in a small snow basin near where we reached the Sahale Glacier Camp area. In the long run, it might not have mattered. The wind seemed to reach each of the tent sites, although I personally noticed much more wind velocity on the ridgetop than in our small basin. We kept looking up at Sahale Mountain looming nearby to the northeast, and were ready to try locating a low-technical summit route for that peak, if possible. Our Campsite At Sahale Glacier Camp We began ascending towards Sahale Mountain by 2:00 PM. We reached the point where snow met the summit block within one hour, only approximately 50' vertical elevation from the summit. In the days leading up to our trip, as well as during this particular day, we had correspondence with multiple people regarding a possible YDS Class III scrambling route up Sahale Mountain. Our goal was to locate that specific route, if possible. We traversed to the area where the route was supposed to be located. Unfortunately, current conditions eliminated that option in several ways: a snow cornice was located there, multiple rock moats were located there, and multiple boulders had exposed ice on them there. We then traversed back around the summit block to look for other scrambling options. Approaching Sahale Mountain... Within two weeks of our arrival, we knew of other people who found a snow ramp going up to the summit but that appeared to be long-since gone. Eventually, we saw our three climbing partners arrive at Sahale Glacier Camp below us. We decided to head back to camp to eat dinner and rest for the following day's goal, Buckner Mountain, which was my main goal for the weekend. Adam was aggravated at not finding a low-technical route for Sahale Mountain that others had claimed. I tried keeping his spirit high for the rest of the evening by reminding him of the larger mountain that we were to attempt the following day. Buckner... The ""Easy"" Way?After meeting up with our team, having dinner, and going over the plan for the following day, I went back to our tent and decided to take a nap. While laying in my sleeping bag, as the sun went down behind some ridges and the outside air cooled, Adam woke me up to tell me about a strange phenomenon. Millions of tiny black snow worms littered atop the snow surface. I chose not to get out of my sleeping bag to see them, but they were still out when we awoke at 4:00 AM the next morning (July 11). The plan was to leave by 5:00 AM, but several of our partners were not quite ready and still needed to eat some breakfast before starting the climb. We ultimately began our climb by 5:30 AM. We each brought harnesses, and the team had a long rope, but ultimately those items would not be needed. We began by traversing east towards a large rock rib (ridge) angling southeast from Sahale Mountain. Before reaching the rock rib, we descended ~400' elevation down a steep snow slope to the rock rib. We had been advised by several other climbers that although it was possible to traverse down steep snow slopes the entire gully until reaching Horseshoe Basin, it would be much safer to scramble down the rock rib until reaching the basin. With the current snow (and especially snow melt) conditions within the gully there were plenty of hidden stream channels under the snowpack, as well as slick boulders and icy sections. The rock rib definitely seemed like the best option, although perhaps later in summer when less (or no) snow is in the gully that option might be better. Summit Trek From Camp Begins! The scramble down the rock rib was fairly straightforward. However, there were enough sections with loose dirt, loose rock, and the necessity of ""veggie belays"" to warrant extra caution. If the rock rib had been wet, I would never recommend traversing along it. At approximately 6750' elevation, we found a notch containing a steep snow finger heading down into Horseshoe Basin. We had heard about this particular snow finger being a possible entry point for the basin, but with the current conditions (we had seen several avalanches on nearby ridges during our trip) and the uncertainty of the snow slope (and angle) we opted to find another way to the basin. I mentioned the possibility of side-traversing across the large snow gully and then downhill ~200' elevation to a large rock outcrop that marked an entrance to the basin. The traverse involved briefly crossing steep snow slopes that passed over a stream under the snow, but the snowpack was still deep enough and firm enough to pose any fall-through or rock moat issues. While taking a break on the rock outcrop, a three-man mountaineering team passed by us, also en route to Buckner Mountain. Heading Down Rock Rib... ""Veggie"" Belay-Assisted Scramble On Rock Rib Looking Back Up At Rock Rib... It's amazing how sometimes snow can alter depth perception and slope angle perception. From where we entered Horseshoe Basin, the traverse to Buckner Mountain did not look appear to be a long route. But then, as we continued eastward for a while the basin seemed to just get bigger. As we watched the mountaineering team ahead of us become dots in the distance, it became clear just how big the basin really was. Similarly, the southwest slope of Buckner Mountain looked like a very steep (60°) slope from a distance, but as we approached closer it appeared to be only a 30°-40° slope. That also became much more clear as we watched the mountaineering team ahead of us. Looking Back While Crossing Horseshoe Basin... Looking Ahead At Southwest Slope Of Buckner Mountain Adam and I found ourselves leading our team for a majority of the time from when we first entered Horseshoe Basin until reaching the steep snowy southwest slope of Buckner Mountain. Dennis followed right behind us, but Eric and Ken were consistently finding themselves behind the rest of the team. Eric and Ken took a long break at a rock outcrop while Adam, Dennis, and I continued up the steep southwest slope of Buckner Mountain. By the time the three of us were over halfway up the slope, we noticed that Ken had turned around and headed back towards camp but Eric had started continuing behind us again. Eric And Yours Truly Take A Break Adam Ascends Southwest Slope... We were saddened that Ken chose to turn around, but we knew he would just retrace our snowy route path and he had a ""SPOT"" locator beacon in case of an emergency, so a lot of our concerns were alleviated by those things. With Ken's departure, we were actually shocked at how fast Eric ended up ascending the southwest slope. Eric liked to joke how he was fast downhill but not uphill, but this definitely went against that thought. Adam, Dennis, and I reached a small rock outcrop at a saddle approximately 150' vertical elevation from the summit, with only a scramble section remaining. We decided to wait for Eric. To our surprise, he showed up only a short time after we had. We did not know if it was because he was following firm steps already in the snow or not, but his time ascending the long snow slope was still impressive. He is a much more gifted mountaineer than he lets on. Dennis And I Ascending Near The Top Of The Southwest Slope... After taking a break at the rock outcrop, we left our gear there and the four of us reached the summit at approximately 11:30 AM, six hours after we left our camp. We enjoyed the 360° panoramic views for about 15 minutes, but saw clouds approaching in the distance. We briefly considered also traversing to the northeast peak, but large snow cornices and potentially treacherous rock moats obstructed the possible routes there. Although a small number of climbers think the northeast peak is the highest point of Buckner Mountain, a vast majority of climbers (including me) believe the southwest peak is truly higher... even if by only 2' elevation. Given the conditions, it would have been too dangerous and reckless to attempt the traverse to the northeast peak. I am content with that decision, as I am content with the thought that I was on the true summit of Buckner Mountain. Final Summit Scramble... Adam, Eric, And I At Buckner Summit Dennis At Buckner Summit Adam recorded a short video while at the summit. We soon scrambled back down to the small saddle where we had left our gear. Even after spending a short time snacking and reshuffling our backpacks, we descended the steep southwest slope. If the slope had been icy, firm, or partially melted-out (i.e. half-rock/half-ice), it might have been difficult to descend. However, with soft midday snow we were able to make good plunge-steps and great descent time. Eric made the descent look quick and effortless, even adding a short glissade at the bottom of the steep slope. Adam and I followed, plunge-stepping the entire way down. Dennis followed behind us, but had a brief fall on the final steep slope which required a lengthy self-arrest before he stopped. He was uninjured, and we fortunate that would be the closest incident to injury for any of us the entire day. Just When You Think Things Will Go Smoothly...Adam, Dennis, and I reached Eric at a small rock outcrop near the base of the southwest slope. After taking a short break, the four of us agreed to split into two groups: Adam and I as the first team, and Dennis and Eric as the second team. This was because Adam and I had to be back to our vehicle (and home) that evening due to scheduled plans the following day, while Dennis and Eric planned to camp overnight again at Sahale Glacier Camp. Another area of concern (at least for me) was the steadily lowering of clouds filling the entire sky and covering over all of the terrain above 8000' elevation. Clouds Moving In, Adam Moving Out Adam and I made great time crossing Horseshoe Basin. On the other side of the basin, when we reached the eastern edge of the rock rib, we had two choices: traverse around the rock rib as we had during our trek earlier that morning, or ascend the steep snow finger which was more clearly in view than earlier that morning. I was concerned with the unknowns of the snow finger, but Adam was concerned with traversing back around the rock rib. Seeing recent footprints (from within one day of our arrival) up the snow finger, Adam began traversing up the snowy slope and I trusted his judgment and experience enough to follow. Ultimately, it turned out to be the correct decision as it was fairly straightforward with soft snow (but would have been more dangerous/technical with firm or icy snow), and it saved a lot of time. Adam Ascends Steep Snow Finger To Rock Rib Notch... From the notch on the rock rib, we retraced our route from that morning and ascended the rock rib back to the snow slope. By the time we reached the final snow slope leading towards Sahale Glacier Camp, we noticed three main things. First, the three-man mountaineering team was only a short distance ahead of us, halfway up the final slope. Second, there had been a lot of rock fall on the north side of the slope during that day. Third, the cloud-cover was thicker and lower than before, making the top of the final snow slope appear to have near-whiteout potential. The assertion turned out to be correct, as visibility decreased substantially near Sahale Glacier Camp. Fortunately, I had my GPS track log to guide us, when needed and when our general scope of the terrain was ""clouded over"" (so to speak). Eventually, we found Ken at his campsite, and our campsite was only a short walk downslope from that location. We arrived at our camp by 3:30 PM. Adam, As Seen In Near-Whiteout Conditions At Sahale Glacier Camp Ken, Adam, and I (as planned) each gathered our belongings, tore down our campsites, and got ready to begin descending to our vehicles together. Before we left, Dennis and Eric returned safely to camp. They needed to filter some water, so they borrowed Adam's filter for about 20 minutes. During that time, thinking Adam and I would catch up, Ken began heading down Sahale Arm. After Dennis and Eric were done borrowing Adam's filter, we each said our ""good-byes"", and then Adam and I began our descent at 4:30 PM. After dropping approximately 200' elevation from Sahale Glacier Camp, we found ourselves below the cloudline. However, where the clouds ended the wind began. The wind gusts must have easily been 30-40 MPH while we traversed the ridgetop of Sahale Arm, before the final switchbacked slopes leading to Cascade Pass. Once we reached the pass, we found Ken there waiting for us. Adam and I were slightly shocked that Ken made it down to that location so fast. In fact, he had been waiting there a while (as we had earlier seen him there from higher up on the route). Ken, Adam, and I then hiked down the final 3.7 miles together back to our vehicles. Heading Down Sahale Arm... We arrived at our vehicles at 8:00 PM. Being late on a Sunday night, our hopes of finding a suitable place to eat that was still open was unlikely. However, Ken knew of an Italian restaurant in Sedro-Woolley that was open until 11:00 PM. In theory, we had plenty of time to get there. Unfortunately, within a few miles of driving, immediately before reaching the Eldorado Peak Trailhead, my back driver's side tire had a full blow-out. I quickly pulled into the trailhead parking area and stopped the car. Ken, who was driving right behind me, stopped to assist. We soon had my spare tire put on, although I had to drive much slower than I had hoped from that point on. We made it to the Italian restaurant at 10:35 PM, and they were happy to still seat us and allow us to order before closing. Although no other customers entered the restaurant after we had, the owners waited patiently while we ate... and we were happy to give a generous tip in return for the hospitality. Ken, Adam, and I left the restaurant at 11:15 PM, with Adam and I finally arriving back at my house by 12:30 PM. Thinking that nothing else could possibly happen, I entered the house to find... my dog missing. Apparently he had quietly walked outside when somebody had our front door open about 1h30m prior to our arrival, and nobody realized his departure. The general assumption was he was sleeping. With a rainstorm now in full effect, and giving up hope of somebody opening the front door, it appeared he sought shelter from a nearby bush-tree within a block down the street. He came as soon as I walked to the sidewalk and called him. At least he was safe and sound (albeit very wet), and it put an extra asterisk onto what will be one of the mountaineering trips I will look back on fondly in the future.

Klenke - Jul 13, 2010 3:41 pm - Hasn't voted What? No NE Summit too? Roper is going to be getting on your case six ways to next Sunday! It's not that a small number believe the NE summit is higher. We just don't believe that the NE summit is surely lower. It is not that it is; it is that it maybe isn't what it isn't. Redwic - Jul 13, 2010 5:27 pm - Hasn't voted Re: What? No NE Summit too? I was already well aware of John Roper's stance about reaching both peaks. We were going to do it, and had the beta to do it, but we all agreed the current poor conditions of the traverse while we were there would have been too risky to attempt. I was only going to do it to satisfy Mr. Roper, whom I have never even met in person, and I think Dennis, Eric, and Ken were only going to do the traverse for the same reason. Adam was indifferent. I respect Mr. Roper's opinion (as well as yours, or anybody else's) regarding this controversy, but I am going with the majority on this one, including what I consider credible evidence (although not scientifically verified) from some prominent peakbaggers that the southwest peak is slightly higher. If Mr. Roper wants to put an asterisk by my name for now then so be it, but I am satisfied with having summited this peak. Buckner Mountain is a great mountaineering destination. mvs - Jul 19, 2010 6:21 am - Voted 10/10 Re: What? No NE Summit too? Great TR Redwic.

I searched all around the base of that rock for a somewhat safe ascent and only found solid class four on loose wet rock, not worth it for us. I am surprised that Buckner is a less technical ascent, it looks gnarly from the flanks of Sahale. Redwic - Jul 19, 2010 2:02 pm - Hasn't voted Re: nice TR Agreed. From Sahale Glacier Camp, the snowy southwest slope of Buckner initially looked like 60° and quite imposing. Then a ranger told us it was 40°. Then two people we passed the morning of the summit trip, who had just done the North Face of Buckner, told us the southwest slope was only 25°. As we got closer to the mountain, we knew 25° was too low of an angle and 60° was definitely too high of an angle. The southwest slope was probably around 35°-40°, manageable with good snowpack, with the final summit block being a steep scramble. skjos - Jul 20, 2010 10:40 pm - Hasn't voted TR Helped Us Out Hit Sahale, Buckner, and Horseshoe last weekend and your trip report helped us judge route conditions.
